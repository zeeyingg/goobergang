### Data
#### Description
We collected our data by building an HTML scraper (```parse.py```). This tool both collated and performed calculations on our data, before storing them inside JSON files. Using the HTML scraper, we were also able to pull transcripts from the website with their timestamps. You can view all the source data on Kaggle. For a more concise view of all our calculations, you can view the Google Sheet.
