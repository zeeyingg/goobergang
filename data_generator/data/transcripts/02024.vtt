PROFESSOR: So having
established the importance

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.220
of airborne transmission in
the spreading of COVID-19

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.980
specifically, and more
generally in the spreading

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.470
of respiratory
pathogens, let's proceed

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.940
to analyze airborne transmission
in a well-mixed room.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.950
So we're thinking
of a situation where

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.740
a certain number of people
are sharing an indoor space.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.320
And the air in that room
is well-mixed enough

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.830
that as pathogen-containing
droplets are released

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.320
from the breath of one
person, it's quickly spread

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.670
throughout the whole room.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.710
And by the time someone
else breathes it,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.770
they're essentially exposed
to the average concentration of

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.990
pathogen in the air
after accounting

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.380
for such effects as the
settling, the evaporation,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.440
the ventilation, filtration,
and other effects,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.340
but still at the level
of a well-mixed space.
