PROFESSOR: In Chapter 1,
we'll study the transfer

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.330
of respiratory pathogens.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.540
Specifically, we'll consider
bacteria and virus, which

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.530
originate in the lungs or
in the pharynx in the body

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.710
and are transmitted
by forming droplets

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.400
during the act of exhaling--
by breathing, or speaking,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.950
or other respiratory activities,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.380
and we'll study the
fate of those droplets.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.660
Will they shrink by evaporation?

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.130
Will they fall and sediment
to different surfaces?

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.520
Or will they be inhaled by an
susceptible person

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.790
and thereby transmit
the infection?
