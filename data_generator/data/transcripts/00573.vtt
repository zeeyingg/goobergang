00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.280
JULIAN BEINART: Let me first
explain what the end art is.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.840
The cover of The Economist
talks about a fundamental change

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.120
in economic use of
distance, arguing that,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.020
if telephonic
communication becomes

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:00.795
free, what would its impact
be on societal life and space?

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:11.340
The second part is a book,
which now not very popular,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.940
called Explorations
Into Urban Structure.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.180
It follows a book
called Cities In Space,

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.980
which contains Melvin Webber's
classic article, which

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.440
I'll refer to, order
within diversity.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.970
It's in the reading.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.220
It's in the required reading,
so don't worry about it.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.880
But the diagram on Figure 4
is taken from Explorations

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.920
Into Urban Structure.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.950
This was an attempt
to make sense

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.140
of the complexity
of interchanges

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.940
in a contemporary
city, particularly

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.500
in the United States where
there are levels of--

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.510
this is an attempt to mark
a kind of new geography

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.940
of communication.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.450
It's best read
about in the text.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.740
I just put in this
diagram to remind you

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.980
that, if you ever got
interested seriously

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.540
in the creations of metropolitan
form and its options,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.450
this is material that
you should access,

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.270
not that it promises
any solutions.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.940
But like Melvin
Webber's argument,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.530
it says that we need to take
more seriously a different kind

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.440
of attitude towards
metropolitan form

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.310
than that which is
conventionally supplied by--

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.980
I would use Webber's term a
bit later in a few minutes.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.740
The next page is
two pieces of my own

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:10.290
written for the one conference
in New York on the downtown

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.340
conference from the
Rockefeller Foundation

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.100
for Urban Journalists.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.820
So it's written in the kind
of hip way for discussion,

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.560
but it deals with material
on the American downtown

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.280
and the change.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.340
It ends up with a
hypothesis that one

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:45.580
of the relationships
between downtown and suburbs

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.215
is a homeostatic relationship,
arguably, crudely speaking,

00:03:52.215 --> 00:03:56.740
that the more you move away,
the more you will counterbalance

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.906
homeostatically.

00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:03.340
And the growth of
the exurb in America

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.930
has been correlated to
a growth of the center

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.180
because the center has grown
rather idiosyncratically, given

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:21.399
that 25 years ago it was the
absolute destination of disuse

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.790
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.540
And the last piece
is a response I

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.020
was asked to give at a
symposium here at MIT where

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.400
Manuel Castells was awarded
the Kevin Lynch award.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.130
And I took a kind of
nasty turn and had

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.870
to deal with the question
of whether information

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.580
technology would help improve
city and regional form.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.430
I said some nasty things.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.250
And a lot of people thought
that I was more correct

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.470
than the panelists.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:14.320
But you can read it
in your spare time.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.130
These are just
notes on the subject

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.340
that we're dealing with
in some ways or other.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.160
Look, throughout
this class, I've

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.670
been giving you material not
for the sake of adding paper

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.510
to your compendium of stuff.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.690
It's really got a couple
of reasons behind it.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.950
Number one, there's
not enough time

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.360
to deal with all of the stuff
that I want to deal with.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.880
And showing slides is
not an adequate way

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.200
of representing verbal dialogue.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.910
It works when you are depicting
certain formal material.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.110
And when you're
not, it's difficult.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.990
Secondly, for those who believe
that this class will teach you

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.560
that there is a single
theory of city form,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.660
I debunk that proposition.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:39.790
We started this class with a
comment I made about the fact

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:46.150
that 1,000 miles from where
I was born archaeologists

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.520
named Broom, Dart and Tobias
discovered Australopithecus

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.620
africanus, the first major
transition from animal

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.590
to human dated 4
million years ago.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.150
Brain size was 400
cubic centimeters.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.670
Brain size today is 1,450.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.820
I went through Robin
Dunbar's gossip theory

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:25.370
about brain size in 150
size communities and so on.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:35.880
Discussions about the
city are very recent.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:42.460
City's only 12,000 years old
even if we stretch the time

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.870
by 2,000 years.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:49.120
I'd say it's more like 10,000
years as opposed to 4 million.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.600
It took 4 million years
for the human brain

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.880
to decide to settle
permanently in a place.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.710
And we are now 10,000
years in advance

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.960
of the first human settlement.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.070
It's nonsense to assume that
we have worked out everything.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.050
Boston has improved
in the period of time

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:22.230
that I've lived in Boston
significantly for most people.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.140
For some people, it hasn't.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:30.340
There is no single practice
of urban design in Boston,

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.820
which deals with the
metropolitan problems

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.789
of the city.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:40.350
When the New England Patriots
decided to build a new stadium,

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.919
they didn't appeal to a
metropolitan authority

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:48.450
to decide where the maximum
location would be to benefit

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.000
the metropolitan area.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.800
They went around to
every small town.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.820
And they ended up in Foxborough
because Foxborough gave them

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.680
the best deal.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:08.230
They then applied to the state
to pay for improvements in road

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.670
transportation to the stadium.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.140
This is the way we do.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.330
This is as much
theory as there is.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:25.060
And you have to live with us
as practitioners and theorists.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.990
God alone knows that they'll
be a consummate one theory.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:32.440
We'll need a certain
set of agreements

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.800
that I can't foresee it.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.120
Two of the topics that I'm going
to deal with today, the one

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.300
deal with the technology,
current technology,

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.660
and its effect on
metropolitan form.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.220
One is the technology
of reducing distance

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.320
by virtue of systems.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:02.710
And the other is the
advent of notions

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:07.240
that the way we are operating
at the moment in urbanism

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:12.940
is increasing the carbon dioxide
content of the atmosphere

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:22.820
and posing, if contested, risks
to the planet, which can only

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:27.500
be dealt with through
universal action.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:32.120
You remember that I said
Woodrow Wilson arrived in Paris

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:40.070
in 1918, 1919, advocating
that the world join forces

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.260
in the League of Nations.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.490
He received the
largest crowd gathering

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.630
in the history of Paris.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.360
Of course, the League
of Nations didn't do--

00:10:53.360 --> 00:11:00.860
we've done well in controlling
what my generation took

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.910
to the street.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:06.420
And that was atomic
nuclear energy.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.310
The nuclear bomb was our threat.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:15.590
Computers weren't even
part of the human activity

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:21.320
in any mass way, but the
threat of the nuclear bomb

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.390
caused our taking to the street.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:29.810
There would be no significant
use of nuclear bombs

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:30.950
since that time.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.710
How is that we can agree on--

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.450
one of the questions
I would ask is,

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:49.170
what constitutes agreement
on matters which emanate out

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.575
of general goodness?

00:11:54.540 --> 00:12:00.795
And our history of responding
to threats is very short.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:09.230
Over the last month
in the United States,

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.860
we've tried to cause
people to remember

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.990
the death of 27 people.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:19.730
I think it's 27 in
Connecticut, hoping

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:24.020
that the death of small
children at the hands of guns

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:31.160
would arouse enough enthusiasm
for some modest controls on gun

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.730
use in this country.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.430
The Congress, which is
elected by the majority

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:41.000
of the population,
refused to even debate it.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:49.890
As far as I know, given
that the mayor of New York

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:57.870
is on his last legs, not bodily,
but in terms of his tenure,

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.680
I would like to watch
over the next few years

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.390
what Hurricane Sandy is
going to cause in climate

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.650
prevention in New York.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:15.030
I'd like to see all
of New York's suburbs

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:24.930
undergo an enormously expensive
proposition of putting all

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:28.950
the power lines underground
instead of in the air, which

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:37.440
causes enormous
disturbance of power supply

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.920
and so on and so on.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.710
We're going to watch people
rebuilding on land which should

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.100
be used to soak up water.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.120
This is still
happening in Florida.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.920
We're very poor at
making decisions even

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.760
when we have significant threat.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.300
Climate change has no
immediate significant threat

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:10.780
except for hurricanes in
New York and New Orleans.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:19.270
But the correlation between
that and public response,

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:25.150
even when the body of science
is vectored to agreement,

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.880
let me just--

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.350
while we're talking about that.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.460
There's a Professor
called Michael Mann

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.930
at Yale University.

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.920
He's one of the most
outspoken theorists.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.950
He's a professor of
meteorology and geosciences.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.900
Mann recently wrote a
book about his experiences

00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:00.370
called The Hockey Stick
and the Climate Wars.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:04.420
Over the last 15 years, as his
research has gained prominence,

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:09.430
he has been called a liar,
a charlatan, and a scumbag.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:13.540
His critics have
demanded his erased.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:25.710
Blogger Marc Morano called for
him to be publicly flogged.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:28.980
Morano's former
boss, Rush Limbaugh,

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.100
said they should be
drawn and quartered.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.970
This is in a democratic society.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:42.540
His office at Yale has
been girded with police

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.390
and taped as a crime scene.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:49.840
He's received threats to
himself and his family.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.870
He has been the
focus of lawsuits

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.260
seeking the public
release of his emails.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.610
Mann is arguably the nation's
most hated climate scientist.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:19.170
I will argue that there are two
threats to urbanism in the form

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.850
that we are practicing it.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.360
One of them is
fundamental change

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.480
in climate and
its repercussions,

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.170
particularly in the poor world.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:33.210
The region around
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:37.200
is particularly
susceptible and one

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.770
of the poorest
regions in the world,

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:44.275
from Bangladesh all the way to
Iraq around to Southern China.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:54.790
And secondly, the
question of social equity,

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:59.790
which I'll discuss
somewhat on next Tuesday,

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:06.990
these are the two
unresolved world problems.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:12.000
The one is new,
human engineered.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.250
The other is old and
human engineered as well.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.060
There have been thousands
of books written

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.089
about the right of
us to achieve wealth

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:26.500
at the expense of others.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.610
Marx contended
with that argument,

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:43.410
but didn't take into account
the pursuit of wealth and power

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:48.000
by the people who put
his theory into practice.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:56.550
But I'll try to do some of
this summary more extensively

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.040
next Thursday.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.695
Let's go back to the
American city and distance.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.490
In my little comment
with Castells,

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:42.220
I quote from an article in Time
magazine, February 21st, 2000.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:49.120
I quote, this is from the
architect Wes Jones's work.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.620
"Computers promote a dramatic
trend towards decentralization,

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:58.658
allowing people to spread out
and live and work anywhere."

00:18:58.658 --> 00:19:01.360
Now, my comment is
this-- despite the fact

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.690
that downtown residential
growth in US cities

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:10.010
is now at the same rate
as for metropolitan areas.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.100
Secondly, the
vastness of cyberspace

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:17.160
increasingly satisfies the
craving for more space.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.950
So the house and
yard will shrink

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:23.190
to a more supportable
size, this despite the fact

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:28.890
that the average US house is
now 50% larger than in 1970

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.160
while family sizes
declined by 20%.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.890
It's unfortunately
true that architecture

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:45.310
borrows a lot of its
ideas for complex reasons

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:51.370
from people who decide to
make a solution to a problem

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.975
and then state it as fact.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:02.910
It's impossible to take
Corbusier's writing

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:08.670
on the base of factual evidence,
yet he's the world's greatest

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.420
architect of the 20th century.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:16.260
This discrepancy is
interesting because it

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.160
is associated with factual
observations such as these made

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.210
by young and claiming
to be on his way

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.550
to fame young architect.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.450
Polemic and manifestos
and pamphleteering

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.470
don't reach the level of
Goebbels in Nazi Germany,

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.660
but they come close to--

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:44.130
I think it's part of the
notion of the whole complex act

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:47.760
of the brain in
producing architecture.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.230
It involves so many
domains of knowledge,

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:56.880
which have to be brought
together and traded off.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.780
And what gets traded off
in favor of many others

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.380
is the notion of creativity.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.310
the notion of producing
unique resolutions.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:19.170
When I did the architecture
education study,

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.480
it was interesting
to see how many

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.080
young people, young
architects or students,

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.320
say they chose
architecture because it was

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.900
both creative and respectable.

00:21:36.806 --> 00:21:42.230
They had ability to be creative,
not work in a large corporation

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.200
and take orders
from above, which

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.990
most architects have to do.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:54.290
But they pitted the life in
law and corporate business

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:58.310
against architecture because
architecture was creative,

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:00.950
but on the safe
side of creativity.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:04.430
It wasn't playing jazz
or going to the theater

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:11.390
or going into painting or
going into media, whatever.

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:18.050
It combined rationality,
science, and art

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:19.190
in a unique way.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:23.060
This has been the dogma
of architecture almost

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.710
since it started.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.370
And it's created a
world of greatest.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:31.340
Architecture is not
to be denounced.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:35.240
But when it comes to
urbanism, the truths that

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.750
come from architectural
statements,

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:46.720
Mel Webber asks
the question, which

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.550
is an interesting question--

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:54.030
he says, "we have
often heard, I believe,

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:57.540
in taking the visual
symbols of urbanization

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.850
to be the marks of the important
qualities of urban society.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:07.170
We have compared these symbols
with the ideological precepts

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.950
of order and found that
they do not conform.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:14.340
And so we have mistaken
for urban chaos what

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.430
is more likely to be
a newly emerging order

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:20.540
to signal qualities of
complexity and diversity."

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:32.820
He's the limited
geometry that we have,

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:38.700
and I don't know how limited it
is given advances in computer

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:43.420
understanding, to
blame for the fact

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:49.620
that we consider to be
chaotic in urban form what

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:56.430
doesn't conform to our ability
to make formal sense out of it.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.650
I don't know.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:01.380
It's an irritating question.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:05.970
I've had theses which have
looked at this over the years

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:11.310
and come to the conclusion
that it may be true.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:19.290
But one of the advantages
of computational systems

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:25.860
is that it may yet be able to
associate form with complexity.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:33.780
But as long as architects
keep on being trained

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:38.040
to work on the notions
of face to face contact

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:44.460
and visual order as opposed
to having order as equivalent

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.940
to architectural order,
I think we'll constantly

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.230
have problems of focus.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:56.560
So Webber, who's a
great social scientist

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:03.160
professor at the University
of Berkeley, now retired,

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.730
raises this kind of question.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.640
He says that--

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:16.870
I like to quote from writers
rather than paraphrase.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.360
"It is now becoming
apparent that it

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:28.080
is accessibility
rather than propinquity

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.900
that is the necessary condition.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.490
As accessibility becomes
further freed from propinquity,

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:38.430
cohabitation of a
territorial place,

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.670
whether it be a neighborhood,
a suburb, a metropolitan region

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:45.780
or nation, is becoming less
important to the maintenance

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.340
of social communities."

00:25:57.966 --> 00:26:02.110
A fundamental question,
which is not yet resolved,

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:05.830
is the relationship
between the value of face

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:10.840
to face contact and
machine interposed contact.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.760
Machine interposed
Goliaths claim

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:21.670
a minimum residue of importance
for face to face contact.

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:27.100
Although urbanists, particularly
architectural urbanists,

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:32.830
claim that higher density,
even the new urbanists who

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:36.160
don't even claim
for higher density,

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:41.560
claim that the geometric
propositions will cause people

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:46.960
to meet more frequently and be
friendly and have accessibility

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.720
and so on and so on.

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:56.180
Suburban life has not
lobotomized young Americans.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.715
Most of you Americans
grew up in suburbs.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.160
I'm not arguing for
the fulfillment of life

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:11.200
in suburban America, but I'm
arguing against the proposition

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.190
that they are dead.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.050
There are other reasons
why American urbanists--

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:25.020
urbanism doesn't work.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:29.010
There's a history to the
growth of suburbs in America.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:31.390
They didn't occur all at once.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:35.730
In fact, the latest
advent of computation

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.460
and virtual
communication is only

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:43.890
a new layer on a set of
facts that already the first

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:47.550
was already occurred
before the 20th century.

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:52.350
That's the advent
of the telephone.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.860
You read the book The Social
History of the Telephone.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.960
I think a part of it's
on your reading list.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.450
Let me find it.

00:28:33.655 --> 00:28:34.155
OK.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.520
The telephone was
first introduced

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:53.230
to make living in the
non-city more tolerable,

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:56.890
so that people on
farms could have access

00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:03.400
to health care in emergency
situations and communicate.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.515
They were seen as the
people most deprived.

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:12.370
The advent of the
telephone created

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:15.250
two contrasting situations.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:19.030
You couldn't have a skyscraper
without a telephone.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.130
If you had to have people
running up and down

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:24.700
to communicate over
100 floors, you'd soon

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:29.000
have a bunch of tired workers.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.680
In fact, secondly,
the rural population

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:40.270
depending on telephones
has become urbanized.

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:42.820
At the time of the
advent of the telephone--

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.680
it was prior to 1900--

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:52.090
70% of Americans
were farm workers who

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.930
lived in distant rural places.

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:59.230
Now, it's 3% of the population.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.360
I haven't got the
text in front of me,

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.865
so I don't know if these
figures are absolutely correct.

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:16.330
Henry George Wells,
the British futurist,

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:21.040
almost exactly 100
years ago wrote

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.770
that electronic dispersion
would be accompanied

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:27.400
by simultaneous
decentralization,

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.880
this binary notion that the
more you do one thing the more

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.960
the opposite is accomplished.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:39.880
Marshall McLuhan did it for
the arguing for the fact

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.040
that the cinema
would not disappear

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.520
given the advent of
television, that you

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:51.030
have a residual relationship
which is binary.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.500
He specializes in cinema.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.360
It becomes more of a spectacle.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.420
It becomes more of an art form.

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.600
Television doesn't do that.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.950
It occupies another niche,
although there are attempts

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:13.030
on television to do both,
provide spectacle and art

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.410
at the same time.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:24.170
H. G. Wells wrote this 100 years
ago on electronic dispersion.

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:27.770
"The businessmen may sit at
home in his library and bargain,

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:30.970
discuss, promise,
hint, threaten,

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:34.370
tell such lies as he dare
not write and, in fact,

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:40.390
do everything that once
demanded a personal encounter,"

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:42.175
incredible insight.

00:31:42.175 --> 00:31:44.590
This is before telephone
was even common.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.420
"And so the center
will be essentially

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.450
a bazaar, a great gallery
of shops and places,

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:59.170
of concourse and rendezvous,
a pedestrian place,

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:03.130
its pathways reinforced by
lifts and moving platforms

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:06.580
and shielded from the
weather and altogether very

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:10.850
spacious, brilliant, and
entertaining agglomeration."

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:15.490
I couldn't think of a
better verbal depiction

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:18.250
of Moses King's depictions
of New York, which

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:21.340
we looked at on Tuesday.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:28.720
And in fact, a Friday
night at 6 o'clock

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:34.220
in the evening in
downtown Boston,

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:40.730
when I was a graduate
student of your age at MIT,

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:46.820
Boston had virtually no
European based restaurants,

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.890
none of any quality.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:53.060
When I was visited by friends
and family from outside,

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:57.410
I had to struggle to find
anything which wasn't made

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:01.850
of white bread and hamburgers.

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:08.270
Now, the number the turn over of
restaurants is so frequent that

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:12.890
I cannot go to a restaurant
which survives for longer than

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:15.450
a couple of years.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:17.110
At least the number
of restaurants

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:20.000
that I used to go to
that have diminished

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.140
have turned over
enormously rapidly.

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:32.400
What has caused downtown
Boston to be attractive?

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:39.690
I list, in my piece,
a number of moves

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:44.760
both introduced by the
city and both introduced

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.475
by the change in culture.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.680
Who would have predicted that
the United States would invent

00:33:54.680 --> 00:34:00.200
the coffee bar, which you now
find in Cambridge, England

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:06.003
on the main street in one of
the more conservative zones

00:34:06.003 --> 00:34:06.545
of the world?

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:16.690
Who conceived the idea of
inventing a coffee distribution

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:20.094
system in Seattle of all places?

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.650
These are curious
predictions, but they

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:29.350
have something to say
about the centralization

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:32.560
and decentralization
of the world.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:38.320
What seems to be happening
is that the central parts

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.639
of our cities are
doing reasonably well

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:44.710
compared to where they were.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:51.070
Manhattan was virtually
bankrupt 30 years ago.

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:53.259
I'm not getting my dates
absolutely correct,

00:34:53.259 --> 00:34:54.820
but I'm guessing back.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:03.220
At the same time, we
have suburban growth.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:09.520
Suburban growth started
with the streetcar suburbs

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:17.490
according to the book by a
professor in urban studies.

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.333
AUDIENCE: Warner, yeah.

00:35:19.333 --> 00:35:20.250
JULIAN BEINART: Sorry?

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:21.630
AUDIENCE: Sam Bass Warner.

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:24.540
JULIAN BEINART: Sam
Bass Warner, yes.

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.480
I'm just confusing
names for the moment.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:33.060
Sam Bass Warner's book
is obligatory reading.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:41.440
The notion was that you
could move to Newton, commute

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.110
by street car suburb.

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:47.710
And if your wife
needed help, she

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:51.550
could telephone you in
the central business area.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:55.360
And you could do something
about it as far as possible.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:05.280
The moving outwards out
of the center of cities

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:10.620
has probably been a
doctrine of space form

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:15.780
since the beginning of
cities where it was possible.

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:19.590
If you could overcome
communication costs,

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:23.710
if you could survive
the onslaught

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:31.492
from people who wish to
take over your property,

00:36:31.492 --> 00:36:42.250
if you weakened [INAUDIBLE]
premise that at the same time

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:49.600
is archaic man took information
from the celestial system,

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.840
he also had a notion
of centeredness,

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:56.750
that the center was important.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:00.220
We've reduced the
notion of centeredness.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:04.480
I think in my slides of
Boston City Hall Plaza

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:10.510
and in Giorgio's,
who's doing his paper

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:18.520
on the perceptual space
of Boston City Hall Plaza,

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.010
you get a redundant
configuration

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:23.425
of the use of center.

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:35.370
This redundancy is
part of a process

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:39.510
of interchange between
the outskirts and center.

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:44.290
We've reduced the
importance of centeredness.

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:49.600
I could read you from Fishman's
writing about a couple who

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.560
live in New Jersey.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.190
He travels to New York
state every morning

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:59.140
on the freeway where he has a
job in White Plains, New York.

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:02.110
He teaches in a school 20
minutes south from where

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:04.900
they are in New Jersey.

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:09.640
The kids get dropped
off at school

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:13.990
or picked up by
automobile or buses.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:17.080
They visit Manhattan, the
center of the universe,

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:22.270
once every six months to
take the kids to a museum.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:24.550
They get The New York Times.

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:30.410
They watch television 6 hours
a day over weekends and so on.

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:37.850
This is a typical
contemporary suburban family.

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:40.540
They send their children
to university, probably

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:43.090
to good universities.

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:45.670
Because if you take
evidence from [INAUDIBLE],,

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:50.710
as I discussed on Tuesday,
people spend more time

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:57.550
on making sure that the kids
get the right form of education

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:58.990
in this class of people.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.410
The dilemma in
this country is not

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:06.590
that people don't
care about education.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:08.930
They either don't
have the capacity

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:14.550
to do anything about it and,
therefore, education is--

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:20.690
how do you understand the
paradox between the fact

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:23.210
that without any
doubt we have the best

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:25.760
universities in the world.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:30.170
Duke University, which rates--

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:33.450
I mean, the rating
system is flawed.

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:35.840
But according to
the rating system,

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.500
Duke University is a second
rate university in the United

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.590
States, probably has one
of the best medical schools

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:46.930
in the world and so on.

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:51.890
How do you compare
the binary quality

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:56.090
of the higher level of
performance in our university

00:39:56.090 --> 00:40:00.560
system and the weak, average
performance in our school

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.140
system, high school system?

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:06.920
How do you connect the two?

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:10.094
I don't know.

00:40:10.094 --> 00:40:16.093
It's a proposition which has
to do with a number of factors

00:40:16.093 --> 00:40:16.760
in this country.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.100
And we haven't got
time to go into them.

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:31.660
But the move to the
suburbs was accomplished

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:34.570
by a number of things--

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:37.570
technology, the
telephone initially,

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:41.530
the septic tank,
which allowed you

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:46.180
to find a unit of
occupation independent

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:51.730
of a municipal system, waiting
for a municipal system to come,

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:58.540
the capacity of developers
to operate quite freely

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:04.120
to maximize profit, the advent
of the federal government

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:08.710
in believing that home ownership
was an important stability

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:10.900
factor in a good society.

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.630
Herbert Hoover and
Roosevelt endlessly

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:18.910
talk about the legislation
which allows Americans

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:27.790
to deduct real estate tax and
interest paid on their house

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:43.080
as factors in minimizing their
federal and local tax payments.

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:46.500
This works against
rentership, which

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:51.810
is a more flexible system,
which I pointed out on Tuesday

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:56.730
has advantages for newcomers.

00:41:56.730 --> 00:42:03.390
Suburban growth, which manifests
a potential profit in home

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:08.110
ownership, must stand
in the way of bringing

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:15.355
in people of different color,
different capacity to pay the--

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:20.620
Bob Fogelson in the
Department of Urban Studies

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:22.630
has wrote a very
interesting book

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:24.920
called Bourgeois Nightmares.

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.280
I don't know if
you know the book.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.530
It's a history of the restricted
system of American suburb.

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:36.220
He focuses on Pacific
Palisades, which

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:41.935
is a couple of kilometers
from downtown Los Angeles.

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:49.480
It was one of the largest
suburban developments

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.920
in American history.

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:56.830
It was designed by the
sons of Frederick William

00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:02.530
Olstead, the greatest
American landscape architect.

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:04.610
It would not allow renters.

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:07.705
It would not like anybody
but the Caucasian race.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:14.400
It virtually did--
you had to conform

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:19.950
to a profile of whiteness,
income, et cetera.

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:22.380
Restrictive
conditions were a part

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.990
of American suburban growth.

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:30.090
And only court
legislation much later on

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:34.560
provided equal access
to American suburbia.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.860
So American suburbia,
like Newton--

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:42.150
well, I don't know the
history of Newton, but--

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:46.830
would be an adjunct
for white well-to-do

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:50.490
in the initial phases
rescued by the telephone

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:51.750
and the septic tank.

00:43:55.390 --> 00:44:03.510
With the greater liberalization
of American space,

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:10.170
the suburbs took on an
independent economic force

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:14.520
of their own and
slowly disseminated

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:18.780
the distance and
time spent commuting

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:20.690
to the center of the city.

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:29.170
The first shopping centers were
in Framingham, Massachusetts

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:33.450
that led to larger sized
shopping centers, Mondawmin

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:39.240
in Baltimore ending up with
these gigantic complexes

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:43.820
in Minnesota and so on.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.920
Work followed.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:51.200
There are more offices
in northern New Jersey

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.730
than in Manhattan.

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:54.680
Believe it.

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.110
As the metropolitan
space of New York

00:44:57.110 --> 00:45:01.580
includes northern New Jersey
as a metropolitan space,

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:06.590
as it should, there are more
offices in northern New Jersey

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:11.180
than in Manhattan, which is not
part of the human perception.

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:16.040
There's more commutation.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:19.320
Over 50% of work
commutation today

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:24.460
is from suburb to suburb and
not from suburb to central city.

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:28.040
There are a number
of these indices.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:33.710
The suburban world has become a
world of its own in one sense,

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:37.686
not dependent on
the central city.

00:45:37.686 --> 00:45:41.510
Now, who would do you
expect to be in City Hall

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:45.530
Plaza on a Sunday morning?

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:48.470
Somebody living in Newton
watching television

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:55.340
for six hours having friendships
which can be accomplished

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:59.420
over large distances?

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:02.540
I want to recall an
incident in London.

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:08.570
A number of years ago, London
contemplated London road system

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:12.450
has never been
expanded significantly

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:16.050
despite the increase
in automobile use

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:18.960
quite [INAUDIBLE]
large proportion.

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:30.110
London proposed building a box
highway to make transportation

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:33.530
from southern parts of
London to northern parts

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:38.330
and eastern and western parts,
as the city was expanding,

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:41.060
more and more possible
without crossing

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.410
the center of the city.

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:50.810
All architects and
environments opposed this move,

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:55.210
saying highways were just
opportunities for more

00:46:55.210 --> 00:47:00.680
automobiles, more
negative consequences,

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:05.680
aesthetic disfigurement,
and so on.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:08.320
The New Statesman
which I used to read

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:11.570
and used to read because they
wrote such good English--

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:13.630
I learned to write
English from reading

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:18.175
newspapers, good newspapers,
not from any other source.

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:25.590
The first international
publication I ever published,

00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:28.470
I rewrote 16 times.

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:30.584
So those of you,
especially those of you

00:47:30.584 --> 00:47:32.610
who are foreigners,
believe you can

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:36.750
write a thesis in a week in
good English, forget about it.

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:44.780
Learning to write, like learning
to draw, is a slow process.

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:46.520
You assume that
you learn to draw

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:50.950
as architects in
five years and don't

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:55.690
learn to use language properly.

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:57.760
Anyway, that's beside the point.

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.760
But the New Statesman
had an editorial

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:07.570
which attacked the opponents on
the grounds of social equity.

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:12.550
It says that what we
know about social trips

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:16.810
is they're seldom done
by public transportation.

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:20.920
Social trips are generally
done by automobile.

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.170
We are depriving
the poor people who

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:25.330
are now having
access to automobiles

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:29.895
for the first time of the right
to access the metropolitan area

00:48:29.895 --> 00:48:30.395
socially.

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:37.060
It would mean that
a young man who

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:41.420
lives in Wandsworth
in southern London

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:47.500
in a poor to middle income
community who meets a woman who

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:52.990
works in a same office
who lives in Hampstead

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:58.720
in northern London, if they wish
to date and there are no roads

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:05.020
to allow him to move freely,
that date will not take place.

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:08.440
Of course, it's debunked
by European examples

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:14.020
of people dating as a result
of subway encounters and so on.

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:15.880
But this was the argument.

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:23.110
The argument also applies to our
thoughts about climate change.

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:28.060
We've arguably gone
through a period

00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:31.870
of building an economy
based on the profligate use

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:34.480
of resources.

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:39.470
Now, that we've
established our state,

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:46.190
we are now arguing for the
diminishing of the poor world,

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:49.070
who are arguing that
the distinction for them

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:52.875
is the choice between smoke
and income and survival.

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:59.960
It's an interesting
dialectic between the search

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:07.250
for social equity and the use
of the metropolitan space.

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:14.940
Just a few facts about
information technology

00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:16.830
and urban space--

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:22.800
in 1997, only 6.3% of
the American population

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.530
worked at home on
a regular basis.

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:29.520
On an average, these people
only worked 19 hours a week.

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:33.810
Only a fraction of them
worked predominantly at home.

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:37.380
Less than half of the home
workers use computers.

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:39.390
The majority use telephones.

00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:41.580
That was 1997.

00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:42.825
I'm sure it has changed.

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:51.620
The notion of working at
home, the increase home work,

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:58.280
has an interesting counterpart
effect on automobile use.

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.340
Apparently, the more
you work at home

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:05.030
and the less you use roads,
the more opportunity there

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:08.180
is for the roads to be used
by people who don't use them

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:11.810
because of current congestion.

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:14.990
So there's an
extraordinary resonance

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:21.500
between reducing automobile
use on the one hand

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:27.020
by working at home and the
fact that those people who

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:29.510
work at home don't
use the automobiles,

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:32.870
reducing the amount
of use of the roads.

00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:39.230
Therefore, the use of roads
is an elastic commodity.

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:44.090
Automobiles use roads when
it's easy to use them and stop

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:48.680
using them when there
are enormous difficulties

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:53.350
either in congestion
or in parking costs.

00:51:53.350 --> 00:52:04.270
So one of the notions of
reducing automobile congestion

00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:08.350
is having people live
close to where they work.

00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:14.680
This is absolutely antithesis to
the idea of a liberal society.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:18.430
Again, you have a problem.

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:21.880
You live in a metropolitan
area because you have access

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:25.270
to free economic opportunities.

00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:29.920
Your husband and your wife
work in different places.

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:35.290
Much of this thinking
comes from pre-women work,

00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:40.390
comes from suburbs such as
Levittown or Framingham,

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:43.660
where women didn't work and
had time for social life.

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:53.100
If the family that I described
from Fishman's article--

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:56.550
the husband maximized
his work opportunity

00:52:56.550 --> 00:52:59.250
by working in White
Plains, New York

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:02.010
while they live in
northern New Jersey.

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:04.710
His wife teaches in school.

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:07.890
And the best job she can
get is 20 minutes south

00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:09.310
of where they live.

00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:14.430
So they have a 40 minute
spread between the two of them.

00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:18.390
Americans change jobs
relatively frequently.

00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:22.080
If you live in a metropolitan
area, changing a job

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:27.570
might not mean changing a
city or changing another part

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:29.550
of the metropolitan area.

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:32.370
Maybe if the road
system were adequate,

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:35.730
you could stay in your
house and change your job

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:44.218
because you can get freely
through private automobile use.

00:53:44.218 --> 00:53:46.180
We'll just look at
one or two more,

00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:49.260
and then we'll look at some
aspects of climate change.

00:53:59.210 --> 00:54:01.960
I quote, "so far, cell
phones haven't directly

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:04.300
altered the look
of public space,

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:07.420
but rather provided more
flexible use patterns."

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:15.340
A study done of
Boston cab drivers

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:18.430
says that cab drivers
are relying more and more

00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:24.010
on information from cell phones
than they are from teleradio.

00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:31.450
They say it's full of static
[INAUDIBLE] interference.

00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:33.790
The cell phone is more
timely and accurate

00:54:33.790 --> 00:54:38.530
than anything that comes out
of the static played radios.

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:42.455
I never thought that cells phone
would make taxi life better.

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.200
An analysis of households
in North America that

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:58.010
perform online activities
weekly by activity

00:54:58.010 --> 00:55:03.230
shows that 85% of the
internet is used for emailing.

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:15.670
The world's poverty gap
has doubled in 30 years

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:20.800
during the rise of information
communication technology.

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.860
Matthew Zook's analysis
of internet domains

00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:28.030
in 2,500 cities
across the world shows

00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:30.940
that the top five
cities, accounting

00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:33.550
for 1% of the
world's population,

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:39.280
account for 20.4% over
all internet domains.

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:49.518
There's more evidence of
the centralizing effect

00:55:49.518 --> 00:55:51.660
of information technology.

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:09.490
Our empirical work suggests
that telecommunication

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:12.010
may be a complement
to at least not

00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:17.780
a strong substitute for cities
and face-to-face interactions.

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:20.230
This is not written
by architects,

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:24.440
but by urban theorists.

00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:31.060
So we are currently
in a domain in which

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:36.460
we have to try to find
a reasonable balance

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:39.730
between face-to-face
communication

00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:46.180
and its advantages in machine
interpersonal communication.

00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:50.170
MIT is going crazy at
the moment debating

00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:52.900
as to what extent
it should reward

00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:56.350
students who learn
electronically,

00:56:56.350 --> 00:56:58.990
from electronic information.

00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:01.660
They have propositions
that it should shorten

00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:05.590
the residential time at MIT.

00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:09.280
MIT is based solely on
face-to-face communication,

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.870
not solely.

00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:15.490
You're sitting with
computers listening

00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:17.890
to face-to-face communication.

00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:20.170
But the central
basis of the teaching

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:23.200
is still face-to-face
communication

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:27.220
and the limited population
who can benefit from it.

00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:36.960
Over 36 years, I calculated
there have been 1,200-- no,

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:39.870
36 times 30--

00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:45.210
1,000 students in this class.

00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:48.210
Each of them is not--

00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:52.380
there are now versions of the
class in India, in Moscow,

00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:57.420
in Indonesia, one at Penn State.

00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:00.330
A number of our
graduates of this class

00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:06.360
are pleased about that, but it
doesn't compare to the effect

00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:12.050
that the filming of the
class might have published

00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:16.110
through MITx over time.

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:19.590
But the central domain
that you're living in

00:58:19.590 --> 00:58:25.560
is to make sense in your work
of the still unresolved balance

00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:32.850
between face-to-face contact,
which most architects prefer

00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:41.490
and which most pre-computation
theorists have accepted

00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:43.770
as the basis for their work.

00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:52.480
Boston City Hall Plaza
is a good example

00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:57.970
of reaching back into
the past to take account

00:58:57.970 --> 00:59:05.320
of a development, which really
is proposed to take account

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:09.010
of the context of a
modern metropolitan area

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:13.850
rather than a historic
center of a city

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:17.375
where the density
of the population

00:59:17.375 --> 00:59:22.070
and the amount of space the
population has have probably

00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.890
arisen cultural
tropes of association,

00:59:25.890 --> 00:59:31.070
face-to-face association,
such as in the Camp in Siena.

00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:35.480
The Campo in Siena
has used the space

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:40.550
not only for individual contact,
but for communal contact.

00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:44.840
The Palio twice a year
is a tourist event,

00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:50.840
but it's also a competition
within the various neighbors

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:56.780
of the city to make more
of the center of the city

00:59:56.780 --> 01:00:02.180
than it normally even provides.

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:05.690
What is the answer
to public space

01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:08.170
in the contemporary
metropolitan area?

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:11.890
No public space?

01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:19.010
Where is the public
space in Los Angeles,

01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:23.270
one of the great cities
of the contemporary world?

01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:27.890
Is there a square
in Los Angeles?

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.175
Yes, there is, but
it's not significant.

01:00:30.175 --> 01:00:31.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:33.440
JULIAN BEINART: It's
not a significant part

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:38.750
of the average Los Angelian
work or social life.

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:50.450
And yet it activates
enormous economic production.

01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:52.910
It's not backward
in its social life.

01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:56.600
It has one of the best symphony
orchestras in the United States

01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:00.215
playing perhaps the most
advanced music in this country.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:08.840
Hollywood hasn't gone
backward and died much though

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:15.920
how Adolf Hitler thought it
would because it didn't produce

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.995
a movie about the '32 Games.

01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:26.510
These are fundamental
things that you

01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:32.990
need to incorporate in your
work as an urban designer.

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:36.710
Maybe [INAUDIBLE] thesis
is a good substitution

01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:43.710
for there are now
125 farmer's markets

01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:46.980
in the metropolitan county
area, metropolitan area of Los

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:48.330
Angeles.

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:53.310
These are new adventures
which introduce

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:59.200
a form of public activity, a
decentralized form of public--

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.750
where commerce, which
is still probably

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:07.440
the foundation of
American public life,

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:14.760
is transformed into
a capacity to imagine

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:19.080
buying food from a
healthier provider,

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:22.560
a less-corporate provider.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:27.000
There's a good thesis done here
about four or five years ago

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.190
on the farmer's market in
Los Angeles as public space.

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:36.300
So what I'm arguing
is that, above all,

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:41.970
the metropolitan area has
enormous advantages to us.

01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:48.180
None of you would want to live
in small domains of 20,000

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:54.520
people unless if you
choose to live in,

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:58.480
unless you have enough wealth,
to live in Aspen, Colorado

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.950
where there are more private
airplanes at the airport

01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:05.470
than any other city in
the world per capita.

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:13.340
One of the problems about
climate change is this.

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:14.900
It's not threatening enough.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:28.170
The New York Times, and Time
magazine, and most publications

01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:33.210
have had special
issues on greenness.

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:35.910
In The New York Times issue of--

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:42.270
I can't find the date.

01:03:45.497 --> 01:03:46.600
It doesn't matter.

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:49.950
It's timeless.

01:03:52.950 --> 01:04:01.680
This is a piece written by a
man whose titles his piece "Why

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:02.490
Bother?"

01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:03.380
question mark.

01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:08.750
"Let's say I do bother big time.

01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:11.930
I turn my life upside
down, start biking to work,

01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:15.710
plant a big garden, turn
down the thermostat so low

01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:19.640
I need the Jimmy Carter
signature cardigan,

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:24.860
forsake the clothes dryer for
a laundry line across the yard,

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:29.300
trading the station wagon for
a hybrid, get off the beef,

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.520
get completely local.

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.440
I would theoretically
do all that,

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.590
but what would be the
point when I know full well

01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:40.070
that halfway around the world
there lives my evil twin,

01:04:40.070 --> 01:04:43.220
some carbon footprint
doppelganger

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:48.080
in Shanghai or Chongqing who
has just bought his first car.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:55.280
Chinese car ownership is
where ours was back in 1918.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.470
I forswear and who's
positively itching

01:04:57.470 --> 01:05:00.200
to replace- so
exactly what do I have

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.380
to show for all my trouble?"

01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:06.485
Now, this is an argument
in the developed world.

01:05:06.485 --> 01:05:10.040
This man is writing
from his computer

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:15.260
in New York for one of the
world's leading newspapers

01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:20.990
what to do, contemplating how
minimal his contribution is

01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:23.540
in relation to the
[INAUDIBLE] problem.

01:05:37.904 --> 01:05:47.180
The universality of
climate change and the fact

01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:51.320
that it doesn't
demonstrate itself

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:58.160
in significant physical
form are two problems.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:02.930
In the United
States, there is no--

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.010
when this professor
from Yale is attacked,

01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:12.730
when Rush Limbaugh's
audience, who's

01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:15.720
millions of people
in this country,

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:24.510
argues that Professor Mann
should be punished severely

01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:34.170
physically is a sense of what
conditions occur when society

01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:41.310
wishes to impose its will
for goodness on the economy

01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:45.060
or individually.

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:48.740
Maybe this man who writes
for The New Yorker is wrong.

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:52.050
If all of us did something--

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:56.370
I commute by car to work
every day or every day

01:06:56.370 --> 01:07:01.320
that I work because there's
no public transportation

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:06.030
to account for where I live.

01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:10.290
I would have to walk
a significant distance

01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:11.760
to get a bus.

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:14.700
I would have to change
the bus in Harvard Square.

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:18.570
And I live in the
center of the city.

01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:22.710
[INAUDIBLE] has
taken the trouble

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:25.980
in Los Angeles in
her thesis to take

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:32.220
a trip from one of the poorest
areas by public transportation

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:34.170
to work.

01:07:34.170 --> 01:07:37.190
She took something like an
hour and a half to get to work.

01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:42.700
So we have a problem.

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:47.295
Public transportation is a
function of automobile use.

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.880
This is the world
in which you have

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:59.070
to start working in six
months time or two years time,

01:07:59.070 --> 01:08:01.724
depending on how long you're
still going to be here.

01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:06.130
It's not a pleasant world.

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:24.875
I am as much a bad citizen
as the man in New York City.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:32.069
And yet I morally
proclaim a lot.

01:08:44.810 --> 01:08:49.910
43% of carbon dioxide
production comes

01:08:49.910 --> 01:09:02.220
from buildings, 25%
from industry, and 32%

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.380
from transportation.

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:07.560
The proposal to introduce
congestion pricing

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:12.899
in New York City within the
metropolitan area of New York

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:13.649
failed.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:16.140
Why?

01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:17.580
Because of democracy.

01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:27.300
As long as people in rural
areas have significant votes

01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:34.890
in situations which largely
are urban in character,

01:09:34.890 --> 01:09:36.990
there will be this disjunction.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.100
Road congestion
pricing in London,

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:47.630
which was accepted largely
because they had the best

01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:56.440
public transportation system in
the world, as [INAUDIBLE] said,

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.950
failed when Ken
Livingstone, the mayor,

01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:05.770
proposed attempt
to charge people

01:10:05.770 --> 01:10:09.550
by the amount of carbon
dioxide the automobiles

01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:10.795
or the vehicles produced.

01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:17.685
Specialized congestion
pricing failed in London.

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:28.580
Congesting pricing has been
able to be imposed in societies

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:33.500
which have very strict
allegiances to the states,

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:39.935
such as Singapore, and will
become much more common.

01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:48.760
I expect congestion
pricing to become

01:10:48.760 --> 01:11:00.000
a phenomenon of modern
China, but have a slow advent

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.630
in the United States.

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:04.610
Just look at some
of these images.

01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:12.510
On the left is a typical
proposition of mixed use

01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:16.080
growth in American inner suburb.

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:21.900
"Steady on Judas," the phone
is ringing at the Last Supper.

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:25.410
And Botticelli's
Primavera painting--

01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:28.220
"he wants a word in
your shell-like."

01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:28.720
Next.

01:11:32.710 --> 01:11:41.550
One of the attempts to
improve the monumental quality

01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:45.630
of the freeway on
the left is a project

01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:52.620
to change the shape of
the intersection in Italy,

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:58.590
a rather glamorous and
attractive infrastructure

01:11:58.590 --> 01:11:59.280
change.

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:04.980
Next-- the proposition
which I mentioned

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:08.280
on Tuesday, which
we looked at at MIT

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:16.320
for the introduction of small
vehicles, which could operate

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:21.060
on the distributed system which
would be where the arrow points

01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:25.590
to and also could transfer
to a line-haul system.

01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:31.290
And it's an attempt to
design a interchange

01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:38.740
to take the vehicle from the its
resistance, its temporary use

01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:41.890
on the line-haul and
its circularly use

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:44.610
in the distributed system.

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:47.745
It's never been applied.

01:12:47.745 --> 01:12:48.245
Next.

01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:59.150
This is from the project
of Christopher Alexander.

01:12:59.150 --> 01:13:02.450
"Every dwelling must be
immediately next to a vehicular

01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:05.720
through--" This is
the maximization

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:08.750
of face-to-face contact.

01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:12.500
"Each dwelling must contain
a transparent communal room

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.420
with the following properties.

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:16.490
On the one side,
the room is directly

01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:18.290
adjacent to the street.

01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:20.690
On the opposite side,
the room is directly

01:13:20.690 --> 01:13:23.340
adjacent" to something else.

01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:29.660
So all rooms in houses in this
project face onto the street.

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:31.610
And they are transparent.

01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:38.840
And the road system is
on a number of planes

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:46.280
in order to maintain this
notion of actual and symbolic

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.980
face-to-face relationships.

01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:54.600
Of course, it's
foolish in a silly.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:14:04.840
But next, these are two sitcoms.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:07.810
On the left is The
Brady Bunch, which

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:16.270
produced 117 episodes between
1960 and 1970-something.

01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:20.690
It depicts urban condition.

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:27.400
This was their house, which
could have three, six children.

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:30.400
In suburbia, there
was no conflict

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.410
with the outside world.

01:14:32.410 --> 01:14:34.480
You spread yourself.

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:38.290
This is a divorced husband
who was an architect.

01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:41.860
His wife Carol had
three daughters.

01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:43.720
He had three sons.

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:47.500
And the lady next to
Carol is the housekeeper.

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:52.720
This is the tranquil
American suburban situation.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:55.990
I can read you some of
the episode stories.

01:14:55.990 --> 01:15:00.670
They deal with personal
conflict growing up,

01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:03.430
how to live in a
family, what to do

01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:09.810
when somebody, one of the
children, is nasty and so on.

01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:18.760
On the right is a subsequent
television sitcom called

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:20.890
Diff'rent Strokes.

01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:24.910
I don't know if any of
you have seen these.

01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:29.680
Diff'rent Strokes deals with
a man, a wealthy white man,

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:33.940
an aged man, whose wife died.

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:37.190
He adopts two black kids.

01:15:37.190 --> 01:15:43.540
He has a natural born
daughter who's standing there.

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:50.230
The topics, the situation,
is in downtown American site.

01:15:50.230 --> 01:15:54.030
The topics deal with
drugs, warning children

01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:56.530
not to be attracted
in the street

01:15:56.530 --> 01:16:05.900
by strangers, sexuality,
urban conditions.

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:07.870
They are two images
of the American,

01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:11.950
the center of American
city and the good life

01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:17.860
in the American suburb, which
is, of course, not attainable

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:19.695
for all of these happy people.

01:16:23.850 --> 01:16:27.870
Somebody should write a piece
about the contrast between.

01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:30.870
Ricardo, you should
take these two up

01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:35.790
and indicate what they say about
American metropolitan life.

01:16:39.710 --> 01:16:42.250
Who influences the ideas?

01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:45.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] in Mexico.

01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:46.090
JULIAN BEINART: Sorry?

01:16:46.090 --> 01:16:48.350
AUDIENCE: I can give you a few
romantic examples in Mexico.

01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:49.225
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

01:16:49.225 --> 01:16:54.403
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:54.403 --> 01:16:55.820
JULIAN BEINART:
These fascinate me

01:16:55.820 --> 01:17:02.550
because they're created by
people who know America.

01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:07.520
They're very interesting.

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:11.300
I mean, I had a
friend in Hollywood

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:16.110
who got me a site plan of
the set for The Brady Bunch.

01:17:19.330 --> 01:17:22.260
I was going to write about
these two, but I never did.

01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:22.760
Next.

01:17:26.050 --> 01:17:33.070
Bill Mitchell's
attempt to denote

01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:38.530
in a number of categories public
space retail transactions.

01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:46.210
The category above is go there
same time, go there different

01:17:46.210 --> 01:17:52.510
times, connect remotely, same
time and different times.

01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:59.590
He's trying to indicate
what the space is where

01:17:59.590 --> 01:18:06.490
we use face-to-face
communication and space which

01:18:06.490 --> 01:18:08.710
can be connected remotely.

01:18:08.710 --> 01:18:11.425
Next.

01:18:11.425 --> 01:18:13.655
He talks the same in work.

01:18:18.130 --> 01:18:21.970
The education--
classroom, lecture hall,

01:18:21.970 --> 01:18:26.710
teaching laboratory,
design studio as opposed

01:18:26.710 --> 01:18:29.830
to live broadcast,
videoconferencing class,

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:34.330
shared interactive
environments, Simnet.

01:18:34.330 --> 01:18:36.460
Different times--
non-circulating

01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:40.460
library, museum, language
laboratory and so on.

01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:40.960
Next.

01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:50.900
This is a project in Fort Worth,
Texas, which is essentially

01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:53.360
a metropolitan project.

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:59.720
It's for Alliance Airport,
the first and only

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:03.290
passenger-free
airport in the world.

01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:05.810
It's an intersection in
the metropolitan area

01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:11.960
of Fort Worth of the
Highway 35, which

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:17.180
runs all the way from Mexico
to Canada, the Santa Fe

01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:24.710
railroad which connects
Texas to the Pacific Ocean.

01:19:24.710 --> 01:19:25.210
Next.

01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:36.070
An airport which the
Perot group managed

01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:42.470
to get done politically--

01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:46.760
on the brilliant
idea that congestion

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:53.360
of goods when associated
with passengers

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:59.720
makes transportation of goods
very difficult. And next.

01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:07.540
This is the American
Airlines' largest repair

01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:10.960
facility in the world.

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:16.570
Federal Express chose
Alliance Airport as its--

01:20:16.570 --> 01:20:19.345
after central
headquarters in Memphis.

01:20:21.865 --> 01:20:22.365
Next.

01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:34.380
I show this project not
because I worked on it,

01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:41.590
but because it's one of
the few positive things

01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:47.340
that could be produced in
a metropolitan frame taking

01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:56.480
advantages of rail,
air, and train.

01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:01.570
Instead, what we
now do in Boston

01:21:01.570 --> 01:21:07.510
is schlep high octane
gas across the harbor

01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:10.760
to the embankments in Chelsea.

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:19.450
This would reduce the friction
of that kind of communication

01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:23.860
by locating facilities,
new kinds of facilities

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:28.290
such as transportation
or such as goods only.

01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:33.670
You cannot send
goods electronically.

01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:42.990
I was at a conference
in Euro Disney in Paris

01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:47.700
once where a physicist
from British Telecom

01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:52.950
argued that he foresaw a future
in which physical goods would

01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:56.310
be able to be
dematerialized, sent

01:21:56.310 --> 01:22:00.120
electronically, and
reassembled at the other end.

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:04.140
That will wait for
your generation.

01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:08.280
I don't see the
physics being easy.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:13.890
But this notion of
using transportation

01:22:13.890 --> 01:22:16.890
where it works
well, where it can

01:22:16.890 --> 01:22:22.230
connect in multimodal
possibilities,

01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:23.310
is what Alliance.

01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:27.900
And Alliance has
been very successful

01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:31.600
partly because it's
been so well-designed.

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:37.650
It's got Texas steers on the
landscape next to the runways,

01:22:37.650 --> 01:22:39.480
not in the way of the planes.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:48.400
But it paid a lot of money to
making it a beautiful place.

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:54.070
It has rules for what
these industries can build,

01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:58.850
and it's attracted anomalous
number of good clients.

01:22:58.850 --> 01:23:00.160
OK.

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:06.160
We'll deal with the rest of
the world on next Tuesday.

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.280
Have a good weekend.
