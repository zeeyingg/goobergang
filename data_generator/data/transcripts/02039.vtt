00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.370
PROFESSOR: In most of our
calculations of safety,

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.490
we're going to be interested
in the steady state

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.240
average transmission rate
between individuals in a room,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.570
after the aerosol particles
have built up to a steady state.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.650
But let's briefly talk
about the transient buildup,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.720
and how to take
that into account,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.580
just as an aside
in this board here.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.430
So here is the
general expression

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.770
for the transmission
rate that we describe,

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.980
which depends on the
breathing rate squared,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.240
the volume of the room.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.580
It's an integral over
all the different drop

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.710
sizes, where NQ is a
lumped distribution

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.670
of the number of infection
quanta per volume per radius.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.580
And then PM is the mass
transmission factor,

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.930
which depends on radius.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.450
And lambda C is the
total relaxation rate

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.840
involving sedimentation
or settling and viral

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.160
deactivation and filtration.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.289
And that also depends,
of course, on R.

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.820
And that lambda C of R also
ends up in the exponent here.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.710
So that actually, that
rate of relaxation

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.230
of the concentration
in the air, is also

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.410
setting the time scale,
lambda C inverse,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.140
for the buildup of those
aerosol droplets in the air.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.539
And so that's this factor here.

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.509
This is basically the
transient term is this term.

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.820
And then this term, the
one, is the steady term.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.460
So we're interested now what's
the effect of the transient.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.580
Now, before we get to that, if
we forget about the transient

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.600
now, and we just have
the steady state,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.620
then we introduce
beta bar as the sort

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.890
of constant steady state
value transmission.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.270
And through this definition
here, by doing these integrals,

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.850
we have defined an
effective radius R bar,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.380
which is sort of where you
evaluate the mass transmission

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.250
factor, and also the
filtration-- or the relaxation

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.760
rate in order to make
these two values equal.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.340
So that's actually our
definition of effective radius.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.630
And so now, looking
at the transient term,

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.150
let's ask ourselves, what
is the average transmission

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.060
rate up to a certain time tau.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.030
So that would be, we
divide by a time tau,

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.329
and we ask ourselves
up to that time,

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.710
what is the average
transmission rate?

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.540
So we integrate beta dT from
0 to tau, then divide by tau.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.800
So what would that be?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.740
Well, we can take
this time integral

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.040
and bring it inside
the radius integral,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.300
and write this as QB
squared over B integral 0

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.400
to infinity of PM
squared NQ of lambda C.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.840
Keep in mind all those
factors depend on R. Times,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.830
now, an integral from 0 to tau--

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.700
so I'll put this in brackets--

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.910
of 1 minus e to the minus
lambda C, which depends on R,

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:28.670
times T divided by
divided by tau dT.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.810
And then dR.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.150
So switching the order of
integration, where we're going

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.690
to do the time integral first.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.050
And so what we have here,
if we just look only

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.020
at this expression
right here, we

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.530
can write this as a sum
of a steady state term.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.950
So when it's just 1, this is
the integral 1 over tau from 0

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.990
to tau, so that's just 1.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.579
So that's the steady
state contribution.

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.460
1 plus, and there's a
transient contribution where I

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.270
have to do this integral here.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.250
So that's e to the
minus lambda C of T

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:13.930
over lambda C tau,
evaluated from 0 to tau.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.490
And so we'll come back
to this in just a moment

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.370
and evaluate that.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.140
But just to draw a
picture maybe first

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.820
of what we're looking at here.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.910
The average transmission rate
as a function of this averaging

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.250
time tau, well,
eventually of course,

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.130
it tends to the
steady state value.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.740
But it does so in a certain
way we're going to calculate,

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.030
like that, where the time
for that transmission--

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.810
or for that transition, is the
inverse of the relaxation time.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.790
Although there's not a
precise value of that.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.260
But if we want to keep
actually a scale for it,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.200
it's going to be evaluate at that
value R bar that I mentioned.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.500
That gives you a rough sense
of the overall relaxation.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.470
So this build up of the aerosol
concentration in the room

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.060
once the infected
person has entered,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.470
and eventually, there's sort
of a steady transmission rate

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.130
to everyone else in the room.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.360
So let's continue calculating
this right here now.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.590
So this is the transient.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.660
And I can write this as 1.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.040
And if I evaluate here, I can
put it this way, as minus,

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.830
and then I evaluate first at
the lower limit, which gives me

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.710
another 1, minus,
and then evaluating

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.290
at the upper limit, which is
tau, e to the minus lambda

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:43.380
C tau over lambda C tau.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.520
And now, I'll use
an approximation

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.670
that helps me get a
simple analytical results.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.090
So I should mention,
as soon as we

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.310
have exponential and
polynomial factors,

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.800
it can be difficult
to solve equations.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.610
For example, what is the
bound on the occupancy

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.100
or the time in the room,
or the ventilation.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.330
We like to get a simple formula.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.980
And so if there's a nice
approximation I can make,

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:15.210
which is that 1 minus
e to the minus x over x

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:22.030
is not too far off from 1
over 1 plus x, it turns out.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.470
So it's not a perfect match.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.350
You can try plotting
these two functions.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.780
But it's a reasonable
approximation,

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.390
given that everything we're
doing in this calculation,

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.890
when applied to
a real situation,

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.100
is going to be off by
some uncertainty, which

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.010
could be a factor of 2
or 3, this is actually

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.420
going to be more
than good enough

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.320
of an approximation for us.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.780
So if I make that approximation,
then what I have here

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:54.240
is that this thing is
1 over 1 plus x here.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:01.890
And so we end up with 1 minus
1 over 1 plus lambda C tau.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.930
And when I combine
those two terms,

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:12.840
I end up with lambda C tau
over 1 plus lambda C tau.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.480
So this is my approximation.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.340
In fact, I can
further then write

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:24.030
that as 1 over 1 plus
lambda C tau inverse,

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:28.140
dividing the numerator and
denominator by lambda C tau.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.060
So I'm just making some
approximations here

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.960
that allow me to get a
very simple expression

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.690
in the end for my
safety guideline,

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:41.180
taking into account this
transient build up here.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.340
So remember that
the bound we have

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.550
is on the indoor
reproductive number, which

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:57.600
is N minus 1 times the
integral to tau of beta dT.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.710
So what is that?

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:03.960
That's just the sort of
time average beta times tau.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.590
So this bound is
actually N minus 1,

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.800
time average beta times tau.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.680
And then our
guideline, of course,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:17.130
is to make this less than
our tolerance, epsilon.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.070
And so what that means
then is using this result,

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.790
you can see that I
just get the rest--

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.030
so if I look at the
expression for beta bracket,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.910
it's just the steady state
expression times this factor.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.240
So basically, this is
kind of the factor that

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.669
corrects for transient effects.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:38.770
Again, with just a
simple approximation.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.309
So I can then write
that my guideline now

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:46.390
has a modified form, which
is that N minus 1 times tau

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:51.150
is less than epsilon
over the time average

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.370
beta up to time tau.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.250
And this is approximately
equal to epsilon over

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.120
beta steady state
times this factor here.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:05.880
If I multiply that to the
other side, I just get 1 plus 1

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.970
over lambda C of R bar tau.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:22.520
So basically, this right here
is the transient correction,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.040
or modification.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:29.710
And this is the
steady state formula,

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.360
which we will more
typically be using.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.960
Now, why do we care
about the transient?

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.200
Well, first of all, you can see
that by using the transient,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.900
we are being less conservative.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.490
So if we want to be
very conservative,

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:43.900
we can say, you know
what, let's just

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.010
assume the second that
the infected person enters

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.250
the room, boom,
the transition rate

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.060
goes right to the maximum value.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.310
That's the most conservative.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:58.050
So generally, using the steady
state is more conservative.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.760
So that's one reason
we like to use it.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.430
Also, it gives you
a simpler formula.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.180
Why add a bunch of
factors to a formula that

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.920
only make it less conservative.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.560
And we've made a lot of
assumptions in this model,

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.240
so it makes sense, maybe
let's not worry about it.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.180
However, I do actually
like to include it

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.030
for certain examples,
because it allows

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.340
you to capture the
intuition we all have

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.550
that when the time goes
to 0, the risk also

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.590
has to go to 0, which you
don't get from a steady state.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.140
If this bumps up
right away, then you

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.420
could be spending like
2 seconds in a room,

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.140
and you have a chance of getting
infected right away, which

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.130
is actually not right.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.770
There has to be some time
physically for transmission

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.930
to happen through these droplets
from one person to another.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.560
So the effect of the transient
correction, as you can see here

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.570
is, when lambda C tau
is larger than 1--

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.060
so that's times that are kind
of out here-- that term is gone.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.410
But when you get to these
earlier times, or very short

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.040
times, where there
hasn't been time yet

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.810
for the build up of the airborne
concentration, then as you see,

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.480
as tau goes is 0 actually,
this term diverges.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.120
So what actually happens
is that if I calculate sort

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.930
of, for example, one thing you
can get from this guideline

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:18.840
is what is the sort of maximum
occupancy, or versus time.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.180
Or it's sort of the maximum
time in the room for a given

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:21.810
occupancy.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:25.240
We're going to be looking
at lots of plots like this.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:30.450
I would have something
that might look like this

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.430
for steady transmission.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:41.100
And when this time
gets larger then lambda

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.000
C of R bar inverse--

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.630
there's some critical
time scale there,

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.190
which is this one right here--

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.450
then when you're
past that time scale,

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.610
you've got the steady state.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.100
But if you go to smaller times,
then what happens at this thing

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.670
can sort of blow
up a lot faster.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.770
So what it kind of
helps to capture

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.930
is, again, this intuition
that if I put in like tau

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.250
is extremely small, then of
course, the risk goes away,

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.500
and I can have larger numbers
of people in the room,

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.370
or I can tolerate smaller
times and actually be safe.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:15.250
So anyway, that's one
reason we do that.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.250
On the other hand, for a
conservative guideline,

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.170
and the most important
message of this course,

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.170
really, is to think about
that steady state transmission

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:23.820
rate, which we will
mainly be focusing

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.910
on in all of our examples.
