00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.194
JULIAN BEINART: We'll focus
on the third and fourth case

00:00:32.194 --> 00:00:32.694
study.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.870
These case studies which
were concluded on Thursday

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:46.610
with Chicago are
all examples of what

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.640
19th century urbanism or
more premodern urbanism

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.810
contended with.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.270
They all contended more or less
with similar circumstances--

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:07.410
the rise of industrial
poverty, the weakening

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:14.220
of the aristocracy and the
royal presence, in some cases

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.780
the existence of walls
or fortification,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.210
which is becoming redundant.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.460
Chicago is very different.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.825
Chicago has no royalty,
no autocracy, no walls.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.880
So Thursday we will look
at Chicago comparatively.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.960
Today, I want to look at two
case studies, one of Vienna,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.125
which has a great
deal to do with walls.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.340
And the second is
Barcelona, which

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.120
we're going to focus on the
most common emancipation

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.240
in the 19th century from
some of these problems.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.670
That is to leave
the center of city

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.410
alone and build on
new land outside.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.350
Cerda's plan for Barcelona is
the largest planned housing

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.410
project in the world.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.400
Certainly the largest
housing project in Europe.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.550
Let's start with Vienna.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.850
Vienna was the major bastion.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.090
Well, let me try to
explain what I gave you.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.000
The first diagram is the
replacement of the walls

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.560
and the various sectors of
the continuous 2 and 1/2

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.080
mile road, which
became the urban symbol

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.940
of the post-feudal city.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:11.450
The second is innovation
of Karl Marx-Hof, which

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.600
is this, an element in the
third stage of the city

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.030
from the feudal city,
to the liberal city,

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.790
to the socialist
city for a relatively

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.400
short time from 1919 onward.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.940
The next page is the ensanche
of that part of Barcelona

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:44.960
which is based on the 1859
plan of Ildefons Cerda

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.550
is called the ensanche.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.675
You can see the extended
pattern of the similar block.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.160
The next page are the
two [? completely ?]

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.240
winning two finalists
in the competition.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.580
Cerda's plan on the north.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.040
The print is a little obscured,
and the alternative plan,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.470
Antoni Rovira i Trias's plan.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.239
We'll discuss this
in some detail.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.850
The next page is an
element of Cerda's plan.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.060
[? He erected ?] the same
square block, 113 meters by 113

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.720
meters, with options
for development

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.370
to create a flexible
environment in which

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:53.030
only a portion of
the block is built.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.700
And lastly, the town in
Apulia in Southern Italy

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:08.000
showing the conventional plan,
which exists in smaller towns,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.520
maintaining the central area,
developing a grid system

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.500
outside the central area
connected to the central area

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.975
by the gates of the walls.

00:05:23.735 --> 00:05:24.235
OK.

00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:29.965
Vienna.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.470
Who threatened Vienna
from the 16th century

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.162
to the 17th century?

00:05:44.162 --> 00:05:45.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.940
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.160
Islam focused its
threat on the West.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.450
I'm forgetting about Islam
in North Africa and Spain,

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:04.980
but in Central Europe,
Islam made to major attacks

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.300
on Vienna.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.270
1529.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:15.010
They were repelled, causing
the building of walls,

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:20.030
enormous wall system, 20
years later in Vienna,

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.910
a wall system which had
11 bastions, a moat,

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.550
and an area called the
glacis, G-L-A-C-I-S.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.580
It refers to the open space
around the walls to create

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:43.740
an arena for military
firepower, gun firepower.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.350
You understand the concept.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.340
So you have not only
the walls, but you

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.600
have a span of free
space like a green belt

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.150
around the walls, which
enables improved fortification.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:06.920
These walls were subjected to
another major larger attack

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:14.210
by Islam in 1683, in
which case for two months

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.720
Vienna was on its last legs.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.970
They managed to
subvert [? them ?]

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:25.100
by tunneling under the
walls, breaking through

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:31.580
from the south, and Vienna
was within a morning

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.740
of collapsing when
all of the forces

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.390
galvanized by the pope
in Rome to the extent

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:49.220
that he still had
support couldn't deflect

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.350
the energy of the Islam attack.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.990
An extraordinary
event in history.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:04.040
The Polish Catholic King
of Poland, John Sobieski,

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.390
had refused to take part
in the defense of Vienna

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.060
for reasons I don't know.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.900
The last morning, Vienna had
already being penetrated.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.170
The old city had been
virtually-- either

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.170
all the people had
been killed or left.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:26.150
Sobieski decided to send
his cavalry south to Vienna.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:31.370
They arrived, and Islam
had concentrated its attack

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.530
on the south of the city.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:37.700
It didn't expect any
attack from the north,

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.370
so it was completely
vulnerable in the north.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.715
Sobieski saved Vienna
in one morning.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:51.350
There's a wonderful book on the
story of this whole episode.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.888
If you're interested
in the book, tell me

00:08:54.888 --> 00:08:56.055
and I'll give you the title.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:08.060
It's an extraordinary idea of
the scale of an Islamic attack,

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:15.320
the organization in Istanbul
of the army, and all the food,

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.850
and all of the prostitutes
that accompanied

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.765
the army as they moved
through Hungary to Vienna.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:32.690
That is one of the signal events
in the urban history of Europe.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:38.240
Had Islam succeeded,
there might have been no--

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.230
I don't know.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.480
Certainly probably no Freud.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:55.890
Perhaps no Beethoven, Mozart,
and Haydn, et cetera, et

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.280
cetera.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:03.770
I don't know how to claim
Islam's contribution

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.660
had it captured Vienna.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.150
I don't know what
would have happened

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:13.100
to Europe, but Vienna was the
fourth largest city in Europe--

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.080
Vienna, London, Paris, Berlin--

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:25.010
and in many respects,
certainly in the last years

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:32.360
of the 19th century, one of
the major artistic centers

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.725
of European culture.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.930
What year do you
think Brahms died?

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:45.605
Take a guess.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:56.990
Brahms was born in about 1830.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:01.670
He died in 1897,
as late as that.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:06.350
He was the tutor of the
philosopher Wittgenstein's

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.810
sister.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.940
Taught him the piano.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:16.880
Gustav Mahler played music
in the Wittgensteins' houses.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:22.820
The Wittgenstein family owned
12 houses in Vienna itself.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.970
Wittgenstein-- do
you know anything

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.510
about the history of
modern philosophy?

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.990
Wittgenstein is one of the--

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.120
Bertrand Russell, the
British philosopher,

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.510
called him the greatest
philosophical genius

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.450
who ever lived.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.280
He was interested in
architecture, and he had his--

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.630
oh, forget about that.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.360
It's off on a tangent.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:56.000
But Ludwig Wittgenstein
is an art product

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.440
of the culture of Vienna.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:11.610
So we have a setting in which
Vienna survives in 1683.

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:18.270
Royal presence maintains
itself until about 1860,

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.960
in which the liberals
win in the government,

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:27.580
take over the government, and
start a process of modernizing

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.080
the city.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.420
What I didn't mention in the
case of Haussmann in Paris

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.520
was the number of
things that Haussmann

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:49.430
did in the provision of parks,
open space, unifying the bus

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:53.270
system, improving
the infrastructure

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.860
of the city as a whole.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:57.560
Other than the building
of these roads,

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.880
he's known only for the
avenues that he built,

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.900
the housing that he built on
either side of the avenues,

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.410
and for the major monuments.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.830
But at the same time,
he built a repertoire

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.440
of infrastructure improvements.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:20.630
The same year, the Danube
constantly flooded the city.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:24.750
The city's always been on the
southern part of the Danube.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.360
The walls were on the--

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.470
as you can see.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:39.490
Today, the Danube fringes
the northern boundary

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:44.650
of the southern city by a canal.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:48.820
The water flooding
problem was bypassed,

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:54.340
and in the same sense--

00:13:54.340 --> 00:14:01.860
at the same time,
there was improvements

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.940
in the health system, the
first public hospital,

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.120
and a whole set of
improvements, but nothing

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:18.150
as major as the decision to
isolate the center of the city

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.930
and to build a new environment.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.930
Instead of the new
environment being

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:29.850
similar to the plan of
Cerda for Barcelona,

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:33.900
he took the
extraordinary opportunity

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:39.330
for using the glacis and
the remnants of the walls

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:45.000
to build a single container
around the outskirts

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.340
of the old city.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:53.190
This was a container
in which almost

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:59.040
all the sectors of a
new middle-class economy

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.780
could be satisfied.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:05.700
Number one, from the diagram--

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.900
textile warehouses and
offices on the Danube canal.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:14.460
Number two, financial center
on the Stock Exchange.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.680
Number three, a university.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.580
Number four, the
famous connection

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.420
of the parliament, the town
hall, the president's palace.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:28.800
Number five, museums, number
six, music, number seven,

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.150
private apartments.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:42.160
Nowhere in the connected
structure of urbanism

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.670
has there ever been
an attempt to build

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:50.020
one continuous movement
system accompanied

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.920
by surroundings as
diverse as making up

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.200
virtually the components
of a whole city.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:04.520
It's a dramatic idea,
an incredible idea.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.760
It had many of its
manifestations.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.980
First of all, the
buildings are not

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:16.400
oriented to each other but
oriented to the street.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.500
The street is everything
that animates the performance

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.880
of the buildings on its sides.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:17:04.720
Secondly, instead
of as in England,

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:10.329
every effort was made to connect
the space beyond the old city

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.970
with its center city.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:20.220
In this case, the old city
was where workers lived

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.780
and-- sorry, not the old city.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:27.060
This is the old city,
where people were poor,

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:31.440
where there were factories,
where hygiene was

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.770
unclean and untaken care of.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:56.230
[INAUDIBLE] from here to
here is equivalent in size

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.150
to the whole city.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:59.090
To the old city.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.590
Sorry.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.020
I'm talking badly this morning.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.360
To the old city.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:10.150
So you've constructed a
new city along one line

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:11.760
2 and 1/2 miles long.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.700
It should come therefore
as no surprise that in 1919

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:34.470
when socialists
took over the city

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.550
that they would concentrate
their efforts in the area

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.100
beyond the Ringstrasse.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.880
Karl Marx-Hof-- we took a
look at in a little detail--

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.710
exists outside of the ring.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:55.740
The ring didn't contain the
elements of the feudal city.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.520
Since Stephen's Church was
not replaced in the ring,

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.200
the vote of church in the
ring is simply a thanksgiving

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.470
for Vienna's victories.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:14.070
The royal palace
ensemble, which is

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.670
a large part of the
old city, attempted

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.760
to penetrate onto the ring.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.300
Gottfried Semper did a
plan for the extension

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:32.220
of the royal palace site to the
ring, which has sort of softly

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.980
connected but not.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.110
The presence on the
ring is everything

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.360
to do with a
middle-class economy.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:56.830
It's the classic example
of a road space dominating

00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:00.370
everything that surrounds it.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.610
In a few minutes time when--

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.650
towards the end of
our story, then I

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:22.840
will concentrate on the
difference between proponents

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:28.210
of archaism like Camillo
Sitte and Otto Wagner,

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:29.410
the great modernist.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:42.760
It's interesting, though, Wagner
the modernist was fascinated

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.040
by the possibility
that one could move

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:50.110
along a street and the street
could be there primarily

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:55.060
because it supports the
significant phenomenon

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.790
of movement.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:01.540
The buildings on the
side of the street

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.080
had no unifying architecture.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:05.815
In the complex--

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.200
I'll quote you from somebody
who liked the complex, which

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:18.270
is the city hall, the theater,
the university, and parliament.

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:25.260
I quote-- I ran from one
object of interest to another.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.050
For hours, I would
gaze at the parliament.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:31.170
The whole ring
boulevard seemed to me

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:35.610
like an enchantment
from the 1,001 nights.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:36.450
Who was this?

00:21:40.671 --> 00:21:43.460
He became a significant
figure in history.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.362
Even you might know who he is.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.132
Adolf Hitler.

00:21:50.132 --> 00:21:52.880
He wanted to study
architecture in Vienna,

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.830
and they wouldn't let him.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:55.779
Pity.

00:21:55.779 --> 00:21:59.272
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:12.690
There was something
about this complex which

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.910
exemplifies the interest in--

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.600
not the interest
in, but the fact

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.500
that there was no consuming
architectural style

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.960
which could unify a street.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:32.920
For instance, in this complex,
expression then was used.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:38.140
The town hall is compared
to a free medieval commune

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.930
and is built in Gothic style.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:46.960
The theater exemplifies
the aesthetic enthusiasm

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.200
and is therefore given
the Baroque style.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.160
The university is the symbol
of enlightened culture.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.530
It's given the
Renaissance style.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.840
Parliament is democracy.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.290
It's given the Greek style.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:07.570
We did some work in
Bratislava in Slovakia.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:12.280
Bratislava and Vienna are
the two closest capitals

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.660
in the world of
neighboring countries.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:23.230
We had meetings with the
deputy mayor of Vienna, who is

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:25.445
the chief of Vienna's planning.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:35.080
To find his office in
this Gothic construction,

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:43.708
this large Gothic construction,
takes almost a supporting dog.

00:23:43.708 --> 00:23:45.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:51.190
It is still an
amazing construction.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:24:01.960
Camillo Sitte archaism
was to counter

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:06.700
the flow of continuous
movement in cities.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:15.940
For him, he would break up the
continuity by creating plazas,

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.480
had significant intervals
along the street.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.130
I'll show you a slide for his
proposal for one of the plazas.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:33.520
There was no such
enthusiasm for curtailing

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:39.050
the emphasis of this
middle-class continuity.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:59.120
I'll just-- imagine
choosing to build buildings

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.970
according to an image of
the essential performance

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:10.520
and therefore to choose
the historical style which

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.010
supports that.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.845
I can't think of it
being done anywhere else.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:22.760
By concentrating on
the power of a street,

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.940
perhaps it frees you from any--

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.540
it allows you to
accept any device

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:33.120
to create the
architecture along it.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.820
There's something about
a system of streets,

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:41.900
a simple system of
public ways which

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.020
may enable the
environment or which

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:52.720
supports it to be free of having
to perform those functions,

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.060
a continuous facade functions.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.380
It's a thought which
strikes me from Vienna.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:13.170
If you allowed Zaha
Hadid to build in Vienna

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:15.900
in the old city of
Vienna, at least

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.840
you'd have the
Ringstrasse to hold you

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.430
into some public format.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.080
The trouble with the new Vienna
on the north side of the river

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:33.120
is that it has no armature
either of the old city

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.160
or of the ring structure
to hold it together.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:41.610
You have buildings which the
entrances to the buildings

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.950
are unidentifiable.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:48.210
It is the biggest load of
garbage I've ever seen,

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:50.760
done by some of Europe's
great architects.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.490
This organization in
the ring structure

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:02.050
of buildings knowing and
showing where you enter them--

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:06.970
this is true of all of the
buildings of the old city.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:11.090
There's a logic to
where a street is--

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:15.760
that the street is public,
that once you leave the street

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:21.300
you are directed by a building
[INAUDIBLE] performance.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:29.350
It's a powerful conjunction.

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:33.140
The Ringstrasse is
about 200 feet wide,

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.940
which is about the width
of Commonwealth Avenue,

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:37.570
if I remember.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:54.630
The housing on both
on the Ringstrasse

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.160
was private housing.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:01.290
Again, the tradition of the
middle class emulating formally

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:10.170
the facade idea of
the royalty occurs.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:14.550
I will show you slides of
the facades of something

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:17.020
called a [INAUDIBLE] house.

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.230
This is a condominium building.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:23.280
The lots were large, and
the accumulated building

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.460
of a kind which we
now to accept is

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:33.630
common was accepted as the mode.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:42.780
The financing of the
Ringstrasse was largely state,

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:47.460
but also the land was free.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:52.050
So when it-- because of
the glacis and the walls

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:55.240
belonged to nobody
but the state.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:03.390
So the money made in privatizing
the parts of the Ringstrasse

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:07.980
for housing or offices
meant a return of income

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.850
to the city, which they
could use for parks

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:14.340
and other public facilities.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:26.370
It's interesting that throughout
the formal agenda of buildings

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:29.760
in the various cities,
from the feudal city

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.960
to the Ringstrasse of the
city to the socialist city,

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.060
certain archetypal ideas--

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:40.050
for instance Karl Marx-Hof
has sculpture on the facade.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.220
There's flags on the facade.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:50.250
This is a Marxist
socialist environment,

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:55.230
which still pays tribute
to the Royal appurtenances.

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:59.790
There's a strong sense of the
need to maintain continuity

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:03.120
throughout the history
of this modern city,

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:11.770
or certainly from 1860 onward.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:17.350
A few words about
archaism versus modernism.

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:23.865
Camillo Sitte was an
architect and critic

00:30:23.865 --> 00:30:27.580
who wrote a book which
had a lot of influence.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:37.770
He was against the evident
preoccupation of modernism

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:42.780
with economic progress,
with speed, with fluidity,

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:48.270
with movement against
the rationalization

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:51.750
of traffic, and hygiene,
and the technology

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:56.610
which is appropriate for
that kind of performance.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:58.410
He was much more
interested in the world

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:01.800
of the artisan, the
world of the guilds,

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.740
much like [? Raskin ?]
perhaps in London.

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:09.810
He was attracted by
the labor quality

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:17.790
of the guild, the disappearance
of the guild and the artisan.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:23.700
He was a great admirer
of Richard Wagner.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:28.890
He was fascinated by
[INAUDIBLE] [? work, ?]

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:33.165
the idea of bringing a genuine
folk art to bear on the city.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:47.520
For him, the Ringstrasse, which
was a continuous open space,

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:57.200
was a form of
enclosure which was

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:03.620
antithetical to his view
of what a city needed.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:10.220
A city needed places, public
enclosure, continuity,

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:15.710
understanding, a kind of
psychometric condition

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.860
in which everything
which was close to you

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.810
would fit to your emotional.

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:23.390
So if you saw a
big building, you

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:27.500
would appreciate its bigness
because it had a purpose,

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:32.450
and you had a continuous space,
a public space from which you

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:37.040
could appreciate its
emotional circumstance

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.760
rather than being disrupted
by the continuous flow

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.520
of an open-ended system.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:48.600
Richard Otto Wagner,
on the other hand--

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:55.190
I might point out that Camillo
Sitte was not the only person.

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:58.040
He was an advocate
of the picturesque,

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.790
of the effect of the
emotional, but he

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:08.000
was one of the people who
started worrying about the fact

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:15.500
that city planning in Europe was
[? wissenschaft, ?] was moving

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:21.530
in its representation only of
the two-dimensional surface

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:23.420
of the city.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:27.980
For Sitte, the third
dimension was being excluded.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:32.780
Referring to Baumeister's,
the German books

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.550
on traffic engineering.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:40.430
Baumeister's book of 1876
and Heinrich Steuben's book

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.830
of 1907.

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:46.490
Quote, the traffic systems
and direction of their flow

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:51.800
form the basis of the plan
of construction of cities.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:57.710
So city growth, city
enlargement, city planning

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:05.500
was seen as a two-dimensional
exercise of the organization

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.110
of movement.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:12.460
Wagner was too
sensitive an architect.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:16.389
In fact, he was a kind
of hybrid personality.

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:21.010
The demands of efficiency,
economy, and physics

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:22.550
were attractive to him.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.800
He was a modern man.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.420
He believed the
city could expand,

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.830
and his project for
the expansion of Vienna

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:34.750
are reproductions of
the old city of Vienna,

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:41.800
about 100,000 to 150,000 units
all linked by movement systems.

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:45.400
He spent his time
building buildings

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.210
for the new Danube
canal sluice gates.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:53.710
He did the wonderful
subway stop,

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:57.640
the [? car ?] [? plots ?] and
a number of the subway stops

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.730
in the new Vienna subway system.

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:12.120
At the same time, he designed
neoclassical monuments.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.210
His great [INAUDIBLE]
Vienna should

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:26.820
go to see his small church in
the medical facility, housing

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:31.260
facility in the city.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.140
It's been restored
with a golden dome

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:38.010
and doesn't look like anything
that a modernist would

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.140
have anything to do with.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.180
Perhaps his most
significant building

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:47.070
is the Postal Savings
Bank on the Ringstrasse,

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.130
the only building that he built
on the ring dresser, which

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:54.150
has a rectangular
grid set of windows.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:57.030
But between the grid
of windows, there

00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:02.400
are [? French ?] tiles decorated
with floral decorations,

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.580
sinews, floral decorations.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:33.115
You know, I've said most of
the things that I want to say.

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:47.170
Amongst Otto
Wagner's fascination

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:52.330
was what he called the painless
uncertainty of modernism,

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:59.900
which is an extraordinary kind
of comment that if you pay--

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:04.300
Wagner in my mind was a
brilliantly confused man

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:08.710
at the time of the
intersection of traditionalism

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:09.730
with modernism.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.370
For those of you who want
to study his architecture,

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:17.470
look at the work of
a great architect.

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:24.070
He had an enormous influence
for a number of his students

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:31.210
were involved in the building
of the hofs after 1919.

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:34.270
But the idea of
painless uncertainty,

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:38.680
that one is not going
to be sure about what

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.570
is going to happen over time.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:44.200
In fact, it is
impossible to know what's

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.110
going to happen over
time, and therefore you

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:52.090
have to try to understand
how to deal with uncertainty.

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:57.940
This is the first time that I
think a 19th century architect

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:05.570
or city person makes an
important statement about what

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:10.060
preoccupies a lot of the
thinking in the 20th century

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.070
and still does today--

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:18.850
that is open-mindedness,
diversity, change, and a number

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:22.000
of the associated phenomena.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.060
We'll see in Cerda's
plan for Barcelona

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:30.260
an attempt to allow
for that to take place.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:38.590
But just two other stories.

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:45.880
The post-1919 story.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:51.200
The real estate speculation
after the rebuilding

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:55.640
of the Ringstrasse had resulted
in enormous increases in rent

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.310
for porting housing
conditions for working class.

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:07.690
And the 1917 census showed
that 73% of Vienna housing

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:12.890
was quote, in unspeakable
conditions of overcrowding

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:13.390
and hygiene.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:27.270
Workers were paying 25% of
their income to housing.

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:32.160
In 1919, Vienna
became Red Vienna

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:38.190
with the socialist majority,
and Red Vienna has remained.

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:40.740
There's a book by
Eve Blau at Harvard

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:45.670
on Red Vienna which
is worth looking at,

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:50.250
but this was a time when the
London County Council in London

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:55.995
was established a similar
planning operation in Berlin.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:06.990
From 1919 to 1925, they
invested in a radical policy

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:12.810
of land acquisition,
law controlling rent,

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:16.740
and the building
of new apartments.

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:22.020
By 1934, they had
built 63,700 dwellings,

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:29.610
equivalent to 70% of the entire
production between the wars.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:34.680
Housing was something like a
tenth of the city's population.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.480
There was a
controversy about what

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:41.550
form these new socialist
housing should take place.

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:48.150
Adolf Loos and a number
of other architects

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:52.500
proposed following
the German example

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.840
of the [? siedlungen. ?]
The siedlungen,

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:59.250
but the famous
siedlungen in Stuttgart

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:03.540
and so on were
examples of housing

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:10.410
the poor in green
circumstances with houses

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:15.750
which were single family with
gardens and self-sufficiency

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.210
that deprived from the
center of the city.

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:30.560
Another group of people
felt that it was about time

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.070
that the workers made
their presence felt,

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:38.600
and the way they could
make their presence

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:43.940
felt was to develop a pugnacious
housing response to the market

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:45.140
housing.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:50.660
This took the form of
the hof, H-O-F. "Hof"

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:58.610
is the same word in
German as "court".

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:04.220
So by calling their
housing a court,

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:09.560
they have another reflection
back to the feudal city.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.260
It seems to me that
revolutionists never

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.840
abandon everything.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:18.080
They abandoned the
key variable, or they

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:21.020
destroy the key
variable, the market,

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:25.940
and maintain everything
else of a secondary order.

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:31.100
We look at this when we discuss
the post-revolutionary work

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:40.130
in Russia from 1917,
particularly to 1932,

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:46.280
in the work of the disurbanists,
and urbanists, and others.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:53.442
Karl Marx-Hof of is the
largest of the enterprises.

00:42:53.442 --> 00:42:54.650
There were a number of them--

00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:01.460
[INAUDIBLE],, [? Viessmann ?]
Hof, [INAUDIBLE] Hof,

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.760
[INAUDIBLE] Hof,
[INAUDIBLE] Hof--

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:10.590
built between 1924 and 1927.

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:14.730
Karl Ehn, the architect
for Karl Marx-Hof,

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:18.240
is a rather
undistinguished figure.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.060
He worked in the
city government.

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.200
He had done some housing.

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:32.230
Unfortunately, stayed on and
worked for the Nazis as well,

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:38.010
so maybe his vocabulary
was very widespread.

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:41.730
Karl Marx-Hof was
a pugnacious island

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:48.750
which built apartments,
1,380 apartments,

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:54.630
plus a large interior
space containing nurseries,

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:59.910
collective laundries, library,
offices shops, clinic,

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:00.810
and so on.

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:07.690
This period didn't
last very long,

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:18.300
and Karl Marx-Hof and
Red Vienna remained

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:23.790
as a kind of intellectual
fascination for our urbanists

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:25.650
afterwards.

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:29.220
Karl Marx-Hof is still
worth visiting today.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.800
It's located connected
to the center

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:38.820
of the city by light rail,
by heavy rail, by bus.

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.680
It's easy to get to.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.240
It's extraordinarily large.

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:46.765
Has anybody been to Vienna?

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:52.731
What did you see in Vienna?

00:44:52.731 --> 00:44:54.575
AUDIENCE: Museum [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:54.575 --> 00:44:56.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:57.930
JULIAN BEINART: I
don't blame you.

00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:00.640
Wonderful museum.

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.770
You couldn't go to a
concert, I suppose.

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:04.370
AUDIENCE: No, I just--

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:09.280
JULIAN BEINART: There's no
democracy of tickets in Vienna.

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:14.440
I had to listen to the Vienna
Philharmonic play in Cleveland

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:17.270
because I've always wanted to
hear the Vienna Philharmonic

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.770
play.

00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:22.660
Vienna Philharmonic
didn't include

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:26.620
women in the [INAUDIBLE]
until relatively recently,

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:30.620
so there are a
lot of throwbacks.

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:35.260
Their attitude towards Jews
is signally despicable.

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:38.800
Gustav Mahler who was
born a Jew and a bohemian.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.400
In order to become the
conductor of the Vienna

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.820
[? Philharmonic, ?] he had
become Catholic temporarily so

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:47.860
that he could play music.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.780
Extraordinary stories.

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:55.090
You should go to the
Judenplatz in the old city,

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:57.550
where the Jews were massacred.

00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:01.560
There's a wonderful sculpture
by the British sculptor.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:06.670
A woman-- I forget her name--

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:14.655
built a concrete sculpture
made of books as a remnant.

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:21.990
There's one last
thing about Vienna.

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:31.680
The last 10, 20 years of the
end of that century, Vienna

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.630
underwent one of the
great cultural performance

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:42.960
spans which we associate
with great cities.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:52.350
We associate it with
15th century Florence,

00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:55.500
the great painters, the great
sculptors, the Medici family.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.740
This is a similar
period in the West.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:09.240
We have the transference
from 19th century

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.660
romantic music to modern music.

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:21.480
Brahms died in 1897.

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:28.440
Schoenberg lived from 1874
to 1951, Alban Berg from 1885

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:36.960
to 1935, Anton Webern 1852
to 1945, Gustav Mahler

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:40.680
from 1860 to 1911.

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.840
These were the
people who invented

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:48.480
the post-romantic music for us.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:51.060
You may not like the music.

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:55.800
Amongst them, only Mahlers
are now conventionally played

00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:00.180
by the Boston [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:04.380
Very few people play Schoenberg
except in their living rooms.

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:13.320
[INAUDIBLE] opera is
performed now and then,

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:14.535
Alban Berg's music.

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:21.250
But this the significance
of a city, that it

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:25.390
can transform culture
in significant ways.

00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:28.930
Why it happens in cities--

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:29.780
Austria.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:35.770
Vienna was not it economic
after the separation of the--

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:39.160
no, that took
place-- it was later.

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.650
There are a number of theories
as to why this happened.

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:43.900
Peter Hall, the
British urbanist,

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:46.240
has written about this
in one of his books.

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.930
There's a sort of culmination
of the coming together

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:58.060
of all of the elements of
good culture in a place.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:03.310
This despite anti-Semitism,
violent anti-Semitism

00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:06.490
which was taken
over by the Nazis

00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:08.905
when they took over Austria.

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:26.980
It happened in New
York from 1945 to 1970

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:30.970
with the invention of a number
of new forms of modern art.

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:36.880
The great painters,
Jackson Pollock and others.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.190
I just mentioned it
because it's something

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:45.790
that is not indulged in.

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:52.330
Not many cities in the world
grabbed the world by its--

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:56.050
and it's very
difficult to explain

00:49:56.050 --> 00:50:01.460
what in the history of
Vienna predicted this.

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:07.630
It's certainly true that the
great romantic composers--

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:11.720
Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven--
spent time in Vienna.

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.260
Their music was
constantly performed.

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:16.990
People learned to
play the music.

00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:20.425
Wittgenstein's
sister, as an example.

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:25.900
There were small
groups of philosophy.

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:29.860
The Vienna Circle, the
philosophers in the 1920s,

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:31.640
was significant.

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:35.710
There was music
played in houses.

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:36.640
People were familiar.

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:47.360
Wittgenstein's father had
a large set of children.

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:48.950
Three of them committed suicide.

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.500
They were all musically attuned.

00:50:54.500 --> 00:51:00.110
One of them as a child could,
according to a biography,

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:02.260
distinguish between--

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:05.900
when a band played
outside their house,

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:09.050
he could tell what was wrong
with the band's playing.

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:14.010
He could tell which instruments
were playing the wrong music.

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:18.170
So there was a culture of
music built into the society.

00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:21.320
I don't know if Freud had
anything to do with music.

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:25.610
He probably was too
busy with his trying

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:28.145
to understand the psychic mind.

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:35.580
So the Vienna story is an art
story of a number of things--

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:39.600
the move from a feudal to a
liberal to a socialist city

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.210
and then back to a modern city.

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:48.260
A number of things
that I've touched on.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:54.290
It's one of the great
cities in history.

00:51:54.290 --> 00:52:00.800
It's the only city which built
a single road to dedicate itself

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:05.090
to a new environment,
economically and socially.

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.090
And what else can
one say about Vienna?

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:13.660
It's still a city which
is remarkably well

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:16.320
cared for planning-wise.

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.840
The deputy mayor had
a staff of something

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:23.800
like 1,500 people in his
planning transportation

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:24.940
section.

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:34.120
It has a journey to work,
which is 60%, I think,

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:39.400
in public transportation, 40%
in private transportation.

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:45.220
It's done very well.

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:49.090
Barcelona is a smaller
city out on the fringes.

00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:52.720
All of these cities of
course were Roman cities--

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.720
London, Paris,
Vienna, and Barcelona.

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:08.710
The story of Barcelona,
Cerda, and the ensanche

00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:11.950
is a complicated story and
requires a lot of time,

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:13.900
so I'll jump very quickly.

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:21.510
The old city of Barcelona
with its Roman walls

00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:29.140
and then its enlarged walls was
the densest in Europe in 1830.

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:31.750
It had 300 inhabitants
per hectare.

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:35.385
It was twice the density
of the very dense Paris.

00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:57.190
It suffered from epidemics in
1834, 1854, 1864, and 1870.

00:53:57.190 --> 00:54:05.020
Between 1837 and 1847, average
life expectancy amongst men

00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:11.950
was 38.9 for the rich
and 19.7 for the poor.

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:14.560
It's difficult to believe
that the average life

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.720
expectancy could be
under 20 years of age,

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:21.790
but if you include the
infant mortality in that,

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:26.320
infant mortality takes a
large number of deaths.

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:40.800
So we have the condition
of an old city.

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:53.430
No apparent market for the
wealthy occupying the old city.

00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:58.080
No program is in Paris or
London for the transformation

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.980
of the old city.

00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:04.320
There was no royalty
in Barcelona.

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.120
Royalty was in Madrid.

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:10.770
There was a constant tension
between Barcelona and Madrid.

00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:15.270
In fact, Barcelona claimed
a certain independence

00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:21.190
for Catalonia, and
Catalonia has always

00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:25.780
been stuck between
Spain and France.

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:28.990
Perhaps that's why Picasso
comes from Catalonia.

00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:40.070
I want to jump into the
story of the extension.

00:55:46.258 --> 00:55:49.500
The extension is the mark
of one man's thinking.

00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:59.790
It was [INAUDIBLE] Ildefons
Cerda born in 1845--

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:00.290
sorry.

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:02.660
1815.

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:07.220
Decided to study engineering,
and at the age of 19

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:08.300
went to Madrid--

00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:13.520
he comes from Barcelona,
went to Madrid to study.

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:18.680
Graduated in 1847.

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:24.320
Enlisted in the national
militia from 1841 to 1848.

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:28.520
He did projects in cities in
Spain, highways infrastructure

00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.980
for the ministry of engineering.

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:35.120
He developed a powerful
political base in Madrid.

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:40.610
He returned to
Barcelona in 1849.

00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:44.015
In 1854, the walls
began to be taken down.

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:52.820
Cerda did something
extraordinary.

00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:56.255
He first of all decided to
do research in the old city.

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:04.760
In volume three of his book
General Themes of Urbanization,

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:13.160
written in 1858, he details
patterns of food consumption,

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:16.040
compares the old city
with other cities,

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:20.320
detailed maps, mortality rates.

00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:22.340
He found that the
bourgeois had an average

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:31.270
of 3.6 cubic meters of space,
where the working class only

00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:33.730
had 0.9.

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:35.440
That's four times less.

00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:44.590
Imagine this man going
into the old city

00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:50.020
and doing all of this work.

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:53.050
I don't know what
his ambitions were,

00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:57.670
but this example of
research before plan

00:57:57.670 --> 00:58:01.780
stands as the first
time somebody has

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:08.200
taken the obligation to
study existing facts,

00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.660
especially above poverty.

00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:14.780
Remember that Booth's
map in London was 1789.

00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:15.280
No.

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.800
1879.

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:19.990
This was before
Booth's map of London.

00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:29.170
This is not Engels
studying Manchester.

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:36.280
[INAUDIBLE] studied
Manchester partly

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:41.320
to gather the facts on which to
base a large universal theory

00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.850
of society.

00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:49.480
It's unclear what
Cerda was doing.

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:52.150
He just wanted to know facts.

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:54.430
He wanted to know reality.

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:55.870
He had no large theory.

00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:57.730
Apparently he didn't have.

00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:13.960
In 1859, there was a
competition for designing

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:20.140
a plan outside the old city.

00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:29.250
Cerda and a man
called Rovira i Trias

00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:34.050
competed for the final
of architects in general.

00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:37.800
And most of the
people of Barcelona

00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:41.100
preferred Rovira i Trias's plan.

00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:46.560
Rovira i Trias took the old
city as the center, created

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:50.720
the [INAUDIBLE]
[? republica ?] north of it,

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:55.800
and from that point radiated
out five avenues out

00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:58.330
to the perimeter.

00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:05.990
This is a neoclassical plan
which was relatively common

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:07.400
in city expansion.

01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:17.540
Cerda's plan was a series of
113 meters by 113 meters blocks,

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:22.850
all identical except for the
disposition of the buildings

01:00:22.850 --> 01:00:24.240
on them.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:29.180
So there was a grid system laid
out over an extensive area.

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:34.760
It could continue
without disruption.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:42.200
Roads were 20 meters, 35
meters, or 50 meters wide.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.720
There was six cubic meters
of space per person.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:52.820
It was double the middle
income level at the time.

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:57.950
It was part of Cerda that
was extremely rational.

01:00:57.950 --> 01:01:02.930
That formula that is on
the left is his formula

01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:15.770
for the width of the road, x
being the side of the block,

01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:18.440
2b being the width
of the street,

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.090
f being the depth of
the building site,

01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:24.350
v being the number of
inhabitants per house,

01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:30.440
p equals the squared
meters size per person,

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.650
d equals the height
of the facade,

01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:39.170
all rationally
calculated to produce it.

01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:41.910
The detail of the
formula is not important.

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:45.260
It's nonsense, but
it shows something

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:50.170
about the mind of a person who--

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:53.860
what's going on in his mind?

01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:55.420
He's trained as an engineer.

01:01:55.420 --> 01:02:00.130
He's worked in cities
all over Spain.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:06.670
He returns to Barcelona,
spends his efforts

01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:10.705
documenting poverty,
then emerges with a plan.

01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:17.440
There's an interesting
side story to this.

01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:26.890
The critics and writers about
the ensanche in Barcelona

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:29.860
were extraordinarily
loyal to the Barcelona

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:36.640
and to Ildefons Cerda, who is
considered a national hero.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:42.520
By the way, the reason the
city chose Cerda's plan

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.345
over Trias's plan was because
of pressure from Madrid.

01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:53.130
Cerda in his years
in Madrid working

01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:56.610
for the national militia
had made friends,

01:02:56.610 --> 01:03:02.610
and his radical plan
was forced on Barcelona.

01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:07.940
Now Barcelona cannot be
happier about the plan.

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:10.560
Cerda is a great hero.

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:15.090
There's an aspect of
Cerda which comes through

01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:17.670
not from Barcelonans.

01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:21.480
I don't know the Barcelona
literature extensively,

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:25.740
but a man has recently
written a book

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:31.830
pointing out that Cerda belonged
to a small group of people,

01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:37.890
intellectuals in Barcelona who
were attracted to socialism.

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:44.460
Amongst their members was
a man called [INAUDIBLE],,

01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:48.810
who was one of the designers
of the modern submarine.

01:03:48.810 --> 01:03:50.635
Strange people.

01:03:50.635 --> 01:03:51.135
Poets.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.440
Apparently, they were
very influenced by French

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:02.730
intellectual utopianist called
Etienne Cabet, C-A-B-E-T,

01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:07.550
who wrote a book called
A Voyage to Icaria.

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:22.420
Cabet proposed in his ideal
city a center with the capital,

01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:25.210
and then an equal
distribution of space

01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:29.180
every 360 degrees
around the center.

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:36.970
Cabet worked in the
British Museum reading room

01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:38.830
just like Marx did.

01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:40.430
I don't think they
knew each other.

01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:43.750
They were years apart.

01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:50.170
Cabet insisted that
the United States

01:04:50.170 --> 01:04:56.708
was the place to build a
utopia, as many Europeans did.

01:04:56.708 --> 01:04:57.625
Fourier, for instance.

01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:05.830
There's a paradox about Fourier
and the Fourierist community

01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:09.760
in the United States, but that's
for another class when you talk

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:14.140
about utopianism next week.

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:21.010
Cabet bought land in New Orleans
and took 79 Cabetians with him

01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:23.650
to New Orleans.

01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:25.000
They hated New Orleans.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.800
The climate was awful.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:30.490
They didn't know anything
about the land they bought.

01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:35.180
They were sold a piece of
land which was really bad.

01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:40.280
They moved north to Nauvoo,
N-A-U-V-O-O, Illinois,

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:45.730
which is one of the sequence
of places that the Mormons

01:05:45.730 --> 01:05:50.440
capitalized on on the trek from
the East Coast to Salt Lake

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.670
City.

01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:56.410
They took over Nauvoo,
Illinois, which didn't succeed.

01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:59.620
[INAUDIBLE],, for instance,
wanted to join them.

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:05.170
He wrote to Etienne Cabet, but
Cabet had died in the meantime,

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.870
and the whole enterprise
suffered terribly.

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:18.320
How much of this Cerda knew
or how much of this Cerda

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:23.180
was interested in is
difficult to know.

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:27.170
He remains an enigmatic
figure but a man

01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:31.910
who achieved enormous amounts.

01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:39.800
His plan was built, built
to a certain degree.

01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:54.800
The grid system was maintained,
but the amount and disposition

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:57.730
of this site changed.

01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:02.570
It's in the diagram on one
of the pages I gave you.

01:07:02.570 --> 01:07:11.000
We'll see Cerda's wish to have
a fluctuating system, where

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.960
the site was either occupied
by two buildings, three

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:20.600
buildings, or four completely
enclosed by four buildings.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.480
For Cerda, the
height of the facade

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:28.730
was to be limited
to three floors.

01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:32.940
There were no elevators
in existence yet.

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:33.440
Anyway.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.930
The height of the blocks
were 16 meters maximum.

01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:47.600
That's a ground floor
and three floors,

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.640
and the maximum
coverage was 50%.

01:07:56.220 --> 01:08:05.060
Cerda had very little to do with
the application of the plan.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:13.080
Here there was no accompanying
policy to make sure

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.400
who lived in the space.

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:23.270
The number of
devices which we've

01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:28.460
invented since Cerda's time to
make sure that we have a mixed

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:33.500
population in space sometimes
as simply as putting

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:38.189
a percentage, 15% on new
development in Cambridge,

01:08:38.189 --> 01:08:41.990
Massachusetts to be allocated
to affordable housing

01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:45.439
as a part of any
building of new housing.

01:08:45.439 --> 01:08:46.760
There was nothing like that.

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:51.350
Cerda envisioned an
equal spatial plan,

01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:55.370
and isotropic plan
spatially, but he

01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:59.840
didn't understand how to get
an isotropic distribution

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:02.569
of population.

01:09:02.569 --> 01:09:08.029
He envisioned baker's living
next to bankers, communities

01:09:08.029 --> 01:09:11.240
within this grid, each
with their own school,

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:15.109
and so on, and so on, and so
on, but he played little role

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:20.120
that I know in the
execution of the plan.

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:24.529
There's a great--
oh, I've got to rush.

01:09:24.529 --> 01:09:27.310
There's a great paradox here.

01:09:27.310 --> 01:09:32.120
Over time, ensanche
has become developed

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.469
at a much greater density.

01:09:39.450 --> 01:09:47.029
Coverage was increased from
50% to 70%, even more than 70%.

01:09:47.029 --> 01:09:52.729
Height was increased
to 24 meters.

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:56.370
The volume of Cerda's
plan was supposed

01:09:56.370 --> 01:10:00.430
to be 67,000 meters squared.

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:04.620
The 1958 volume of what
has being built on his plan

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:17.960
is over three times as
much, 290,000 square meters.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:23.440
The paradox is that if you go
down the [INAUDIBLE],, which

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:27.820
is the great road built through
the ensanche, this great avenue

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:31.060
which I'll show you
an image of, you

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:34.720
can feel the pedestrian volume.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:40.013
He allowed five meters
of pedestrian width

01:10:40.013 --> 01:10:40.930
throughout the scheme.

01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:48.260
There's an intensity of urban
intensity in this area, which

01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:49.925
is part of its charm.

01:10:57.370 --> 01:11:02.860
Cerda's plan was so
pro forma in a sense

01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:05.260
that it allowed so
many things to happen

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:09.850
after his time, such as the
increase of density and still,

01:11:09.850 --> 01:11:14.530
except for automobile traffic,
able to cope with the world.

01:11:14.530 --> 01:11:17.297
The fact that he made
sideways sidewalks that

01:11:17.297 --> 01:11:20.320
were all that wide
was an indication

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:26.710
of some thinking about
the advent of density.

01:11:26.710 --> 01:11:37.130
He didn't include techniques
which could frustrate

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:40.580
subsequent development.

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:42.770
What happened is
that, as you'll see--

01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:46.790
let's look at the pictures now.

01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:51.470
The Danube, and Vienna
below on the southern border

01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:52.580
of the Danube next.

01:11:56.070 --> 01:12:06.570
The walls as walkways and
pedestrian perambulation zones

01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:08.310
prior to their being removed.

01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:10.255
The glacis on the right.

01:12:10.255 --> 01:12:10.755
Next.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.520
The clear space
after the walls have

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:21.390
been taken down, and the
filling in of this space

01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:23.490
with a single spine.

01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:24.540
Next.

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:35.680
The parliament, town
hall, university, theater,

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.870
accommodation.

01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:41.290
That's Hitler's drawing of
the parliament, by the way.

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:42.792
Not bad.

01:12:42.792 --> 01:12:45.635
He should've got into
architecture school.

01:12:45.635 --> 01:12:46.135
Next.

01:12:50.530 --> 01:12:54.200
The medieval town hall,
which still exists.

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:54.700
Next.

01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:01.140
A [INAUDIBLE],, an
apartment building.

01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:11.610
Large blocks, large volume, and
the phenomenon [? again in ?]

01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:16.830
[? the ?] facade of decorating
the facade with sculpture.

01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:18.870
This is not a flat facade.

01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:19.370
Next.

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:26.670
The entrance to the
apartment building

01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:40.500
has this zone of almost
regal or royal pertinence.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:45.390
Again, these decorative
system which is open and free,

01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:54.840
giving spatial quality to
the extrinsic experience.

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:57.595
Next.

01:13:57.595 --> 01:14:03.570
And Camillo Sitte, a
critique of the what

01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:06.510
he calls the turbine
plaza, a plaza in which you

01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:08.395
enter and move--

01:14:08.395 --> 01:14:11.550
a plaza which is
correctly organized,

01:14:11.550 --> 01:14:16.770
where you enter and leave
only in special places.

01:14:16.770 --> 01:14:19.530
In the center of
the plaza is a space

01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:25.750
for emotional contemplation.

01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:34.620
His proposal in the shaded
zones for recreating a proper

01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:38.460
appearance in front of the
[? votive ?] [? church, ?]

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:43.920
breaking down the openness,
which is credited to actors

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.180
called [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:49.860
He was afraid of open space,
demarcating space in relation

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:52.300
to particular buildings.

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:52.800
Next.

01:14:55.570 --> 01:15:00.520
Otto Wagner's impression for
the expansion of the city

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:04.120
is a series of zones
that articulated

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:08.240
by a kind of expansionist line.

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:13.300
Here is his design
for one of the--

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:21.070
sorry-- or one of the proposed
extension expansion areas.

01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:23.590
Next.

01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:28.000
His preoccupation with
designing industrial buildings.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.870
This is sluice building
on the Danube canal.

01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:34.840
You can see these are--

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:40.450
can you see the wavelike
decoration up on the right?

01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:45.430
This is a man who's carrying
a kind of hybrid system

01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:50.350
in his head, on the one hand,
wanting to make something as

01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:52.940
decidedly modern as possible.

01:15:52.940 --> 01:16:00.760
On the other, decorating it
with a frieze facade decoration.

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:07.440
His subway stop, the Karlsplatz.

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:07.940
Next.

01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:17.190
His buildings in the railways
[INAUDIBLE] new railway system.

01:16:17.190 --> 01:16:21.830
At the same time, this is
a competition entry of his.

01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:24.490
I can't remember what
the building was.

01:16:24.490 --> 01:16:27.970
I think the Academy
of Fine Arts,

01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:31.150
and this is the Postal
Savings Bank building,

01:16:31.150 --> 01:16:34.750
where the decorative
system is on the facade

01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:38.755
in between the regular
machine-like windows.

01:16:38.755 --> 01:16:39.255
Next.

01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:47.630
I didn't have time to go
into this in greater detail,

01:16:47.630 --> 01:16:54.730
but this is Joseph Hoffman's
work in the industrial design

01:16:54.730 --> 01:17:00.880
sector in the great
advances in modern design,

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:04.370
using new materials.

01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:11.170
This is a list of the
theater performances

01:17:11.170 --> 01:17:15.875
for the weekend in Vienna.

01:17:15.875 --> 01:17:16.375
Next.

01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:25.930
Mahler's great Symphony
Number Six, and, to my mind,

01:17:25.930 --> 01:17:29.770
greatest book of
Freud's interpretation

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:33.075
of dreams in 1911.

01:17:33.075 --> 01:17:33.575
Next.

01:17:37.170 --> 01:17:41.265
Karl Marx-Hof and some
of the other hof blocks.

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.500
Karl Marx-Hof on the left.

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:50.450
I think it's 1 and
1/2 kilometers long.

01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:50.950
Next.

01:17:54.900 --> 01:18:00.765
The abiding preoccupation
with sculpture and a flag.

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:10.335
These arches are not entrances.

01:18:10.335 --> 01:18:13.530
They're zones of penetration.

01:18:13.530 --> 01:18:15.570
These are the entrance zones.

01:18:15.570 --> 01:18:19.050
Again, they decorate.

01:18:19.050 --> 01:18:22.650
Apartments are very small.

01:18:22.650 --> 01:18:26.610
Once when I was
visiting this building,

01:18:26.610 --> 01:18:30.390
the taxi driver had lived
in this Karl Marx-Hof,

01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:32.250
and he said he left
because he couldn't

01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:36.930
swing a cat in his apartment.

01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:38.793
Those were his words.

01:18:38.793 --> 01:18:42.657
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:42.657 --> 01:18:47.790
An enormously powerful
manifestation.

01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:52.050
Michael Graves must have
looked at this architecture

01:18:52.050 --> 01:18:56.590
to gain some inspiration
for his buildings.

01:18:56.590 --> 01:18:57.090
Next.

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:02.190
Barcelona.

01:19:02.190 --> 01:19:08.740
Look at the size of the ensanche
compared to the old city,

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:12.640
and you can imagine what Cerda
would have done to Paris,

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:13.710
the [INAUDIBLE] of Paris.

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:25.150
It's worth spending
10 minutes to talk

01:19:25.150 --> 01:19:29.050
about that as an
alternative model for what

01:19:29.050 --> 01:19:34.130
the post-modern Paris
competition's entries did.

01:19:34.130 --> 01:19:34.630
Next.

01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:41.820
Cerda's vision, a
three-floor set of blocks

01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:45.660
differentiating
between two blocks

01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:49.030
which only had one arm
on them, others which

01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:53.420
had two buildings, some which
had three buildings, some where

01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:55.750
the square was enclosed.

01:19:55.750 --> 01:20:00.420
What was actually built is
represented on the right--

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:04.590
enclosed space in the
center, not public space,

01:20:04.590 --> 01:20:10.260
but ambiguous space, sometimes
space which was taken over

01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:14.550
by residents, sometimes space
which was made into parking

01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:18.870
lots, sometimes space
which is just dilapidated,

01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:22.830
but no resolution of the
internal space [? of a ?]

01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:25.465
consolidated four-sided block.

01:20:25.465 --> 01:20:25.965
Next.

01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:31.490
You can see some of
the interior of the--

01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:41.140
there's a difference
between making Karl Marx-Hof

01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:45.820
interior space as a space for
the community with clinics,

01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:50.980
shops, medical facilities,
schools, and so on as

01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:52.090
a concept.

01:20:52.090 --> 01:20:57.640
This is a concept which enclosed
a block in order to galvanize

01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:03.280
the quality of the street,
to increase density,

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:09.455
but left the whole
completely unavailable.

01:21:09.455 --> 01:21:09.955
Next.

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:19.150
Cerda's plan calls
for the blocks

01:21:19.150 --> 01:21:21.730
to be truncated on the corners.

01:21:21.730 --> 01:21:27.790
Here you can see an intersection
of the four corners,

01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:35.710
leaving a messy transportation
intersection problem there.

01:21:35.710 --> 01:21:39.460
One of the arguments made
by the Barcelonans today

01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:42.640
is that this creates
another facade,

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:45.880
and each of these small
square intersections

01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:51.275
have unique facades
facing onto them.

01:21:51.275 --> 01:21:51.775
Next.

01:21:54.660 --> 01:22:02.190
[INAUDIBLE],, the medieval public
walk, and the [INAUDIBLE],,

01:22:02.190 --> 01:22:06.030
this great avenue which
links to the town of Gracia

01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:07.775
in the hills.

01:22:07.775 --> 01:22:08.275
Next.

01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:17.250
The [INAUDIBLE]
[? guardian. ?] Sorry.

01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:21.470
[INAUDIBLE] on the left, the
[INAUDIBLE] on the right.

01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.970
Next.

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:33.730
A great unfinished
cathedral, an attempt

01:22:33.730 --> 01:22:38.230
to modernize the ensanche.

01:22:38.230 --> 01:22:38.730
Next.

01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:46.640
The Barcelona Games
is the only games

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:51.440
that position the
center of the city

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:56.390
as central to the four sides--

01:22:56.390 --> 01:23:02.786
the [INAUDIBLE] side on the
top left, the [INAUDIBLE] side

01:23:02.786 --> 01:23:11.840
for the athletes' housing.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:20.840
Of all the Olympic sites, from
Munich, to Tokyo, to Sydney,

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:25.760
to Melbourne, London, and
so on, none of [INAUDIBLE]

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:31.910
incorporated the proposition
within the central city system.

01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:32.410
Next.

01:23:36.770 --> 01:23:40.550
Two post-Cerda propositions.

01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:42.530
Could you just focus
this one please?

01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:44.630
Thank you.

01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:47.390
This is Corbusier's
and a group called

01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:53.360
[INAUDIBLE],, a modern version
of the extension of the Cerda

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.200
system.

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:59.430
The streets are
gone, or they ignored

01:23:59.430 --> 01:24:08.190
the [INAUDIBLE] system of
Corbusier's engaged in housing.

01:24:08.190 --> 01:24:10.480
There's a huge
amount of open space

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:14.700
which is not allocated
to anybody in particular.

01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:19.810
One prefers the scheme
on the left infinitely.

01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:25.840
A crazy man, Léon Krier,
saying that the problem with

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:31.910
Cerda's plan is the 113
meter size is too large.

01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:38.740
Krier has a dislike of
anything continuous,

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:43.060
so he suggests that
the clock be broken up

01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:52.360
into four modules
of 25 meters each,

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:55.330
where he believed
the market is for all

01:24:55.330 --> 01:24:59.590
of the shopping on
these little corners,

01:24:59.590 --> 01:25:04.420
and the confusion caused
by creating as many corners

01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:06.055
as you like.

01:25:06.055 --> 01:25:10.030
Léon Krier should visit Tel Aviv
and see what happens when you

01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:15.490
subdivide blocks into
two smaller distance.

01:25:15.490 --> 01:25:22.070
It's a silly diagram, but
two examples of post-Cerda

01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.570
thinking.

01:25:28.510 --> 01:25:30.015
I think that's a lot.

01:25:30.015 --> 01:25:30.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:33.190
JULIAN BEINART: Oh, sorry.

01:25:33.190 --> 01:25:35.350
The idea of expanding from--

01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:40.810
by leaving the center allowed
an expanding outwards.

01:25:40.810 --> 01:25:43.870
This is Antonelli's
plan for Torino.

01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:46.720
That is Custer's
plan for Madrid.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.550
Next.

01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:51.010
This is [INAUDIBLE]
plan for [INAUDIBLE],,

01:25:51.010 --> 01:25:54.580
and this is
[? Kritanthis's ?] plan--

01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:57.730
[? Krianthis-Schubert's ?]
plan for Athens.

01:25:57.730 --> 01:26:01.330
All suggest in the
dark gray that you

01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:04.630
maintain the core of
the city, take away

01:26:04.630 --> 01:26:11.320
the walls if necessary, and
produce a free zone outside.

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:13.750
Next.

01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:17.050
Here in the small town
of Altamura in Apulia,

01:26:17.050 --> 01:26:20.830
you see the system
operating in a small town.

01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:26.170
Radiating outwards are
gates to the old city.

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.650
I haven't got time to
go into the detail.

01:26:33.650 --> 01:26:39.110
Here you see a grid
system employed almost

01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:46.610
throughout the surroundings
of the existing walled city.

01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:49.220
If the walls are
taken away or replaced

01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:52.040
by a boulevard
surrounding the city,

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:56.210
nothing like the boulevard
of the Ringstrasse.

01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:58.040
OK.

01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:03.880
Sorry it's so rushed, but the
world is full of information.
