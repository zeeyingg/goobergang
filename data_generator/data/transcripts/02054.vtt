WEBVTT

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.650
PROFESSOR: So the next important
part of turbulent plume theory

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.270
that we need is the distribution
of concentration of particles

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.760
or droplets, in this
case, that are injected

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.280
with the fluid at the source.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.160
So as we've just arrived, the
concentration C in this case,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.400
we could have referred
to infection quanta

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.220
and infectious aerosols
relative to that leaving

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.450
the mouth, which is
we've called C_q, scales

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.750
as square root of area of the
mouth divided by alpha x where

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.520
alpha is the turbulent
entrainment

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.200
coefficient, around 0.1 or 0.15.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.050
And that leads to a
jet which grows in size

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.040
and grows in fluctuations as
you see more and more eddies,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.770
and eventually might
even bend due to flows

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.580
in the room or thermal
buoyancy effects.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.400
And I'd like to talk about the
difference between short range

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.580
transmission due to really
placing yourself in this jet

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.590
and breathing that
air directly, which

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.080
is more concentrated
than the background,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.990
and then compare that
with the transmission

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.370
in the well-mixed
room that we've

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.920
been talking about all along.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.010
So obviously if
we're at position 0

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.930
here right at the mouth, this
is the worst case scenario.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.610
So if we're here, let's
say we're only 1 inch

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.870
or 1 centimeter away.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.420
And we put our mouth on top of
the other person's mouth, that

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.770
is the worst case scenario
of short range transmission.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.780
That is, relative to
the background room,

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.780
we're getting a much
worse situation there.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.870
But if we ask ourselves,
how much worse is it,

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.880
so we know that fd is
the dilution factor, that

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:57.130
is the concentration kind of
at the source relative to C

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.259
sort of at infinity and
the well-mixed room,

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.510
so let's just say far away.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.290
Actually instead of C infinity,
I should call that C average.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.770
Because it is the average
concentration in the room.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.710
And we've seen that
the dilution factor

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.840
can be written as the flow
rate of the breath divided

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.440
by the sort of decay rate
of the concentration field

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.670
at the average--

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.970
at the appropriately
defined mean radius

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.920
divided by the
volume of the room.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.520
So that is telling us how
much more concentrated

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.530
the infection quanta
or viruses are here

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.110
versus the well-mixed room
where they're really spread out.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.160
How big is this factor?

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.000
So this factor for the Skagit
choir, which we've analyzed,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.340
the Skagit Valley Chorale.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.130
So that was a fairly large
room, 4.5 meter ceiling.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.980
But it didn't have
very good ventilation.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.580
So that's sort of
similar to smaller rooms

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.580
with better ventilation.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.250
And in that case, this
number was 10 to the minus 3.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.750
And in general, fd for
typical indoor spaces--

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.480
for offices,
classrooms, and homes--

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.480
is on the order of 10
to the minus 2 to the 10

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.230
to the minus 4.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.980
So there's quite a
significant difference.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.340
If you are right at the
point of somebody's mouth

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.610
and breathing in their
air versus being far away,

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.200
there really is
a big difference.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.990
To put it in perspective,
we can ask ourselves, well,

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.690
how long would you have to
stay in the well-mixed room,

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.190
far away, breathing the air
to have the same exposure

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.960
and dose of infection quanta
as if you put your mouth on top

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.829
of somebody else and breathed
in one lung-full of air.

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:05.410
So if we just say that if we
calculate it as a timescale,

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.590
taking in the volume
of a single breath

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.330
and then dividing that by Q
breath and the dilution factor,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.640
that is the time you
would have to spend

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:23.710
breathing the background air in
order to achieve the same dose.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.820
And this quantity ends up being
for the Skagit choir that we

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.190
calculated around one hour.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.010
So if 63 people were in
the room and 53 or so

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.700
were infected, then
that most likely

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.040
happened through the airborne
route, as we've discussed.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.880
Because 53 people were mostly
breathing the background air

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.130
that was, perhaps, well-mixed.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.220
On the other hand, you
also could infect 53 people

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.409
by taking turns one
at a time putting

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:56.630
their lips against the
other person who's infected

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.870
and just breathing in one
full lung-full of air.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.840
Then you would get
a similar number

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.750
of people infected on the
order of an hour or two,

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.780
which is the length of time
of that choir practice.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.460
But we know that didn't happen.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.910
So that already tells us that
short range transmission really

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.790
can't explain what happened
in the Skagit choir.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.450
And as we've discussed,
it has to be longer range

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.210
airborne aerosol transmission.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.300
But how much longer range?

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.910
We can also sample at
different positions here.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.430
So that's the absolute
worst case scenario.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.900
So let's consider as important
numbers 3 feet and 6 feet.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.520
So 3 feet corresponds
to 1 meter,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.490
which is the social distancing
guideline of the World Health

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.570
Organization today.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.590
I would also argue
that 3 or maybe 2 feet

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.240
is kind of close
to what you might

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.450
call natural social distancing.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.430
So if you don't impose
social distancing,

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.060
most people prefer to
have a little space

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.090
bubble around them.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.610
They don't want to be
right up against somebody

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.520
if they don't have to.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.310
And they tend to stand
2 or 3 feet apart.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.190
So somewhere in
here is what I would

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.100
call natural social
distancing except in cases

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.460
where you're in a crowd.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.550
So if you're in a
nightclub or a bar

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.080
or some crowded
space where you're

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.450
starting to press
against people,

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.040
then you come closer you
might be 1 foot or 1/2 foot,

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.500
and you might start to get
closer to this worst case.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.690
But people tend to be
about 3 feet apart.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.260
So we can ask ourselves
what happens there.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.730
We can also look
a little further.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.610
The Center for Disease
Control the United States

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.640
has imposed a 6 foot rule
as we have discussed.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.790
In fact, it's been interpreted
so strictly in the United

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.430
States that you can find floor
stickers exactly 6 feet apart

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.700
in all sorts of indoor
spaces even when

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.310
people are wearing
masks and when

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.970
we aren't sure exactly
what the flows are like.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.220
And we can ask ourselves,
what is the sort of level

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.430
of concentration there.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.370
It's also worth noting
that we can also

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.030
look at a negative value.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.280
How about minus 3 feet?

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.660
Because it's important to note
that respiratory jets do not

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.610
only increase your risk relative
to the well-mixed ambient,

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.520
there must be regions where
the risk is actually lower

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.690
than the well-mixed ambient.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.520
Because in the end,
the well-mixed solution

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.260
was obtained by mass balance.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.860
So that means we've essentially
counted all the infection

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.810
quanta or virions in the room.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.910
And if there is a higher
concentration here,

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.040
there must be a lower
concentration somewhere else

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.130
to account for that.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.520
So perhaps if you're
standing behind somebody

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.110
at a reasonable
distance, you actually

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.450
have a lower concentration,
although there is still

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.440
mixing going on.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.390
And you will be exposed
to the well-mixed room.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.600
Which then brings me to the
way that we should really

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.260
think about the role of
short range transmission

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.610
versus long range transmission.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.950
And that is to compare
the concentration

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.090
of the respiratory jet to
that of the well-mixed ambient

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.320
that we calculated.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.210
That's essentially
the definition

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:59.880
of when there's a transition
from short range to long range

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.000
behavior.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.050
So where will that occur?

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.250
It will typically
be somewhere here.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:10.040
So there's a certain
position, which we'll call xC,

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.690
and this will be
defined by saying

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:17.070
that C over the initial value
is equal to the dilution factor.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.330
So this is the point where if
I follow this orange curve,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.010
I've just hit the
concentration that

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.430
is predicted for the background
well-mixed room, which we've

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.630
already calculated before.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.660
So if you use our
formula for C there,

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.650
you then get a formula
for this xC, which

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:43.110
is the square root of the mouth
area times lambda C of r bar,

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.330
so the decay rate of
the concentration field,

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.750
the volume of the room,
and then alpha QB.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.300
So I would argue
that this is really

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.810
the boundary which
separates long range

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:08.810
airborne transmission by
aerosols with short range

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:13.140
transmission, which also
includes aerosols by the way.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.560
So some of these
aerosol droplets,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.270
you definitely could be
inhaling anywhere in here.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.820
But if you go long
range, you're only

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.010
talking about aerosol droplets.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.320
So this is really where
the dividing line is.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.690
And if you plug in numbers
for different settings,

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.010
you'll find this is
often larger than 6 feet.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.820
In fact, in some
cases, many cases,

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.280
it's actually larger
than the room.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.230
It could be tens of meters even,
because this dilution factor

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:39.490
can be of order a
factor 100 or even

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.970
10,000 lower concentration
in the well-mixed room

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.320
than at the person's mouth.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.480
So you have to go pretty
far away to see it actually

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.800
drop back down.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.410
What that means is that when
people are breathing in a room

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.580
these breaths are crossing
all over the place.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.650
They're mixing.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:57.310
And you really can't think about
a turbulent plume lasting out

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.470
to infinity because there is
another person standing here,

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.580
there's ventilation flow,
there are thermal flows.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.670
All of the mechanisms we talked
about mixing will take this jet

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.230
and start to mix
it around the room

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.360
so it won't look like a
perfect jet all the way.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.940
But at least this
gives us an estimate

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.900
for these closer
spaces here that's

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.060
sort of what our risk might be.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.140
So using this concept, I'll
just mention this is typically

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:25.330
much bigger than 6 feet, we
could estimate how much worse

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.190
is it to be 6 feet
or 3 feet away

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.980
with yourself in a worst
case scenario perfectly

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.110
placed in a respiratory jet.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.360
So what we're
asking here is what

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:40.690
if we were unlucky enough to
be right here and breathing

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.770
in for a long period of time.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.610
So not just for a
fleeting second but you're

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.200
sitting there and
just over and over

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.610
you're just sitting
here breathing

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:49.900
in that person's breath.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.520
It's not an
unreasonable situation.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.170
You could imagine
at a meeting when

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.550
two people are
sitting at a table

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.260
or maybe they're having dinner.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.660
Masks are off, they
are facing each other,

00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.690
talking to each other.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.720
And in fact that is
a high risk situation

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.490
in terms of this
kind of transmission.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.400
So let's see how much
worse it actually could be.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:13.270
Well, if you plug in the numbers
then using a typical mouth

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:18.480
area, in this case
the concentration

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.550
drops to about 6%.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:26.050
In this case, the concentration
since it's what goes as 1

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.530
over distance, is more like 3%.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.030
So it's a very
rough calculation.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.360
But relative, and I should
say, so relative to the highest

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.310
concentration of
reaching the mouth,

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.170
the plume has been
diluted down to 6% or 3%

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.260
as you go these distances.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:47.500
Notice there's not a massive
difference between 3 and 6.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.570
And it does make a
very big difference

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.650
in terms of decisions
to reopen spaces

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.650
and how people interact,
whether you're strictly

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.500
6 feet apart or
perhaps you can be 3.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.980
So keep in mind that
3% to 6% dilution.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.680
But what we're really
interested in here

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.500
is now, how do these
fractions compare

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.460
with the well-mixed room.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.010
And so for that I
actually would like

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:13.300
to do a different comparison
as I'd like to do C over fd.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.690
Because fd, relative to here,
is the concentration far away.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:24.190
So I want C over C_q,
I should say, over fd.

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:30.160
And so this also can be
written as xC over x.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.060
So it's basically how much
farther is that crossover point

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.480
relative to where
you're standing.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.160
That's another way
to think about it.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:42.240
And this is then six to 600.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:48.490
So this is the excess risk.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:52.750
If you were to
stand 3 feet away,

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.540
that's the excess risk you face
from short range transmission

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.730
if you are 100% of
the time breathing

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:02.020
in the jet of the infected
person pointing right at you

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.730
all the time.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:07.750
If you take this 6 foot rule,
it's a little bit less strong.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.870
You have a C over
C_q divided by fd.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.540
It is more like three to 300.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.220
It, again, depends on
the details of the room.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.800
But it still can be
a significant factor.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.330
So we will come back
to thinking about how

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.720
to handle short transmission
in light of its interaction

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.820
with long range.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.680
But let me make
one final comment

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.280
on this discussion, which is
where is this crossover point.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.580
So notice it scales with volume.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.770
So something you
may be wondering

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.050
is, don't we have
airborne transmission

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:46.350
and shortwave transmission
outdoors also.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.850
Yes.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.340
And that is actually covered
by the theoretic arguments

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.300
that we're making here.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.810
Although, as I said, these
jets really can't last forever.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.850
But we can at least
say to ourselves, what

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.380
happens as v goes to infinity.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.890
So I like to call this
the outdoor limit.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.130
If you apply our safety
criterion for a well-mixed room

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.280
to very big room, think of,
for example, a gymnasium

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.780
or a sports stadium,
very, very big room, then

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.880
if there's only one
infected person,

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.900
then the dilution of those
droplets in a massive space

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.650
is like being outside.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.140
You might as well be outside.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.790
And what you find
that is the crossover

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.270
is very far away, which means
the long range analysis is not

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:27.900
even helpful.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.460
It's not even valid.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.170
Really, it's the
short range analysis

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.760
you'd be thinking about.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.560
Now unfortunately, the
short range analysis

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.180
depends on many
assumptions about how

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.130
people are positioned,
how they're interacting,

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.600
what are the local flow fields.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.720
But you have to deal with
short range transmission.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.530
And social distancing
can play a role

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.420
in how you address that threat.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.480
But once you get to smaller
rooms and longer periods

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.220
of time then you actually
find that this xC is

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.480
on the order of the room size.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.260
And then you really are going
to be having significant effects

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.910
of long range transmission.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:03.810
And I will argue that
for most typical rooms

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:09.060
that we inhabit indoors, that
the long range airborne risk is

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.180
the leading order first
approximation and best

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.350
approximation.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.380
And the short range
risk must be considered,

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.070
but it's a correction to that.
