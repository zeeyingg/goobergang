JULIAN BEINART: The piece that
I've had handed out to you

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:39.790
covers the trajectory that
we will follow from 1 to 7.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.420
Let me make a comment
about the formal structure

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.810
of these examples.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.810
The grid is a
universal language.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.330
It is used in the cosmic
model in Xi'an in 190 BC.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.830
And it's used in the 1811
Manhattan extension plan.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.920
The assumption is, if one
takes this too literally,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.240
is that the grid
is a language which

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.695
can perform its function
in almost any context.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.140
That is possibly true.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.380
In each case, it requires
one to ask questions

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.830
about the nature of
the grid-- its context,

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:49.450
its size, its manifestation,
what the contemporary culture

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.690
was attempting to produce.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.830
The commissioners who laid out
the 1811 Plan for Manhattan

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.620
spoke in terms of
trying to create

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.540
the most everyday
environment they could.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.700
What does every
day mean to them?

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.800
They're the examples
of New Amsterdam,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.730
the Dutch settlement, and
the British settlement,

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.680
which followed.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.280
Wall Street, by the
way, was the separation

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.590
between the English
and Dutch settlements.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.800
So the explanation for the
centralized cosmic order

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.720
of Xi'an and the
same or similar use

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.910
of a grid in
Manhattan many years

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:54.210
later with this second set
of plans or plans for grids

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:00.120
of many European center cities.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.970
They're all grids,
but infinitely varied

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.220
in size and dimension.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:19.000
The diagram is that of a
Bastide town in the southwest.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.260
This one happens to be a town
which divides the blocks up

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.170
according to a
diagonal measurement.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.630
I'll deal with that
move more carefully.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.650
The next is a diagram,
a fictitious diagram,

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:43.000
of a Roman town showing
the rectangularity which

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.330
exists around the
tying of a central knot

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.780
by this subdivision
of the blocks

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.070
according to a
horizontal east-west line

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:01.420
and this north-south line,
the Decumanus and the Cardo.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.630
And the second last--

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.270
the last is an example of
contemporary fascination

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:17.709
with linearity following the
notion of machine performance.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.190
Henry Ford who probably
advocated assembly line

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.470
production more than any other
industrialist in modern times

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.230
when he wanted to make
his own city in Muscle

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:45.730
Shoals in Alabama, didn't
use a linear system.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.930
Well, maybe-- there are very
few plans of Muscle Shoals.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.740
But it was a long city
which really interfaced

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.150
agriculture and industry.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.950
Ford's notion was
that America had

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.530
gone wrong in
building industrialism

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.874
without agriculture.

00:05:08.874 --> 00:05:11.980
He's postured it for
Muscle Shoals, which I'll

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.110
discuss later in this class.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.690
It's interesting.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.240
Every person-- Henry Ford
said, anybody who works for me

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.530
should spend part of
his time in a garden

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.740
or in a creative agricultural
performance of some kind.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.440
The example on the
second to last page,

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.690
Southwest Washington in
plan, and our first notion

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.210
that the city should be made up
over time by points of interest

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.410
based on the topography and
on a diagonalized system

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.240
of connection was
opposed by Jefferson.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.330
Jefferson made an
earlier plan which

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.000
is very difficult
to decipher but is

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.550
longitudinal and rectangular.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.060
L'Enfant is quoted here as
saying, how boring a grid plan

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.560
is.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.670
"Grid plans are tiresome and
insipid, however, answerable

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.750
they may appear on
paper or seducing

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.740
as they may be on first
aspect to the eyes,"

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.740
compared to Alexandria
in 77, which

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.800
was a rectangular
plan, which was

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.080
occupied right
from the beginning

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:53.110
and worked
subsequently very well.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.520
So one of the aspects
of the machine model,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.350
which this seems to
suggest, is that it has

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.520
a very high speed of return.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:12.090
You can have a plan in an
extreme situation, which

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:17.350
requires a minimal
amount of surveying.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.000
It has a high aspect
of legibility.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:28.380
According to Gestalt's
theorist of urban form,

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.250
they would say that it's
because there is only one angle

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.010
in a right angle intersection.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.430
Any other intersection
involves more than one angle.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.090
And the basic fundamental
law of visual economy,

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.420
would suggest that you
would prefer the security

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.190
of the right angle.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.200
That is a linguistic assumption.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.860
And it's probably got a meta
truth associated with it.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:02.130
It's not the only reason
that this grid form

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:06.570
appears in the machine model.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:11.220
The cosmic model, which
we discussed last time,

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.010
put forward the ideal
of a crystalline city,

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:19.050
stable and hierarchical,
a magical microcosmos

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:24.390
in which each part was fused
into a perfectly ordered whole.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:29.190
If it changed at all, it did
so only in this mechanical--

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.860
not in mechanical--
rhythmical, ordered,

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.630
completely unchanging way.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.110
Thinking of the city as a
practical machine on their own

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.999
is an utterly
different conception.

00:08:42.999 --> 00:08:45.450
A machine also has
permanent parts,

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.340
but the parts move
and move each other.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.970
The machine can change,
although it does so

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.430
in some clearly predictable way.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:59.010
Stability is inherent in
the parts, not necessarily

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.660
in the whole.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.940
A whole grows by addition.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.270
The wider meaning is simply
the sum of its parts.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:10.380
It can be taken apart,
put together in reverse.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.690
Its pieces can be replaced.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:18.210
It is factual, functional,
cool, not magical at all.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.030
This is a very basic statement,
that you can arm machine

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.820
with magical
properties is perfectly

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.040
possible for the human brain.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.410
We will see in
the later examples

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:43.800
where, in fact, this is an
aspect of the machine model

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.900
which appears much later.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.225
In its earliest
times, it's very pure.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:58.620
The machine model occurs
historically most often

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:04.140
when its settlements are
temporary, secondly when

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.320
they have to be built
in haste or being

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.000
built for clear,
limited practical aims.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.430
The expansion of Manhattan
North of Houston Street

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.760
invoked no magical properties.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:26.170
When the Rockefellers intervened
and built Rockefeller Center,

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:32.940
there was some sense they did
so partly, historians claim,

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.620
to maintain the hegemony
over that part of Manhattan

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.110
where their house was.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:44.130
Rockefeller Center
can be seen to fit

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.030
into the overall machine-like
system of Manhattan,

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:55.140
yet on its own it evokes
larger cultural invocation.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:00.040
We'll talk more about that as
we talk later on in this class

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.300
about some of this.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:18.650
I said, it's most useful
in temporary situations

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.430
when the environment
is built in haste,

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:26.870
when it's built for clear of
limited practical purposes.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:31.610
But it's also used to allocate
land and resources quickly.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:36.500
There's a kind of built-in idea
of equal distribution in mind

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.360
as well.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.790
You'll recall
Marx's comment which

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:42.680
I made at the
beginning of the class

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.810
about the emerging distinction
between country and city.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.720
What emerges as
urbanization occurs

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.800
is increasing gap in land
value between anything

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.840
that's urbanized and
anything that ruralized.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:09.320
To pay back the enormous
investment in labor,

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.570
the Romans, for
instance, paid back

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:15.740
veterans who served
in the army by land.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:21.380
It needed to subdivide the
land in an equitable fashion.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:27.500
The word in English "lot,"
it refers to a plot of land

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.410
has the same root
as the word lottery.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.680
The lottery was used
quite extensively

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.140
in this equalization.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:43.460
So the machine model becomes
a checkerboard in some sense

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:52.400
in which you can give people
the promise of land value,

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:57.470
but you cannot exactly
initiate a central point.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.320
There may be a central point
the crossing of the Cardo

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.700
and Decumanus, but that would
be reserved for the Roman Forum,

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.930
not for private land.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:13.340
In the Laws of the
Indies, Los Angeles,

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.550
the last of the Laws of in the
Indies cities in the United

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:23.480
States, the Central Plaza
was 200 by 400 feet.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.990
And then the grid
spread out from that.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:35.330
So this notion of a democratic
distribution of urban land

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:40.895
is fundamentally in the process
of urbanizing at low cost--

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.590
conditional low cost.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:50.480
The cosmic model required
enormous investments

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.020
in defense.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:05.050
The first set of examples we
look at are the Egyptian slave

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:11.590
quarters built to
promote the eternal life

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:18.280
of the pharaonic
cult. For reasons

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:26.080
which are rather obscure,
Egypt was not accompanied.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.700
Egypt's development
from 3,000 BC onwards

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:35.560
didn't involve
internecine warfare,

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.430
which meant that no
investment need to be made

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.240
in wars to defend a local site.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.480
Once you invest
in the local site

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.545
and pay for the cost of
fortification, you don't move.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.660
Cairo was a much
later phenomenon.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:04.110
In the 3,000 years
until about 600 BC,

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.680
there were no cities in Egypt.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.420
Thebes and Memphis were
only temporary cities.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:19.350
They were built to enable the
construction of the metamorph--

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:25.860
not metamorphosis-- the
metaphysical structures

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.280
for the post-life
of the pharaoh.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.910
It took so much
human labor to build

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:44.420
one of these cosmic structures
that the idea of labor and cost

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.950
and materials didn't go
into anything which we would

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.200
describe as a normal city.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.480
It went instead
into the business

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.310
of construction and the
environment for the afterlife.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:03.290
Yet that piece of the
pharaonic complex,

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:08.660
which housed the laborers,
were based on a per striga

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.930
system of block
development, which

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.490
we'll show you in the slide.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:14.990
But--

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:19.845
AUDIENCE: I have
a question there.

00:16:19.845 --> 00:16:21.765
JULIAN BEINART: Yes.

00:16:21.765 --> 00:16:23.640
AUDIENCE: If I wanted
to make of these cities

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.000
the amount of resources
that you have invested,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.020
both in time and
effort, that cements

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.300
the population [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.720
JULIAN BEINART: Sure, sure.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],, how
does it work in cities like--

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.880
I'm thinking of
Teotihuacan in Mexico,

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.590
Fatehpur Sikri in India,
that for this vast complex

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:44.792
that eventually they--

00:16:44.792 --> 00:16:46.500
JULIAN BEINART: Both
of them disappeared.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.960
Fatehpur Sikri
disappeared because

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.920
of a fundamental problem
of water, a miscalculation

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.320
of the amount of
salt in the water,

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.940
which caused the city to be--

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.530
prior to modern times few
cities have disappeared.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.859
Fatehpur Sikri is one of them.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:16.790
Teotihuacan under Mexican rule
became a tourist artifact.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:20.060
The Aztec religion was
no more fundamental

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:24.589
after the Spanish hegemony.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:27.440
So it lost its
fundamental purpose.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.290
We don't lose citizens
easily anymore.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:37.100
And that is an argument will
come about later in this class.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:41.780
But bear in it mind,
the death of cities

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.920
is really a phenomenon
of pre-modern times.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.750
And both examples
you give, in the one

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:55.820
lost its fundamental
mechanical system.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:18:00.200
Salty water is no longer the
basis for a wonderful town

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.080
that Fatehpur Sikri was.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:10.160
And Teotihuacan didn't
have an adaptive mechanism

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.040
to sustain its growth.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.460
It was no reason for it to grow.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:21.950
Tenochtitlan, on the other
hand, had all of the capacity

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.500
as a capital city on the lake.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.530
The combination of
the mysterious quality

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:33.890
of the original-- of
the landing of the eagle

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.195
in the center of the cosmos.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:42.020
That was taken over as
an astronomic-- anyway,

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.820
we'll talk more about this.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.290
You raised an
interesting argument.

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:56.230
According to the fifth century
Greek historian Herodotus

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.410
told--

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.950
I don't know how he knew
this, but 100,000 men

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.410
were engaged for
three months each year

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:10.670
for 20 years in moving blocks
of stone to a pharaonic site.

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.630
He claims that
there must have been

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.360
something like
4,000 workers which

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.400
had to be housed permanently.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.740
So Leonard Woolley
the archaeologist

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:32.750
writing about Tell el-Amarna
describes the housing

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:37.220
as monotonously alike, each with
its kitchen parlor in front,

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.740
its cupboards and
bedrooms behind,

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:43.385
the very patina of mechanically
devised industrial building.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:49.960
Same arguments made by
other archaeologists.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:57.290
The distinction between
enslavement of labor and cultic

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:02.881
objectives is characteristic
of this Egyptian phenomenon.

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:11.540
A more elaborate system
of using the machine model

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.730
takes place in
Hellenistic towns.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.970
In colonial situations,
it's very unlikely

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.360
that the mother city
will be replicated

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.850
in the colonial system.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.190
Delhi is not like London.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:35.000
The Laws of the Indies towns,
Bogota, is not like Madrid.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.290
Athens had its own
unique structure.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.570
It was an Iraqi site.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:46.340
It had limited
agricultural resources.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:51.830
And it needed to expand as part
of its Mediterranean expansion

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:56.900
to the south to Africa,
to the east to Asia Minor,

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:03.065
and to the west eventually to
Sicily and to Southern Italy.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:17.240
The building of
colonial empire took

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:23.060
place not because of the
advantages of the mother city.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.900
In fact, fifth century
democracy in Athens

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.880
is unlikely to have been spread.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.430
There's one theory that
says the Greek islands

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:38.530
or the Greek colonial sites--

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:44.180
not islands-- were the result
of the expansion of democracy.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:48.740
Democracy only occurred
in the first century BC.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:56.420
The colonial expansion
of the Greeks

00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:00.500
prior to that,
the most important

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.590
of the colonial towns,
the grid-like towns,

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:09.830
was built in 479 by the planner
Hippodamus, who had a stutter,

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:14.220
he had long hair, and had
interesting political theories.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.000
He discovered the method
of dividing cities

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.190
and cut up Pireas.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:22.850
He's also known
by some historians

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.870
as the inventor of the
gridiron and the father

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:28.010
of town planning.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:33.200
Hippodamus, 479, Miletus--
this was the first time

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:40.850
that a town was considered as
a totality in a certain sense.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:44.330
All the parts of the
town were in place,

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:46.070
except perhaps for industry.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:48.470
One doesn't know
from archaeology

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:52.190
how much industry took place
in these colonial times.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:55.160
They were essentially
trading towns.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.330
Mumford argues that
the grid serves

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:05.660
as a method for making form of
clarity of international trade.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.550
There's something to
be said for having

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:14.630
a recognizable or legible
environment as you

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:17.780
move into new environments.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.580
You put your stamp on a place.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:23.870
It's almost like building a
Hilton Hotel, which hardly

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:26.780
serves to emulate
the environment

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.210
or to affect the environment.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:33.530
But Mumford's argument is
that modern trade requires

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.680
a standardization of commodity.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:41.360
He later on, in talking about
American grid of expediency,

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.710
refers to capitalism and
the grid of expediency

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:51.960
as phenomenally correct
and absolutely connected.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.740
Whether this is
true, we will discuss

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:59.010
as we go through this class.

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:04.410
There's no absolute connection
between capitalist theory

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:05.870
and grid phenomena.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:15.240
I'll speak to this point
a bit later in this class.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.210
The other towns of
distinction were

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:21.750
Olynthus in the Northern
Greek peninsula.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.520
Oh no, it's not on
the peninsula-- it's

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.650
further north, north of Athens.

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:29.250
And Priene, 300 BC.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:33.930
All of these involve
the same phenomena

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.000
shaped within the grid.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.080
And agora, a wall, a
wall didn't conform

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.190
to the grid-like system.

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:47.490
These towns were built
on defensible sites

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:52.650
so that the wall system was
informal and took account

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:59.990
of the minimum ways of building
infrastructure on sloping land.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:04.590
The British architect Peter
Smithson in a talk on the BBC

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:08.820
once argued against the
classical vocabulary of Greece.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.710
He of course, is
an architect who

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:13.740
very interested in informalism.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.450
And he argued that
one should really

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:19.530
look at the Greek fortifications
as a structure for one's

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:25.260
intellectual heritage rather
than the classical system

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:28.080
of the Greeks.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.830
Cartilaginous whether he's right
or wrong, and he won't tell us.

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:52.345
There is no central axis made by
the intersection of major axis.

00:25:52.345 --> 00:25:55.180
The agora was at the center.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:00.940
The grid was exemplified, again,
as a grid of absolute equality.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:12.040
These towns have had lives
beyond the Greek time.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:18.130
They were taken by Hellenism,
by Romans, and most of them

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:19.030
disappeared.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:29.470
They couldn't withstand-- the
requirements have changed.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:33.970
Greece was replaced as a
power in the Mediterranean

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.540
and [INAUDIBLE] disappeared.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:45.540
But I have referred to Mumford.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.140
He says, I quote, "a new
regularity and system

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:56.430
in commercial affairs
causes a formal order

00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:01.095
that when you are faced with
the presence of a hill or curved

00:27:01.095 --> 00:27:04.590
bay, there's no
effort to adaptation

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:08.420
for change of pattern."

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:14.840
A similar phenomenon
occurs in the Roman Empire.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.340
I'm just going
through these things

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.730
very quickly because
we're limited in time.

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:24.140
Each of these examples has
a literature available.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:29.900
If any of you want to follow the
particular literature involved,

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:34.370
just send me an email and
I'll send you the references.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:38.330
It's impossible in a class like
this to go into the details

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:42.050
more than the
general description.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:46.460
You have to assume that the
generalizations are correct.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.860
It's my fault if they wrong.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:59.610
Built cities in an empire--

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:07.710
there was no empire to the
extent in the world's history

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:11.160
prior to the Roman
Empire, not in scale.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:16.260
The Romans built something
like 5,627 towns.

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.720
Towns were often
at the intersection

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.435
of important points.

00:28:21.435 --> 00:28:29.640
Her empire stretched
from Scotland to Slovakia

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:36.390
to the Middle East
to North Africa.

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:39.060
Again, some of the same
phenomena occurred.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:43.740
Timgad, the great Roman
town in North Africa,

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.990
is a town for veterans.

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:48.630
It's subdivided
into equal blocks

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:52.520
to repay veterans for service.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:57.450
There are two characteristics
of a Roman town.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.465
Again, the same phenomenon
of the commercial order,

00:29:00.465 --> 00:29:03.450
of an international
commercial order,

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:08.420
creating the logic for formal
order or local formal order.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:16.650
Germanicus, the
Roman, general says,

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:19.890
"I can feel I'm
still in Rome if I

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:24.660
journey from London or the
beginning of London, Londinium,

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.380
to Rome."

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:34.200
The poet Rutilius Namatianus
says, "a city of the far flung

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.880
Earth you have made."

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.180
So there are two compunctions
in the Roman city.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:43.470
The one is to create a locus,
a place of significance,

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:45.150
much like a camp.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:50.460
For that already the
connections to the space outside

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.965
of the town is made by
emphasizing the Cardo

00:29:53.965 --> 00:29:54.840
and Decumanus system.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:04.850
We have the Greek town,
much like the magical town

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:05.360
before it.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.060
It was an isolated
phenomenon sitting

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:16.610
on often very complex territory,
and building a wall which

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:18.780
fitted the territory's form.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:29.590
And although there may be a port
here, as in the case of Priene,

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:34.480
there was no attempt to
connect this to anything else.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.925
There was no empire
large enough.

00:30:36.925 --> 00:30:48.620
The Roman town was
an empire town.

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:57.090
The Cardo and Decumanus
centralized in a forum

00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:03.010
and was an version of
an encampment which

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:05.330
could be built anywhere.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.560
It's the basis of London,
it's the basis of Paris,

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.860
it's the basis of
Bratislava, it's

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:20.130
the basis of 5,000 settlements.

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:32.320
That's A. And we call
this castrametation,

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.320
a nominal phenomenon.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:40.750
That is to logically extend
the marking of the territory

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.490
outside the town.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:44.170
This is called centuriation.

00:31:48.274 --> 00:31:52.060
Sorry, you can't read my
handwriting-- castrametation,

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.680
centuriation.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:32:04.440
That is the measuring of land
outside the town by a surveying

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:11.040
technique using a gromaticus,
a manual on utility

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:17.590
needs how to lay
out parcels of land.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:25.080
These were both used for
agricultural purposes

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:29.520
and also as payment for service.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:41.600
So the hermetic quality of
the Greek colonial settlement

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.020
is quite different in spirit.

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:51.955
Every crossing was a town.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:10.400
The notion of being
the center of a empire

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.920
is different than the
metaphysics of being

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:17.180
the center of the Earth.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.760
The one is provable,
the one is not provable.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:24.470
The one is metaphysical,
as in the cosmic model.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:28.370
You'll remember my
quoting Vassiliadis

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:37.610
regarding the centeredness
of the archaic world.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:46.260
The centeredness
here is the linking.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.940
Of course, the center of
Rome, with all its fora

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:57.560
and magnificence, was the
center of a fundamental system

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.980
of financial distribution.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:03.350
The Roman Empire was
built on physicality.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:09.199
That is, on the learning how
to tax people locally, and then

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:12.900
feed the money back
into a central place.

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:17.900
This is the first model
of colonial enterprise.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:22.250
You find some wonderful
reactions to it.

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:27.679
Bellini's opera Norma--
has anybody seen Norma?

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.810
You should see Norma.

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:32.750
Norma is the story of
the Roman occupation

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.659
of the capital city of Gaul.

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:42.000
And Norma is the
local woman who leads

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.330
the revolt against the Romans.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:48.139
She of course falls in love
with a Roman lieutenant.

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:54.980
And both of them disappear
into the God only knows what.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:03.650
Or if you want another
invocation of the Roman city,

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:08.990
read Shakespeare's
play Coriolanus.

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:15.860
Coriolanus is a bad Roman
and he suffers on his attempt

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:20.270
to return to Rome to
his mother center,

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:25.460
but fails in his attempt.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.430
OK, there's a lot to be
said about the Romans.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:45.710
The territory subdivided by the
gromaticus is generally 6 by 6,

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:48.050
or 36 units.

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:50.630
And this is the
circumference of land

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:52.940
plowed by one ox in one day.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.460
I'm wanting to go through
this very quickly because we

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.880
have to look at some images
and there's no point.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:10.170
I'm only trying to make a
central an argument as I

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:13.080
can about each case.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.970
One of the arguments
I'm not making

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:19.380
is the influence of materials.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:23.640
The Romans were the first
people to invent concrete.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.420
And the public quality
of the Roman city

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:32.190
is ascribed to the
availability of concrete.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.090
For those of you
interested, there's

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:39.450
is a piece by an MIT
Professor, Heather Lechtman

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:45.210
called Roman Concrete and the
Roman Architecture Revolution.

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:50.880
She argues that
hydraulic setting cement

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.690
was an attractive ceramic
medium for a period buildings.

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:57.870
These could be processed
at ambient temperatures

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.960
from readily available
raw ingredients

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.585
and cast into large,
designated spaces.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.780
It produced integral
monolithic structures,

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:13.530
which could be
incrementally extended.

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:17.880
The Greeks had to meet
in the open space.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.580
The Jews still meet
in the open space

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:24.540
up against the Western
Wall against the remnants

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.195
of Herod's Temple.

00:37:27.195 --> 00:37:29.460
The Romans for the
first time made

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:36.370
it possible to enclose
space and convert the spaces

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:40.410
is no larger than about six
feet enormities corridor

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:45.120
is a very concrete phenomenon.

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.870
The Pantheon is an example.

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.660
But Lechtman doesn't only
refer to the Pantheon.

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:55.500
She refers to the aqueducts,
to the whole system

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:59.160
of building public buildings
at the scale that they did.

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.365
The Greeks weren't
great builders.

00:38:01.365 --> 00:38:02.675
They were aesthetes.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:12.440
There's a thesis last year by
Daniele Cappelletti who argues

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:16.340
that the Romans enabled the
beginning of what he called

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.410
[INAUDIBLE] architecture--

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:20.720
that is, the interior
of buildings.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.360
The Greeks weren't
interested in interiors--

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:27.986
they were exterior,
externalizers.

00:38:27.986 --> 00:38:31.750
A plan of the agora
doesn't follow any access.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:37.010
It's a jumble of things,
much like the Mayan town.

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:41.330
If you devote yourself to
creating buildings which only

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:44.780
makes sense given the
exterior, what they can see

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:54.080
or how they can be seen, you
can deviate from the model

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.595
that the Romans used.

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:02.630
The post-Roman period,
we call the Middle Ages.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:09.620
In my learning of history,
these were the Dark Ages.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:12.050
Nothing happened--
the world only

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:19.070
emerged after a period of
immense turmoil in Europe.

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:28.070
There's been recent history done
on this period from 300 to 900

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:35.495
AD, from 400 to 880 AD,
to mention two new books.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:44.170
There's not too much to be said.

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:51.600
The Roman system was
localized in every respect.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.230
Large families and the
church took over sites

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:59.940
from Roman camps.

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:06.720
The fiscal system-- there wasn't
a centralized economy funding

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:11.400
taxation into Rome,
so each set up

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:14.130
a competitive system for towns.

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:19.620
One of the things that
the Roman roads did

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:26.710
was to allow the subsequent
cultures to use the system

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:31.650
of moving large distances.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:35.760
The Christian Church
took advantage of this.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:46.260
In the story of [INAUDIBLE]
what's the town in the--

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:55.230
my mind has slipped--

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:57.720
the town I wrote about
in the first reading?

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:06.200
It's [INAUDIBLE] one of the
saintly cities in Northern

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.867
Spain, [INAUDIBLE] named--

00:41:09.867 --> 00:41:10.700
AUDIENCE: Compostela

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:12.080
JULIAN BEINART: Compostela.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:13.970
Of course, it's
named after James.

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:19.220
It's got the same name as San
Diego and all of the-- sorry,

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:22.460
I try to remember too much.

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:31.490
Pilgrimage was made possible
by virtue of the Roman roads,

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:36.920
so was in medieval
connections in commerce.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:44.210
A pilgrim could come to
Compostela from Bulgaria,

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:51.320
walk or take a donkey,
move through France

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.650
where they would stay
in religious hostels,

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:58.040
eat Coquilles
Saint-Jacques, which

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:04.760
is the food which emanates from
Compostela, because Compostela

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:12.050
is a signature in the scallop,
much like shell petroleum.

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:17.135
It adopted the scallop
as its important logo.

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:26.360
I think the first
post-medieval notion

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:31.580
of the machine-like
phenomenon occurs

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:36.890
with the expansion
in the 13th century

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:40.640
of the French Bastide towns.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:53.510
Bastides is B-A-S-T-I-D-E-S.
In the 13th century,

00:42:53.510 --> 00:43:01.210
the Central Royal Authority
built something like 177 new

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:07.430
towns in the French
territory in the south.

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:14.950
Between 1241 and
1330, you have towns

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:20.560
like Carcassonne, Beauvais,
Montpensier, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:26.920
These settlers who were asked
to come and populate these towns

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:31.980
were there because of the
French authority's wish

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:35.620
to propose to defend,
imposed their will

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.680
on the distant
parts of the empire.

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.390
They also developed
as markets centers.

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:46.270
A grid of convenience,
the quickest

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:52.150
and most equitable way of
laying out a town on a new site.

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:55.780
The form of these towns
is also grid-like.

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:59.800
The plan differs in some
fundamental respects.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.940
The plan is a formal order
which is generally orthogonal.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:08.920
But the plan, it doesn't
follow the Roman preoccupation

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.750
with a single axis.

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:12.545
It pairs roads.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:32.160
This is the central square.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:41.130
And where the road passes
through the central square,

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:42.315
it is arcaded.

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:57.820
The church is generally
located on a side site.

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:07.720
These sites was subdivided
in grid fashion.

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:13.870
There's a gate here, a gate
here, there's a gate here,

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:15.190
and there's a gate here.

00:45:18.557 --> 00:45:23.660
And the same impulse to make
it attractive for people

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:30.830
to migrate, to pay them for the
effort of migration, the state

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:36.110
takes on the role of building
the walls, and so on.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.290
Has any of you been
to a town like this?

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:49.060
Which town do you remember?

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.815
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:51.815 --> 00:45:53.400
JULIAN BEINART:
Well, Montpensier

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.960
is probably the best known.

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.695
It has the most developed
system of arcades.

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:10.080
If you have any chance to
visit Montpensier, do so.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.250
The wine is good.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.600
The arcades are called cornier.

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.930
And the subdivision
of the land is

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:31.220
called in French it's
referred to as checkers.

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:38.600
And popular game checkers
has similar notation,

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:42.830
formal notation, as
the layout of the town.

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:45.050
By the way, Winston
Churchill's house

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:47.180
was named Checkers as well.

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:50.195
Haven't the faintest idea
why, but it's amusing.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:47:02.380
The largest decentralization
after the Roman

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:07.630
occurs in the Spanish
occupation of Latin America

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:09.540
and the southern part
of the United States.

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:48.340
This is about a crude
a generalization as one

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:52.840
could make, but I'll try.

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:55.930
In 1494, the Meridian
of Tordesillas

00:47:55.930 --> 00:48:04.110
is divided Latin America
into Portuguese domain

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:05.220
and the Spanish domain.

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:17.110
The Laws of the Indies
applies to this domain here

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:20.800
and also to this domain
here, which was part

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.410
of South America at the time.

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:30.760
We'll talk about the
grid of expediency here

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:33.070
and the cattaneo model here.

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:45.970
C-A-T-T-A-N-E-O-- New
Haven, Savannah, Charleston.

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:52.180
Let's makes
generalizations about them.

00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:07.060
In 1573, Philip
II, understanding

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:13.840
the military, religious, and
financial availability of land

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:18.790
in the hinterland
of the Americas,

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:23.740
created an argument or set
of principles on which towns

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.210
would be laid out.

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:29.005
These are called in English
the Laws of the Indies.

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:47.650
They describe the way you are
set of rules which specify--

00:49:51.480 --> 00:50:00.145
I'd better hurry-- the size
of the individual components

00:50:00.145 --> 00:50:00.645
of the town.

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:05.460
The main plaza
was to be oriented

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:08.040
so its four corners
pointed to the four

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.245
cardinal points of a compass.

00:50:10.245 --> 00:50:14.490
It shall not be smaller
than 200 feet wide

00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:19.680
and 300 feet long, no larger
than 800 feet long, and so on.

00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:27.900
It had a formal
message to convey

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:32.850
to the Indians who located
around where the new settlement

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:35.910
tool place.

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:39.060
"When the Indians see them, they
will be filled with wonder."

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:42.510
That is the church.

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:46.620
The Indians should not
be let into this town

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:49.230
until the church is finished.

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:53.820
The church architecture
represents the formal attribute

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:56.000
of colonial superiority.

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:01.430
The Indians must understand
that they have been conquered

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:05.750
by a superior race,
therefore the church,

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:10.040
which is to the
Spanish the highest

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:15.950
form of contact with God and
the only formal attribute

00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:20.510
that we have other than
behavior and ritual,

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:26.670
becomes the temple of
the Roman town, at least

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:28.175
to the Laws of the Indies town.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:44.180
St. Augustine, Florida
was the first application

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:48.540
of the Laws of the
Indies in 1565.

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:55.550
Los Angeles was the last of
the Spanish settlements, 1781.

00:51:55.550 --> 00:52:00.770
So the period of
this 1565 to 1781

00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:07.040
takes care of many of
the towns, St. Augustine.

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:11.240
The Anglo-American grid, which
is the grid of experience

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:18.140
to the North, overlaps with
the Laws of the Indies grid

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:20.570
in towns like Albuquerque.

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:26.810
If you want to look further
into how this structure works

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:31.025
when the two collide, I'll
give you the reference.

00:52:31.025 --> 00:52:33.530
It's a piece written
by an ex-student

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:38.540
from this class published
a number of years ago.

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:46.130
The Portuguese Empire
was left to develop

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:49.800
according to a pattern different
from the Spanish towns.

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:53.550
The Portuguese
Empire was casual.

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:58.200
It really spent
most of its presence

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:02.040
in the Iberian Peninsula
looking outwards and being

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:10.440
dramatic, reoriented, and
conquering the sea routes.

00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:13.860
Sao Paulo, which is now one
of the world's largest cities,

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:17.040
one of the few 20
million-person cities,

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:20.010
has its origin in
nothing more than three

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:25.860
different religious sects
forming the town on a hill

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:27.780
away from the water.

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:30.910
Sao Paulo should have
been on the water.

00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:36.000
These people made a
mistake, and in competition

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.940
with each other set up
three points of growth

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:45.390
in central Sao Paulo.

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:47.355
AUDIENCE: How do
the Law of Indies

00:53:47.355 --> 00:53:49.835
apply to a city
like Mexico City,

00:53:49.835 --> 00:53:53.321
because it was actually
kind of established.

00:53:53.321 --> 00:53:54.480
JULIAN BEINART: It adapted.

00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:01.470
Most of these
generalizations and rules

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:12.480
are systems of order which have
to compete with the existing

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:13.680
structure.

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.500
The Greek town, had
it been in the desert,

00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:19.600
would have been paid
less attention to it.

00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:23.190
The Egyptian town,
being on the flat land,

00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:24.840
didn't deal with topography.

00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:30.340
The story of Mexico
is a long story,

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:32.406
and I haven't got time
unfortunately to--

00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:37.290
maybe I can send you
an email about it.

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:39.900
But the story of Mexico City.

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:40.857
Where are you from.

00:54:40.857 --> 00:54:41.940
AUDIENCE: I'm from Mexico.

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:42.857
JULIAN BEINART: Where?

00:54:42.857 --> 00:54:44.760
AUDIENCE: So I know
the story of Mexico.

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:48.240
What I'm trying to
understand is how

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:53.650
it deviated from one
standardized town

00:54:53.650 --> 00:54:55.190
the photos and another.

00:55:00.782 --> 00:55:06.110
JULIAN BEINART: It followed
it as best it could.

00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:08.990
One needs to look
at Bogota or Quito

00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:10.880
to find much more pure example--

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:14.330
I'm sure both Bogota
and Quito are much purer

00:55:14.330 --> 00:55:18.140
examples of building
new towns on the basis

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.790
of little competition.

00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:21.960
Mexico City was unusual.

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.635
Most of the Laws of the
Indies towns were new towns.

00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:34.280
OK, let's jump.

00:55:47.450 --> 00:56:03.600
The amount of time
left for discussing

00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:08.730
the influences on the laying
out of most of Central--

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:12.510
not Central America,
Central and North America--

00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:16.860
can be found in books by
John Rep's Town Planning

00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:21.030
in Frontier America,
a number of texts.

00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:26.790
One of the best that I would
refer to is Conzen's writing.

00:56:26.790 --> 00:56:28.860
The reference isn't
in this class,

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:31.590
it's for class number 24.

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:36.300
Conzen, a British
geographer, has

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:39.610
written very excellent stuff.

00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:45.250
Essentially the components
of the grid of expediency

00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:46.650
are the following--

00:56:46.650 --> 00:56:50.250
number 1, the Land
Ordinance of 1785

00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:55.320
which divided the unbuilt
parts of the United States,

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:58.570
first only part of
it, then finally

00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:04.410
most of the United States,
into a grid of 6 by 6 miles.

00:57:04.410 --> 00:57:08.070
Local authorities or
local towns could then

00:57:08.070 --> 00:57:10.890
subdivide within this grid.

00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:17.400
Most of the subdivision was
taken care of by two forces,

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:21.630
either private development,
which subdivided length

00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:30.600
into smaller units, or the
railroad companies which

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:34.260
merged [INAUDIBLE] develop
[INAUDIBLE] profits

00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:36.420
hand-in-hand.

00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:40.050
The standard plan used
by railroads for 33 towns

00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:44.400
developed by one group
alone in Illinois.

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:46.440
There was another
force at work, and that

00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:51.240
was the movement of religious
groups such as the Mormons

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:53.190
across this country.

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:57.930
There were Mormons starting
in 1913 up in New York.

00:57:57.930 --> 00:58:02.690
They moved to a Kirkland, Ohio,
they were pushed out of there.

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:05.970
They move to Missouri,
the revelation

00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:08.430
that this is the new place.

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:10.350
They moved out of there.

00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:15.900
They went to Nauvoo in Illinois
and spent the winter quarters

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.630
in 1847 in Nebraska.

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:24.450
And finally in 1847, after
a journey of 17 years,

00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:27.900
Brigham Young said,
this is the place

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:31.350
and he developed Salt Lake City.

00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:37.500
Salt Lake City is a grid city,
which has a set of micro-rules

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:38.880
about street--

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:42.660
which lots can be facing
the streets, and so on.

00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:46.215
I'll talk about that later.

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:59.440
Two people who've argued
about the grid of expediency--

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:02.650
Lewis Mumford has
called urban land

00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:07.180
becoming a mere commodity
by the parceling of land

00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:11.090
a quick conversion of
farmstead into real estate

00:59:11.090 --> 00:59:14.050
and a quick sale.

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:18.920
Richard Sennett has written
in the Conscience of the Eye

00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:22.570
about the Protestant
ethic of being

00:59:22.570 --> 00:59:28.690
satisfied with what he calls
the Protestant ethic of space.

00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:31.690
"Here is where the
good found its place.

00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:34.570
It was a space for
economic competition

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:36.910
to be played upon
like a chessboard.

00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:40.540
It was a space of neutrality,
and neutrality achieved

00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:45.780
by denying to the environment
any value of its own."

00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:52.210
This attempt to
argue in this way

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:58.030
argues that, if I
buy any IBM share,

00:59:58.030 --> 01:00:00.160
I buy a piece of
its typewriters--

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.590
I don't know if they
still makes them--

01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:06.820
a piece of real estate,
a piece of its land.

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:13.210
My $5 share, or $47
share, is a commodity

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:17.080
as a reduction of a
large complex whole.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:20.620
The argument is that the
city is a complex whole.

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:24.790
And reducing it to a
commodity by gridding it

01:00:24.790 --> 01:00:29.870
takes no account of the
essential qualities of a city.

01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:35.410
There's a kind of cosmic memory
associated with his critique.

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:42.370
How capitalism developed
Boston with no grid

01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:45.060
is, of course, a question
I would ask Richard Sennett

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:46.120
or Lewis Mumford.

01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:52.200
Not all American cities
were like Chicago.

01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:03.660
The cattaneo of cities
on the East Coast,

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.520
I have got time to--

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.710
but they essentially
are best described

01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:13.050
by the Plan of Savannah, written
very elegantly in an analysis

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:16.590
by Stanford Anderson, who's
a Professor in the Department

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:18.030
of Architecture.

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:21.060
It essentially
takes the grid plan

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:26.220
and centers it
into neighborhoods

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:28.350
with parks in the center.

01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:32.460
It divides the road
system into wider roads

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:34.500
which run north-south.

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:39.180
Why do the roads in Manhattan
are wider, 100 feet wide,

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:43.170
going north-south, and 50
feet wide going east-west?

01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:50.540
What are the roads
connecting in the Rome sense?

01:01:53.720 --> 01:02:00.180
Docks, water traffic on
either side of the island.

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:03.200
So the east-west street
should have been wider

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.590
than the north-south street.

01:02:05.590 --> 01:02:09.225
The north-south are avenues.

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:09.725
Why?

01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:14.540
Let's try to answer
that question

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:19.640
in talking about the 1811 Plan.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:24.590
The 1811 Plan was
no cosmic plan.

01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:27.260
According to Roy
Strickland's writing,

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:29.720
it simply adapted
the measurements

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:34.310
of the British
settlement, which took

01:02:34.310 --> 01:02:42.630
over the Dutch original
1623 settlement.

01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:46.590
There was a wonderful exhibition
of the 1811 Plan in New York

01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:47.770
last year.

01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:49.950
I don't know if
any of you saw it.

01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:52.200
Did you see it?

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.260
Pretty.

01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:58.430
It says more than
I can possibly say.

01:02:58.430 --> 01:03:04.280
In the commissioner's
report, it says,

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.665
"we could not bear in
mind that a city is

01:03:06.665 --> 01:03:10.370
to compose principally of
the habitations of men,

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:13.610
and that straight-sided
and right-angled houses

01:03:13.610 --> 01:03:18.960
are the most cheap to build and
the most convenient to live in,

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.480
effective these plain and simple
reflections are decisive."

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:36.400
So here we have a plan which
many people have commented on,

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:42.766
a plan which is allowed enormous
subdivisional specialization,

01:03:42.766 --> 01:03:46.720
a plan which has allowed
the southern sector to grow

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.730
as a financial center.

01:03:48.730 --> 01:03:55.910
A central part is a part
for department stores,

01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:59.710
the combination of
housing and offices

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:05.275
and commerce in the
rest of the plan.

01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:13.450
Essentially, it's a plan which
[INAUDIBLE] has correctly

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:18.370
written about as delirious.

01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:23.920
One of the advantages
of a free system.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:28.030
There have been rules about
building a Manhattan ever

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:31.771
since, the protection
of the sidewalks--

01:04:31.771 --> 01:04:33.700
the height at
which buildings get

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:36.430
build, and so on, over time.

01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:40.180
But the central
grid has remained.

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:44.290
It is fundamental to the
grid system of New York

01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:47.335
that Central Park
connects east and west.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:53.990
The grid system is the
fundamental flexibility

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:57.150
phenomenon of Manhattan.

01:04:57.150 --> 01:05:00.530
And it coupled with
the combination

01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:08.280
of income and density
produces a unique situation

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:13.710
which we will examine more
carefully later in this class.

01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:17.340
But could Manhattan be developed
on a different principle

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:18.150
than a grid?

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:23.600
That's asking a big question.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.490
We'd have to do
different plans for that

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:31.130
and try to assemble the
conjecture that follows.

01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:34.940
We're not doing it, and
it's ridiculous to do it.

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:37.010
The lessons from
Manhattan are to be

01:05:37.010 --> 01:05:41.870
learned by virtue of
reading the original plan

01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:45.050
and studying the
attempts to modify it.

01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:52.850
It like many-- how are we doing?

01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:58.700
Two minutes-- like
many city plans,

01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:01.130
is in a constant
state of adaptation.

01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:08.800
The Second Avenue
Subway is the last

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:13.160
of the most recent of
the distortions of--

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:16.580
not the distortions,
that adaptations

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:20.210
to the plan, the attempt to--

01:06:22.850 --> 01:06:27.710
Rowe Price Manhattan
failed, it's probably

01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:31.660
likely to occur at sometime.

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:37.490
The impossibility of connecting
the hinterland to the center

01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:41.600
is evidenced by the
fact that New York, one

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.660
of the primary commercial
cities of the world,

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:51.770
has the worst international
airport system of any city

01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:53.870
competitively.

01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:56.360
It's only the
arrogance of New York

01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:00.090
that let's it get away with
having a second rate airport

01:07:00.090 --> 01:07:00.590
system.

01:07:04.874 --> 01:07:10.670
Those of who have experienced
LaGuardia and Kennedy and New

01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:15.590
Jersey and have been
to great, new airports

01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:19.130
can argue for yourselves
the distinction.

01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:26.600
Carnegie Hall is one of the
most uncomfortable places

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.820
to listen to great music.

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:32.570
Again, New York gets
away through a kind

01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:34.890
of economic arrogance.

01:07:34.890 --> 01:07:39.230
The theory, which is highly
personal to me, that is,

01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:42.830
if you develop enough
economic strength,

01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:49.040
you need not follow it by
making everything of the highest

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.520
order.

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.670
It's a stupid phenomenon,
but maybe it's true.

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:58.600
It's only in China, which
has new wealth, that people

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:02.570
can build new airports.

01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:05.280
It's of course not totally true.

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:13.700
But one of the major concerns
about the additive quality

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:20.210
of the Chinese city is that
it is a city of addition

01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:25.550
and has lost any of the
attributes of the cosmos

01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:30.529
or even the Roman camp.

01:08:30.529 --> 01:08:32.960
We will go into that some more.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.240
The last group of
slides will deal

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:41.840
with the evocation of linearity
and more modern concepts

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:45.350
of the use of the
idea of the machine.

01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:48.649
So why don't we look at them,
otherwise we will just go on.

01:08:48.649 --> 01:08:50.000
This is a long class.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.980
This is an enormous
amount of stuff.

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:01.689
I don't apologize for
these first three classes.

01:09:01.689 --> 01:09:05.229
Most you haven't done
enough urban history.

01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:06.670
Here are two examples.

01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:09.720
The one on the right
is from Tell el-Armana.

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:21.100
The one on the left is from
Kahun 2460 BC and 320 BC.

01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:21.600
Next.

01:09:25.649 --> 01:09:28.080
This is the town
of Tell el-Amarna

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:32.500
on the east side of the Nile
built by the Pharaoh Akhenaten

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:36.090
and occupied for only 40 years.

01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:39.930
He had a religious argument
with the priest in Thebes

01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:43.350
and went across the Nile
to build his new town.

01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:51.479
The yellow in the plan
refers to the workers lair.

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:55.140
There's another story,
which I haven't got time

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:58.590
much to go into that.

01:09:58.590 --> 01:10:03.240
In Freud's writing
about Moses, the book

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.220
is called Moses
and Monotheism, he

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:11.580
talks about the connection
between pharaonic Egypt

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:16.560
and the emergence of
Palestine, the sum notion

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:21.550
that this land for Jerusalem
is taken from the Dead Sea

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:22.050
Scrolls.

01:10:25.290 --> 01:10:31.230
The sum notion that there
was some connection passing

01:10:31.230 --> 01:10:34.260
on information
from the Jevasites,

01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:38.490
the first occupiers of
Jerusalem, or one of the first,

01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:40.410
and the Egyptians.

01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:40.910
Next.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:47.220
The Greek town, Miletus--

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:49.600
Miletus, you can
see the structure

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:50.850
of the containing wall.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:58.340
The orange and darker colors
of the imposition of the Romans

01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:00.440
on top of the Greek plan.

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:02.750
Next.

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:13.060
OK, Priene, the
main axes roads--

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:17.500
again north-south with
minor roads east-west,

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:23.350
and the central agora
complex and temple complex

01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:28.230
and part of the central
parts of the town.

01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:34.110
The Roman road system, an
extraordinary phenomenon.

01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:39.360
Just imagine at
the birth of Christ

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:42.850
or a couple of hundred
years afterwards

01:11:42.850 --> 01:11:47.820
that there'd be an empire
built as significantly

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:48.840
connected as this.

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:54.000
This gives some indication
of the location of the Roman

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:54.900
towns--

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:59.215
5,627 according
to one authority.

01:11:59.215 --> 01:11:59.715
Next.

01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:07.710
castrametation, the
idea of the town

01:12:07.710 --> 01:12:11.550
as being cemented by
two connecting roads,

01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:17.220
a fortification
around the outskirts,

01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:22.140
and the notion of a
gridded system outside.

01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:25.680
It takes an enormous
amount of thought

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.060
to imagine a town which
has a fortification having

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:33.720
a counterpart formal
order outside the town.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.520
That is unique to the Romans.

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:41.040
They were so conscious of
the clarity of the empire

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:47.880
that they could imagine
making the land--

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:53.670
again, the land as opposed to
the city in marks, the land

01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:55.980
as a friend of the city.

01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:58.668
Next.

01:12:58.668 --> 01:13:03.920
Here is the 6 by 6 system
of land subdivision

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:10.520
for an ox which can
perambulate in one day

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:18.010
the layout made by a [INAUDIBLE]
at the hands of a gromaticus.

01:13:18.010 --> 01:13:22.210
Here near [INAUDIBLE]
in Central Italy,

01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:27.620
you can see some of the effects
even today of the length

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:31.890
of the centuriation pattern.

01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:36.570
The city is only in
existence in its relationship

01:13:36.570 --> 01:13:43.110
to this space outside it as it
is condensed in its interior.

01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:44.470
It's a phenomenal idea.

01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:50.070
It's an idea which
American cities have not,

01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:54.370
or modern cities, have
not understood completely.

01:13:54.370 --> 01:13:54.870
Next.

01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:03.920
Timgad, the great Roman city
for veterans on North Africa.

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:07.220
The Cardo and Decumanus
here are shortened

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:11.280
because of the location of the
forum and the amphitheater.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:11.780
Next.

01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:20.800
Two plans-- Verona on the
right and the first attempt

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:29.830
in a relatively Renaissance plan
of Florence based on attempts

01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:33.040
to introduce a local
taxation system

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:36.305
and still respecting
the Roman grid.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:36.805
Next.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.500
The southwest of France--

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:45.390
the Bastide town,
a pair of towns.

01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:48.540
The cornier in the center,
the church on the side.

01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:49.040
Next.

01:14:51.896 --> 01:14:56.230
[SPEAKING FRENCH] Here you
see something interesting

01:14:56.230 --> 01:14:57.700
geometrically.

01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:02.010
The blocks as they go
further from the center

01:15:02.010 --> 01:15:05.140
have the horizontal length
based on the diagonal

01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:07.120
of the previous.

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:11.335
So the blocks get
bigger as you go out.

01:15:11.335 --> 01:15:13.992
It's a geometric trick.

01:15:13.992 --> 01:15:16.730
Here it is.

01:15:16.730 --> 01:15:19.430
Next.

01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:26.120
[INAUDIBLE] the great
town on the Mediterranean,

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.980
clearly in prismatic.

01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:30.290
This served is one
of the launching

01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:37.370
points for many crusades
to Christianize Jerusalem.

01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:41.450
And here's [INAUDIBLE]
one of the roads running

01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:44.660
through the central
plaza, a cornier

01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:49.190
system of creating
a greater pedestrian

01:15:49.190 --> 01:15:51.830
opportunity in the center.

01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:56.325
It's like building a permanent
arcade around the center.

01:15:56.325 --> 01:15:56.825
Next.

01:15:59.630 --> 01:16:02.060
Here's the Meridian
of Tordesillas--

01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:05.690
the Spanish world and
the North American world.

01:16:05.690 --> 01:16:09.020
Here's a typical Laws
of the Indies town.

01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:12.930
I think it's Caracas
central plaza.

01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:13.430
Next.

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:25.060
In contrast, the development
of the typical Portuguese town,

01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:28.180
as you can see from
its early stages,

01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:31.025
has developed long strips.

01:16:31.025 --> 01:16:31.525
Next.

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:40.580
Again, this is-- thank you.

01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:44.000
This is a thesis done
on examining the Laws

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.380
of the Indies in detail.

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:52.310
It's a thesis here at MIT
by Guillermo Frontado.

01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:56.900
He looks at the
streets at the plazas

01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:00.260
and interprets the
laws in formal terms--

01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:05.055
what distances they occupy,
what sections they produce,

01:17:05.055 --> 01:17:06.630
and so on.

01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:07.130
Next.

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:14.020
So here is the
subsequent development

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:19.960
of two central capital
Latin American cities based

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.130
on the Laws of the Indies.

01:17:21.130 --> 01:17:25.660
Here are the major churches
on the central plaza.

01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:30.940
Here you see the adaptation
of the central plaza

01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:35.440
theme in subsequent
decentralized plazas.

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:35.940
Next.

01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:49.260
Subdivision of the 6
by 6 mile 1785 system.

01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:49.760
Next.

01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:57.610
Salt Lake City,
Harrington, Kansas--

01:17:57.610 --> 01:17:59.540
built the railway company.

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:00.040
Next.

01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:08.720
Chicago, which we'll deal
with in some detail later on.

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:16.400
And Burnham's Plan
1907, 1905 Plan

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:23.250
to centralize the
grid of Chicago.

01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:28.380
It's an extraordinary
plan, diagonalizing

01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:31.740
the grid towards the center.

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:35.905
It's kind of attempt
cosmetize Chicago.

01:18:35.905 --> 01:18:36.405
Next.

01:18:39.650 --> 01:18:43.490
1811 Plan.

01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:46.280
Again, this is out of focus.

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.740
Now, why then change this.

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:54.060
The story of Central
Park is another story.

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:55.280
Next.

01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:00.410
The inevitable connections
of the east and west,

01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:04.280
maintaining the grid,
while still producing

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.870
a major public garden.

01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:07.370
Next.

01:19:10.330 --> 01:19:18.310
The cattaneo model-- that
is, dispersing open space

01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:22.180
throughout the system and
having different widths of roads

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:23.710
is part of the system.

01:19:23.710 --> 01:19:24.730
Next.

01:19:24.730 --> 01:19:32.150
Savannah, Georgia--
still a marvelous town,

01:19:32.150 --> 01:19:35.610
and a town which resisted here.

01:19:35.610 --> 01:19:38.720
There's a book called
the Night of Garden.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:39.890
What's the book?

01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:43.600
Anybody know the book?

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:47.680
Which talks about
Savannah's decision

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:52.300
not to take large companies,
like insurance companies

01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:55.090
as headquarters because
of their attempt

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:57.260
to keep the local system.

01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:57.760
Next.

01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:02.540
And a few of the
modern examples.

01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:05.250
This is Soria y Mata,
the Spaniard's plan

01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:12.420
for linearizing the outskirts
of Madrid, a linear model being

01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:15.630
a very popular model,
taken essentially

01:20:15.630 --> 01:20:18.715
from a mass fabrication system.

01:20:18.715 --> 01:20:19.215
Next.

01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:29.670
[INAUDIBLE] the affirming
steed, the magnificent steed,

01:20:29.670 --> 01:20:31.020
the superb steed.

01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:35.410
The engine of the express
train, the steam engine

01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:38.220
which people went to see.

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:42.570
And the Ascoral Plan,
which Corbusier was one of,

01:20:42.570 --> 01:20:51.880
1940, a plan to link
Europe, to linearize Europe.

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:52.380
Next.

01:20:56.420 --> 01:21:00.740
Captain [? Chambliss's ?]
plan for linking New York

01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:08.510
and Washington with a
public train system that

01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:10.400
had an effect on
the local-- that

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:15.020
fed off the agricultural
land next to it.

01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:19.340
Somebody called it a
horizontal skyscraper.

01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:24.860
Kenzo Tange's 1960 plan
for the linearizing Tokyo

01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:28.820
and creating a greater use
of the harbor, of the water.

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:31.630
Next.

01:21:31.630 --> 01:21:38.500
Stupid plans like this by Jonah
Friedman to linearize Paris.

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:41.470
Absolute madness--
should lock people up.

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:46.180
Next.

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:53.930
The fascination with
bringing together

01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:56.570
a number of mechanical forces--

01:21:56.570 --> 01:22:03.590
train, bus, pedestrian,
and the many schemas

01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:09.710
for maximizing
density in New York.

01:22:09.710 --> 01:22:14.840
The stupidity of the
Archigram proposal for moving.

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:18.770
Archigram would have
worked very well in Egypt

01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:21.830
where you had no investment
in permanent sites,

01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:23.660
but you moved around.

01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:27.530
This is the grasshopper
city, which moves around.

01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:29.870
If there's anything we've
learned historically,

01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:34.790
that the inertia of
cities in modern times

01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:37.670
maintains this position.

01:22:37.670 --> 01:22:41.870
I've said this before, that you
can count the number of cities.

01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:44.360
There are cities in
trouble like Detroit,

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:49.460
but there's no disappearance
of cities, or very few,

01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:52.455
compared to previous times.

01:22:52.455 --> 01:22:52.955
Next.

01:22:56.980 --> 01:23:00.300
It's called Buckminster
Fuller and notion

01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:04.230
of using a single
machine to cover

01:23:04.230 --> 01:23:06.760
the whole of the
city of Manhattan.

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:07.260
Next.

01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:12.710
I think we end here.

01:23:12.710 --> 01:23:15.400
This is Lord
Behrens' proposition

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:18.610
for the AEG factory--

01:23:18.610 --> 01:23:21.760
just about done--
in Berlin showing

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:27.340
the wonderful correct place
for every worker in the system.

01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:36.130
And here the nightmare of Soweto
outside Johannesburg, or part

01:23:36.130 --> 01:23:40.240
of Johannesburg,
where race created

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:47.290
a new town in which the
machine model is exemplified

01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:50.470
par excellence
with no pretension

01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:55.630
paid to anything else but
the disposition of houses

01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:57.800
in free space.

01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.350
OK.
