WEBVTT

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.380
PROFESSOR: So now
let's use the results

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.980
of our probabilistic
model of transmission

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.870
to see how we can
modify our safety

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.140
guideline to take into account
different risk scenarios.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.680
So our general result is
that the expected number

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.580
of transmissions in the
room in a given time

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.730
is given by the expected
number of infected times

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.700
susceptible times
the mean transmission

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.240
rate, which is the average
beta times the time.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.500
And we want this less to
be than some tolerance.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.750
And also, given the
various approximations

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.820
we've made where,
for example, we

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.260
have not let the number
of susceptibles change--

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.290
people can be infected
more than once,

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.710
and we've neglected
various aspects

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.650
of the model in that way--
this should typically

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.860
be assumed less than 1.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.910
So we're always kind of
thinking of transmission

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.290
of being a rare event.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.710
If we have lots
of infected people

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.360
in the room, lots of
transmission going on,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.820
that's a more
complicated situation

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.530
which requires more
sophisticated models.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.080
But for purpose of
guidelines, this is the limit

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.390
that we want to think about.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.160
But the different
scenarios correspond

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.200
to our different
assumptions about I and S.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.150
So first, I'll just
remind you of what

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.130
we've been doing until now,
which is to limit spreading

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.160
of the epidemic as a whole.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.280
Thinking what if every
indoor space were

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.810
to impose the guideline, we're
really thinking of the case

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.560
where I is 1, and
S is N minus 1,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.830
and then this expected
number of transmissions

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.009
is just the indoor reproductive
number, which is, of course,

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.170
just N minus 1 times beta
tau is less than epsilon.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.920
So that's the guideline
that we've already

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.420
been talking about because the I
and the S here are now actually

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.140
no longer random.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.790
We're just saying let's just
consider that situation.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.250
And if everybody
does that, then we

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.590
are limiting the spread
of the disease overall

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.250
and should be
hopefully fighting it.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.990
What we'd like to
talk about here

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.230
is how to start with this kind
of a restriction which gives us

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.970
certain bounds on occupancy,
ventilation, and other factors

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.690
and think about,
well, how would we

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.590
actually remove that restriction
as the prevalence of infection

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.860
goes down?

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.740
So that's a bit of a
different question, which

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.790
is to limit transmission--

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.670
or maybe another way of
saying that more precisely

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.670
is new cases that are going
to arise in this indoor space.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.420
So now we're not just saying
if an infected person enters,

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.320
we don't want any new cases.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.950
What if we just don't want
new cases at all, including

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.980
taking into account the low
probability that somebody

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.630
actually does enter this
room who is infected?

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.390
So now I'll just remind
you of the results

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.630
from the last board
for that situation

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.050
with all the assumptions
of the previous model.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.570
So the expected number
of I is now pIN.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.690
The expected number
of susceptibles N

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.780
minus the expected
number, which is qIN.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.730
And importantly then, the
expected value of I times S

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.510
is pIqI times N times N
minus 1, which was our result

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.860
from the end of the board.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.640
And so now when we write that
we like the expected number

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.160
to be much less than
epsilon, expected

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.670
total indoor transmissions,
now notice instead of just

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.310
an N minus 1 like
we had before, we

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.190
have these additional
factors pQN.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.390
And so we effectively
divide by that.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.020
So in this case, we can
write our safety guideline

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.210
taking into account
the prevalence

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.010
as epsilon divided by pIqIN.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.960
And so this allows
us as pI goes to 0

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.190
and qI goes to 1,
so in other words,

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.120
as the infection
becomes less prevalent,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.670
then we can start
modifying our guideline

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.310
to increase this bound and,
for example, a lot more

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.779
people to enter the room or to
increase their time in the room

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.420
or to maybe turn down the
ventilation a little bit.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.130
And we can make
changes like that.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.520
It's typically considered
to be a high prevalence

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.360
infection when we're
getting, let's say,

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.790
in the range of
maybe 100 to 1,000

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:44.320
infected per 100,000
people in the population.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.240
So that would be
0.1 to 1.0 percent.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.400
This is really considered
usually quite high prevalence,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.900
actually.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.440
So there's quite a few
infected people around.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.680
But in that case, if--

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.450
let's just say we
had a situation

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.100
with 10 people in the room
just to give an example then.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.000
What would this tell us in
terms of increasing our time

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.420
in the room or our occupancy?

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.670
Well, occupancy is here fixed.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.010
But let's say time in
the room or ventilation

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.780
or other factors.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.330
We can basically
increase our N minus 1

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.230
tau, our cumulative
exposure time,

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.680
which is basically this
indoor reported number

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.820
that we're bounding.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:36.710
This bound will increase or
increases by 10 to 100 times

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.480
because it's basically-- yeah.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.370
This is an extra factor there.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.040
So that means that if
the thing was telling us

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.070
that we could be in the room
for five hours, maybe now

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.100
it'll be 50 hours or even
500 hours actually depending

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.860
on how low the
prevalence actually gets.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.990
And of course, as the
prevalence goes down further,

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.440
and the epidemic disappears,
we start to completely relax

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.490
our assumptions.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.440
And we'll talk
about that shortly.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.080
There's a third
risk scenario that

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.500
is also of interest, which
is to limit my personal risk

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.760
for a given individual.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.520
So in this case,
we have a situation

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.350
where I only care
about myself, one

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.130
particular person in the room.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.710
So the number of susceptibles
is now fixed at 1.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.800
And the number infected
people is potentially

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.890
anyone else in the room.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.610
So I'm worried about
attending event or being

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.650
in an office or some
situation where there's

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.640
a certain number of people.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.140
And the number of infected
that I would expect would be--

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.680
expected number infected
would be-- well,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.390
it'd be exactly equal
to pI times N minus 1.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.800
So, basically, any other person
than myself could be infected.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.670
And so that's the
expected number.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.880
And of course, if S is fixed
at 1, then this expected value

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.670
I is also the
expected value of IS.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.230
So my transmission rate
now has this factor.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:14.780
And notice in this case, we get
the same N minus 1 as before.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.450
But there's this
new factor PI here.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.420
So that then tells me I
could express the bound

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.370
as the indoor reported
number is less

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.590
than epsilon divided by pI.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:31.240
So, basically, we
have these factors

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.990
that come in when we talk
about prevalence that take

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.510
our previous bound
that brings in all

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.240
of the physical
quantities related

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.650
to the room, its ventilation,
filtration, viral deactivation,

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.900
time in the room, occupancy.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.980
And we take those bounds.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.350
And we can essentially
rescale them with these values

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.870
depending on how we are
using the guideline.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.420
Now, this is a very
simple model but at least

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.950
gives us a sense of how
to make those decisions.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.850
So, for example,
let's consider a case

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.090
like we did here where
if the prevalence is

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:09.730
in the range of 0.1% to
1.0%, which is actually

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.000
a fairly high
prevalence, then we

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.090
could increase the
bound on N minus 1 tau,

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:29.950
our cumulative exposure time, by
100 to 1,000 times as a factor.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.070
So if the guideline
is telling us

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.890
that you have five
hours in this room,

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.860
it might actually be more
like 500 or even 5,000

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.730
for one particular susceptible
person given the prevalence

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.750
in the population.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.800
So, basically, just
want you to keep in mind

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.730
that when applying
the guideline,

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.720
the basic ideas don't change.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.320
We start with a bound on
this reproductive number that

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.860
brings in all of the physical
quantities and disease

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.790
quantities that we've
been talking about.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.960
But we also may modify
that bound a bit depending

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.380
on our risk scenario.
