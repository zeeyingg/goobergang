JULIAN BEINART:
We're going to deal

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.470
with three major
topics between now

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.270
and the end of the semester.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.870
The first one is today's.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.950
And that is what is the
relationship between the way

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.180
a city is made and its form.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.990
Is there a relationship
between the way a city is made

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.415
and the form that it takes?

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.550
Next week, we will start
with an examination

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.470
of the relationship between
social structure and spatial

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.860
structure.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.960
I'll do case studies for a
number of cities next week,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.380
probably Jerusalem
and Johannesburg.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.920
After that, we will look
at contemporary form models

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.805
selectively until the
end of the semester.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:44.680
What would be nice would be
if you could use the material

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.990
that we've done, which I
suppose is a kind of a history,

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.060
as a reference to
some of the questions

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.400
that we're going to be
asking of current events.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.460
Today I'm going to spend
a bit of time talking

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.590
about the process by which the
World Trade Center in New York

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.729
was replaced by
the Freedom Tower.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.680
I don't know if any of
you know this story--

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.550
in broad terms,
perhaps not in detail.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.330
In one of the pieces
of reading, you

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.320
will find a comment by
Margaret Crawford who

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.590
used to teach urban
design at Harvard when

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.940
the article questions
whether, after Robert Moses,

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.820
there's a process by
which New York is still

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.790
going to produce great things.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.760
She says, "The
story of democracy

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.450
is one of constant improvement.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:07.110
To look for perfect
answers is the wrong way

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.970
of looking at it."

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.830
So if she's correct,
the important thing

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:24.690
is that the result of a struggle
to produce a certain form

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.580
is contingent and,
most importantly,

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.170
to be oriented towards the
conditions of the struggle

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.860
and the education and
learning that takes place even

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.400
if the product isn't perfect.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.410
That argument would mean that
the society is constantly

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.360
in a state of change
and is much more

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.910
likely to be associated with
the model of buildings which

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.660
can change at the same rate
as society wishes to change,

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.220
the Russians being very
intrigued by this relationship.

00:04:08.752 --> 00:04:09.710
Am I being far-fetched?

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.840
Do you imagine that Melnikov's
project for the Pravda building

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.320
which has three rotating
cores has something

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.240
to do with the speed at
which decisions are made

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.230
and communicated to the public?

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.500
It's a bit far-fetched.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.820
We don't perhaps engage
in the relationship

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.630
between social process
and form making

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.470
in as direct a
relationship as that.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.320
But some people looking
at is Skidmore, Owings,

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.740
and Merrill's Freedom
Tower, which, by the way,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:01.710
is 1,776 feet high, 1776
being an important date

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.350
in American history, tries to
connect the imperial quality

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.810
of a building by its height.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.450
The Burj Khalifa
in Dubai is taller.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.500
It's over 2,000.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.010
And I don't think there's
any attempt in that society

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.080
to link its height to a
particular event in Islam.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.295
But we play games.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:45.500
I've listed nine ideas about
the relationship between form

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.900
and social process.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.920
And I'm only going to spend
our time on a few of them.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:03.590
I want to talk about the concept
of relying on a super figure

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.620
and using the case of
Robert Moses in New York.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.220
Anybody read Robert Caro's book?

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.380
OK.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.080
Well, so we use
ignorance as all of us.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.330
In the case of
making decisions, I

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:33.960
will use the example of the
process by which the World

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.750
Trade Center was replaced in
some detail, the various five

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.630
stages of its procedure.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.840
You are free to take
part in this discussion.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:52.200
I'd like to hear your opinion
as to some of the assertions

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.100
I'm going to make.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.200
Briefly, I'm going to deal also
with the concept of educating

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.350
citizens.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:09.000
If you see form and
people as two items,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.510
you can argue that
if you change people,

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.850
you change their
way of understanding

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.310
the form of places.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.610
And the number of
projects that I

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.190
want to look at very
briefly with you,

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.940
which focus on changing
the nature of people,

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.500
rather than to--

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:34.140
you'll again look back
to last Tuesday's class.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:40.680
One of the great concepts of
the young Soviet urbanists

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:47.610
after 1918 was that they
had a new clientele who

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:54.420
could be shaped to live
up to the qualities

00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:00.300
of the Soviet society which
was newly being formed.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.880
One of the problems
of the industrial city

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.390
was the fact that the client
structure was so fossilized.

00:08:09.965 --> 00:08:15.610
There had been a number
of attemps to use urbanism

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.090
to try to educate
people and to change

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:24.500
this quotient,
this relationship.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.480
I'm not going to
spend a lot of time

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.880
on redressing social imbalance.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:37.250
I'll just mention it and give
an example of it from Boston

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.039
and spend less
time on confronting

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:44.440
the system as a way of changing
the society and its form.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:09:05.800
Kevin Lynch argues that the real
issue in the contemporary city,

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.600
and he's really talking
about the American city,

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:17.980
is that they are a host of agent
families, industrial firms,

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:23.440
city agencies, developers,
investors, regulatory

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.080
and subsidizing agencies, and
so on and so on and so on, who

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.980
produce a process which
at best is fragmented,

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.540
plural and bargaining.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:43.280
The public in this case has
a number of ways of acting,

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.600
typically.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.780
First of all, they
are public works.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.350
The public may build
infrastructure and buildings

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.960
at will.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.570
It can do so in an
uncontested manner.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.250
He doesn't have to
deal with the market.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.660
In some societies, as in great--

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.250
well, not in Great Britain.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:14.990
In some societies, or
certainly in Soviet Russia,

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:22.310
all land was belonged to the
state and private ownership

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.780
of land only became a slower--

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:34.442
I think it's now about
50% of total urban land.

00:10:34.442 --> 00:10:41.630
The public can engage
with the private sector

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.390
in many kinds of relationships.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:50.360
These relationships
have modified and been

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.800
exhausted almost in the range.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.850
They range from the
classic Seagram Building

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:05.690
in New York, which traded
off, which the public ceded

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:09.290
floor area ratio
increases in return

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.785
for setting back the building
to provide public space.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:21.390
There are many more current
trade-off off situations.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.680
There are many in Boston.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.210
The one that I'm thinking
of is the new hotel

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.400
on the waterfront--

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.720
I forget its name--

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:42.570
which has a terrace which runs
up against the public garden.

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:48.570
The trade-off is that the
city has allowed the hotel

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:52.320
to use the terrace for
the service of alcohol

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:57.570
and so on, in return of which
the private firm maintains

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.210
the garden.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:03.750
There's a lot of
maintenance switches.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:11.790
If you look after my house
while I'm going on holiday,

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.930
I will pick up your
mail when you come back.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:23.730
This really operates more
extensively on a smaller scale

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:28.965
as do most urban design
decisions in current urbanism.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.160
The third thing that
the public sector can do

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.660
is create the incentives.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:50.450
The building of most of downtown
office building in Boston

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:55.640
was created by
121(d) legislation,

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.670
which gave tax breaks for
the building of new office

00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:59.634
buildings.

00:13:09.798 --> 00:13:13.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.990
JULIAN BEINART: No, no, no.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:21.600
There was no building of a
new office building in Boston

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.840
during the '50s and
'60s, and this comes

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.500
late John Hancock building.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.410
The first John Hancock
building probably

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.650
dates from about 1960 or so.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.230
They are older
buildings, but the spate

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:41.370
of new office development
was promoted largely

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:46.080
by this public sector
deciding that one of the ways

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.880
to incentivize private
market activity

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.400
was to use the tax system.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.500
The public sector
has enormous power

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.270
in playing around
with the tax system,

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.365
because it's a negative
system of cost.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.880
You lose what--

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.210
I don't want to go into
the economic detail.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.220
It's complicated.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:20.060
And there are a lot of theories
about whether it's good or bad.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.100
But this is just
an example of where

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.090
it was used to build a
skyline for a city which

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:30.430
had no particular attraction
to office development.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.960
At times, the city--

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.850
and I'm using
Boston, because there

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:50.060
are a lot of local examples,
rather than San Francisco,

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:55.390
which is used the trade-off of
public-private relationships

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:58.960
quite remarkably in
rebuilding the waterfront.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:15.710
And there's a building on the
river which houses factories

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:19.010
for making pillows.

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:23.960
It's between-- I don't know
what the bridge is called,

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.990
and the other bridge.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:30.500
It's where you come
off the freeway.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:34.380
It's next to where Harvard's
Business School starts.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.070
You know the building.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.620
It looks like I don't know what.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.060
I mean I can't describe it.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:51.700
You could say that this
could be the argument.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:57.340
The public sector says, we
cannot afford to lose jobs.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:01.720
These properties are within
the municipality of Boston,

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.830
not of Cambridge.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:14.360
It pays us to yield a site to
a corporation, a site which

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:19.660
it prefers because of the
publicity that it gets,

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.440
in order to stop it from
leaving Boston and going

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:29.170
to another city, where it may
equally prosper or prosper

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:29.920
even more.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.390
So if the policy is
that the river is

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:41.680
a sacrosanct public entity
which provides enormous benefit

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:48.690
to the city, hidden and real,
it should not sacrifice its land

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:53.730
on the river for purposes which
are not closely associated

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.830
with human activity.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:56.760
Not factories.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:02.520
You don't put factories
on a modern river,

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.069
but you put factories
on a modern river

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:08.760
in order to keep those jobs.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.450
This is the kind of complicated
way in which the city is made.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:20.490
I think it's a very silly,
stupid decision of short term.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:26.270
There's no body
authority which maintains

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.210
the rights of the river.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.030
There are grassroot
organizations

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:36.260
which are friends
of the river and try

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:41.070
to protect the river from
pollution, and so on.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:46.160
But the river is not
taken up by the city

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:51.050
and then used as a
sacrosanct commodity, even

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.840
economic commodity.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:59.420
It's willing to trade off all
kinds of short-term benefits,

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.280
keeping Biotene--

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.870
I don't know if it's Biotene.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:09.460
I don't know what the company
is, the drug company that--

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:14.950
anyway, let's move on.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:21.160
The public has two other
propositions in its power.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.775
It can regulate activity.

00:18:23.775 --> 00:18:26.860
It can write bylaws.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:33.580
Those are both for protection
and for the possibility

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:39.270
of incremental change.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:48.270
For instance, it could
tax land, which was--

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.540
at the moment, parking
lots in the downtown

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:59.160
are used as investment
centers, waiting for the market

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.600
to reach a point where you could
capitalize on the land fully.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.960
In Johannesburg,
you tax the value

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:15.840
of land at a higher rate
than only land itself.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.360
You assume the
potential of building

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.810
as a function of the
cost of the land,

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:26.050
or the value of the land,
not the cost of the land.

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.500
And so the public
here intervenes

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:35.710
by making sure that land
doesn't lie fallow for too long.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:41.700
So the public can speed up
development or slow it down.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.390
Kevin Lynch, in
the Place Utopia,

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:52.210
talks about different
speeds of development.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.510
This would be one of the tools.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:20:01.620
An interesting thesis which
looked at urban agriculture

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.680
in Brooklyn argued
that urban agriculture

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.830
was one of the modalities of
land use which could easily--

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:10.630
which was very flexible.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:15.660
It could either remain
agriculture and produce goods,

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.310
or it could give way to
more dense development

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:24.330
without having to
replace buildings.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:25.410
I want to go on.

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:33.160
The last function that the
public has in this game

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.260
is education and marketing.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:44.350
In Italian towns in
the early Renaissance,

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:51.340
towns produced books which are
called praise books, which set

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.125
out to advertise their town.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.220
There's a nice
little book written

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.700
by an Italian woman
on these books,

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.840
and there's a parallel
literature in Islam

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.860
called the Fada'il books.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.780
I think there are three
Fada'il books about Jerusalem,

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:16.210
which set out systematically
what the attractions are

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.530
of the city.

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:25.000
It's like "I Love New York"
or a version of making

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.820
the public possibility
that the city has

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.290
into a marketing device.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:47.230
So the public has an
enormous number of powers.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:53.980
And I'm assuming the society
is a market society, as I'm

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.940
assuming that most of the
propositions which I'm going

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.240
to be examining
will be propositions

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:12.880
in a democracy in which
power will be distributed

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.180
through systematically,
and people

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.740
will be able to take
part in various processes

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:26.140
to influence the way the
public and the market act.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:30.550
We'll examine this in the
World Trade Center story.

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:36.490
We'll look at what the New York
Times, what role the New York

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:40.870
Times played, what
role CNN played.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.350
But we'll get to
that in a minute.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:55.780
I'm not going to talk about the
planning technology of decision

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:56.480
making.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.680
It's arcane and
complicated and doesn't

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.030
deal with physical form.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:05.950
It idealizes certain
techniques in decision making,

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:07.960
and thank you very much.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.190
It's not of great
interest to me.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.320
What we've come to realize--

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:19.000
and I think Kevin
Lynch put it well--

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.140
we have a city building
process which is complex

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:27.850
and plural, marked by conflict,
cross purposes, bargaining,

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:31.760
and whose outcome, while
often inequitable or wanted,

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.000
seems as uncontrollable
as a glacier.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.740
He argues this
contentious argument,

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.440
a highly-decentralized
decision process

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.660
in which the immediate
uses of a place

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.690
make the decisions
about its form

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:52.550
is an accepted ideal,
both because it reinforces

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.910
the user's sense of
competence, and because it

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:59.240
is more likely to result in
a well-fitted environment.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:06.480
This is probably
true of us from--

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:13.020
this probably true when the
scale of the proposition

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:17.580
is small and
diminishes in utility

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.990
as the proposition gets bigger.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:26.130
Who would you ask
to make a decision,

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:30.360
to influence a decision on
whether Route 495 should

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.035
be widened?

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.065
Do you do a poll?

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.550
You can do a poll.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:50.950
What utility, what would
you base your results on?

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:59.330
There are users who are
not capable of taking part

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:00.330
in the poll.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.450
There are users
who are too young,

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:06.230
and are only going to be of
age once the proposition is

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:09.080
completed.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:14.360
There are handicapped
people, and so on, and so on.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.905
The utility of user
participation in general,

00:25:17.905 --> 00:25:20.720
then, is spatially conditioned.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:30.400
we have one street in
Cambridge which needs repair,

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.010
I think it would be a good
idea to talk to the people who

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:38.050
live on that street and ask them
what needs, what priorities,

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:40.510
what problems do they have?

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.290
Are there too many
dogs on the street?

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:48.670
Are there too many holes which
are not repaired on the street?

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:51.430
It makes an assumption
about the unique knowledge

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:58.450
that people have about their own
situation, which professionals

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:03.350
don't have, only have
to a limited extent.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:09.640
And so buying into this unique
knowledge is an enormous asset.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:17.880
I mentioned that in the New
Towns Committee in London

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.630
did a broadcast in
1946 asking people

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:25.170
what a good size
for a town would be.

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:30.240
That is the sort of nonsense
use of participation.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.060
But active participation
on a small scale

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:39.930
has become almost
professionally mandated

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.850
in the change of
an American city.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.870
Some people would argue that
it frustrates development.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:54.480
I think development has
built itself into a position

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.220
to take account of it.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:02.550
The fees for user participation
in the big-dig project

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.460
equal the fees for urban design.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:14.200
So the shape of the road,
which is largely mandated

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.260
by engineering concerns,
you can't say it

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.080
should be painted red,
or green, or yellow,

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.490
the real crude rules, about
which you will understand,

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:29.980
about maintaining the perceptual
quality of automobiles

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.370
at 50 miles per hour.

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:39.520
But the right to
terminate, to exit

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:44.140
the expressway into
Watertown-- or, no,

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:48.670
it doesn't go into
Watertown-- into Chelsea

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:53.080
requires, probably, a
bargaining arrangement

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:59.230
whereby Chelsea is given a new
library by the federal funds

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:02.110
that come in to
pay for the project

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:05.260
in order to buy the
right for the road

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.840
to connect at that point.

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:14.080
So public participation,
which we'll

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.940
see a number of examples
of in the slides

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:23.830
I will show you,
probably as a summary,

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:28.510
is a fundamental
aspect of democracy.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:31.660
It requires an educated--

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:35.252
not educated, but
transparent-- population.

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:41.290
People are educated
in different ways.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.480
Formal education
doesn't necessarily

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:47.790
mean that you're sensitive
to your own environment.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:57.080
You're probably so
overlaid by questions

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.970
as to how much your
property is worth,

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:01.580
and whether if a
Black person buys

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:06.280
a property on the same
street, your property is

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.920
going to be devalued.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:12.480
These are important questions.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.880
The major model
by which urbanism

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:19.300
is being transacted
and taught has

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:24.130
been that the great
improvements in cities

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:31.000
have come about when great,
powerful figures, super figures

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:31.830
are in control.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:40.290
Robert Moses is a
great American example.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:43.800
In over 40 years,
he built $28 billion

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:48.540
worth of projects,
the largest city

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.085
builder in America's history.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:57.430
I handed out to you
a couple of things.

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:01.730
The first pages are some
notes I made from Ramparts

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:07.250
in March, 1975, when
Robert Caro's book on Moses

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:10.040
was just published.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:16.280
Ramparts was a left-wing,
radical journal,

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:24.710
and it asked these six people,
those names on the left, what

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:28.220
they thought about, what they
thought the problem with Moses

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.650
was.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:36.470
And I tried to list them in my
own handwriting, what I think.

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:42.720
One of the interesting
ones is the last one.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.230
The second-last man,
Temco, says that Moses

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:49.680
didn't understand
architecture, therefore

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.140
he made bad decisions.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:58.640
Berman follows up by
saying, Moses actually

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.580
did understand architecture.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:06.650
Look at Sigfried Giedion's book
Space, Time, and Architecture.

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:13.400
The flyleaf has one of Moses's
elevated highway intersections

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.010
on its cover.

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:22.250
Gideon talks about the
similarities between Baroque

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:27.530
form and highway curvatures.

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:31.160
He talks about the
great Borromini building

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:39.620
in Rome, the two churches,
which is not [ITALIAN],,

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:40.400
the other one.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:47.630
It's near the pantheon.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:50.300
Forgive me, I can't remember.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.485
My memory is gone.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:32:00.200
Gideon makes a claim
that we should,

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.520
you can well understand
Moses's reaction to that claim,

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.980
that he was actually
doing things

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:11.180
which were being appreciated by
one of the great philosophers

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.370
of modern architecture.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:15.980
But these are
tendentious comments.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.795
Let's look at Moses's record.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:30.420
The argument is
that a good city is

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:35.210
a city of grand design,
large public works.

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:38.640
It's important to have a large
figure who can superintend over

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.160
all the bureaucratic
complexities

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.735
and barriers of city form.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:52.250
Moses, the masses are
incapable or unwilling to act.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:54.710
If allowed to intervene,
no single product

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:56.930
could ever be delivered.

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.080
You cannot have the changes
you need in cities without

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.740
conflict, hurting some people.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.400
Moses is quoted as saying
"you can't make an omelet

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.840
without breaking eggs."

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:20.120
But Moses moved over 100,000
people out of their houses

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.690
in East Tremont, in
the East Tremont.

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:28.310
500,000 people were displaced.

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:32.615
This was a neighborhood of
Blacks, Irish, and Jews.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.970
He wished to build the
Cross Bronx Expressway.

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:49.180
He used a private company
to relocate people.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:52.460
The company had four offices
far away from the neighborhood,

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:55.790
and never had regular hours.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:34:01.120
When an available new
apartment was to be looked at,

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:06.680
there were four floors of
people already on the staircase.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.794
Comparable price
was never achieved.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:15.040
Demolition, even when people
didn't wish to move out,

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.300
demolition started, and
subsequent vandalism

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.210
was used to increase
the working, the moving

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:24.929
out, the speed by
which people moved out.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.649
This is the sordid side
of the grand master.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.260
Moses had charisma.

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:57.240
The book starts with him at Yale
as a brilliant student, ideal,

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.150
wanting to dedicate his
life to public service,

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:03.610
to helping the lower classes.

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:04.860
But he was strong.

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.170
He was a very good swimmer.

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.990
But he was a nasty man.

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:16.970
In the book, he doesn't help
his brother who needs help.

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:19.640
All of these things
paint a picture

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:24.830
of a flawed master,
a kind of a Beethoven

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:29.870
who, if you look too carefully,
doesn't ever wash his clothes.

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:45.540
One of the interesting
things about Moses

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:49.300
was not only the
scope of his work.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.650
He built 600 miles of highway.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.620
He built the Verrazzano Bridge.

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:59.220
He built a number of bridges.

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:03.120
He built a number of centers in
Manhattan, the United Nations,

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:08.570
the Colosseum, Lincoln Center,
all the products of his reign.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:21.590
He was, for reasons which
I don't quite understand,

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:26.270
convinced that automobile
transportation was inexorably

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:28.145
the solution to
the American city.

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:40.882
For instance, the Long Island
Expressway cost $500 million,

00:36:40.882 --> 00:36:47.810
or $500 billion. $500
million, I think, $500 million

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.670
at the time.

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:53.030
He could have added 4
feet for mass transit.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:55.910
This would have cost 20% more.

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:57.470
He didn't.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:01.280
Or he could have purchased
land and kept it in escrow

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:05.480
for further transit for
something like $20 million

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.280
more, but he didn't.

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:14.470
How did he achieve this
power in a democracy,

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:16.435
is perhaps one of the
more interesting things.

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:23.175
How do you achieve such power?

00:37:23.175 --> 00:37:24.800
AUDIENCE: How do you
achieve such power

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:31.430
in a city that portrays itself
to be very sophisticated?

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:35.120
JULIAN BEINART: Well, it is
sophisticated in many respects.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.160
There's some of the most
wonderful restaurants

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:48.570
in the world, and great
opera companies, and so on.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:51.620
Now, I think the
interesting thing

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.890
that one learns from
looking at this case

00:37:54.890 --> 00:38:00.350
carefully is that he
used the public authority

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:03.170
system to build power.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:06.530
Moses was never elected
to office in the 40 years.

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.730
At his peak, he wasn't
challenged seriously

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:15.605
by any governor of
the New York State.

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:25.660
New York Times in its
private memorandum

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:36.250
claims that he could not be
criticized in the newspaper

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.110
without special documentation.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:52.630
But he gained his power from
taking over and gaining power

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:57.820
in the public authority,
which possesses

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.220
not only the powers of
a large corporation,

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:03.280
but some of the powers
of a sovereign state.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.290
It has the power
of eminent domain

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:08.830
that permits the seizure
of private property,

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:12.070
and the power to
establish and reinforce

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:14.182
rules and regulations.

00:39:14.182 --> 00:39:17.470
The public authority has two
other vital characteristics.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:19.810
It's controlled by a
board of directors,

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:23.380
which can be as
small as one member,

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.260
and they can issue bonds.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:30.240
Haussmann understood this.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:41.160
Haussmann used his understanding
of physical economics

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.485
in order to transform Paris.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.120
In 1960, he was the sole member
of the Henry Hudson Parkway

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.510
Authority, one of three members
of the Triborough Bridge

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:01.180
and Tunnel Authority,
Commissioner of the New York

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:05.050
City Parks Department, City
Construction Coordinator,

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:07.510
a member of the City
Planning Commission,

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:10.480
Chairman of the Mayor's
Slum Clearance Committee,

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.400
Head of the City Office
of Civil Defense,

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.330
a member of the New
York City Youth Board,

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:20.582
President of Long Island State--

00:40:20.582 --> 00:40:22.540
oh, god, it just goes on--

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:26.350
president of the Jones Beach
State Parkway Authority,

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:28.330
the Long Island
Parkway Authority,

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:30.880
chairman of the New York
State Tunnel Authority.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:36.220
Having power in so
many domains, which

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:40.960
allows you to
reticulate decisions

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:47.980
which individual
entities can't assume.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.860
If I'm on one board, and
I want a highway to move

00:40:50.860 --> 00:41:00.310
through a park, I can use
the connected power system,

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:03.640
or the contiguous power system.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:08.080
He also used, he
also had a great--

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.870
with power comes the
capacity in this country,

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:15.730
and probably anywhere in
the world, to assume wealth.

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:18.610
He got big gifts
from the Rockefellers

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:26.410
for the building of the
United Nations property,

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:27.940
and so on, and so on.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:56.010
The question is, what kind of
city did he leave New York in,

00:41:56.010 --> 00:42:02.130
and would we have been
worse off, had there

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:03.615
been no figure like Moses?

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:09.925
In our field, we should be
able to answer these questions.

00:42:09.925 --> 00:42:12.220
But there's so many variables.

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:16.510
Nobody probably will
ever be able to assume

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:19.690
the power through the
public corporation system

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:23.140
as Moses did.

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:28.780
We have a completely different
set of environmental issues.

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:36.540
We have all kinds of different
public groups, issues of youth,

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:40.740
issues of gender,
issues of race,

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:46.590
all trends in the importance
of a super figure right now.

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:52.500
Look at what Mayor Bloomberg
is spending his time doing.

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:02.260
There's no Federal Highway
construction program.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.700
So he's not building
any highways,

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:06.930
at lease none that I'm--

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:10.620
Manhattan, it's impossible
to move through Manhattan,

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:14.190
because they're
building subway--

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:22.270
renewing the gas system and
building the Second Avenue

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:22.770
Subway.

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:34.220
So when, in the
history of a town,

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:37.300
do you need somebody who
can assume total power?

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:43.665
Who'd be able to
answer this question?

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:50.700
In a democracy, you
do so when the society

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:52.320
is threatened absolutely.

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.590
Remember Foucault's
rules for what happened

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:57.585
when the plague occurred?

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:12.720
One of the problems of the
project of environmentalism

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:20.100
is that the actual symbols
of environmental degradation

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:24.450
are not impacting
people sufficiently,

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:26.385
not in this country,
not in New York.

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:33.080
And in a democracy,
people will tend

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:39.200
to be lazy about a great
deal of things which

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:45.990
they will suspend until some--

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:51.230
Hurricane Sandy hasn't probably
caused much of a change

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:58.780
in maintaining
flood control land,

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:01.840
and probably will
never result in

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.660
major infrastructural changes.

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:09.210
It means that the
only way that you're

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:12.870
going to be able to
get all of this done

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:18.970
is probably through waiting for
an emergency situation, when

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:21.750
the cost of repairing
the conditions

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:26.950
are 5,000 times higher.

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:29.650
It's a bleak prospect.

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:33.940
It's easy enough to criticize
Robert Moses and Jane Jacobs,

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:42.280
as legions of
liberals have done,

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.950
but it's worth speculating
about the state

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:47.980
of our business in a democracy.

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:55.940
What do you think?

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.635
Have you thought about
Robert Moses ever?

00:46:03.475 --> 00:46:05.430
Well, what did you think of him?

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:11.520
You must have some thoughts.

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.965
You must know something
about the man.

00:46:13.965 --> 00:46:16.210
You have the greatest
urban builder

00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:21.565
in this country's history,
not a trivial figure.

00:46:26.062 --> 00:46:29.515
Are we likely to have
people like that again?

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:43.510
AUDIENCE: Even if we put
more mechanisms and checks

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:46.125
and balances, the
reality is that there

00:46:46.125 --> 00:46:48.030
are people have the
capability of achieving

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:51.490
a lot of power and influence
and just drive context.

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.715
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:46:57.715 --> 00:46:59.850
AUDIENCE: And in
fact, oftentimes,

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:03.430
the population in different
places and different cultures

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:10.060
do like that, whether
if it's proper or not.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.560
So there is a part
of the population

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.380
that actually is pleased
with the notion of somebody

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:16.795
taking charge.

00:47:16.795 --> 00:47:17.670
JULIAN BEINART: Sure.

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:19.065
We are all lazy.

00:47:19.065 --> 00:47:19.690
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:22.680
We're all lazy.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.300
JULIAN BEINART:
And to the extent

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:28.200
that I can trade off my
concerns about my health

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:36.480
to my doctor, who, if he's kind,
he behaves like a psychoanalyst

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:40.260
and relieves me of
worry, I will do nothing

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:47.010
about eating my pills at
the right time, because he--

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:49.590
I've found that
going to see a doctor

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:53.610
and saying that I train at
a health club twice a week

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:55.770
immediately makes me feel--

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:57.570
makes them feel good about me.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.845
Anyway, that's a
bit of an aside.

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:09.100
The interesting thing
is not to, I think,

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:16.020
focus on these extremes,
to imagine cities

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:20.940
as building themselves
over a long period of time

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:26.220
and being much more engaged
in the proper process

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:27.885
by which things happen.

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:36.520
You know, Moses's
work is monumental.

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:40.600
So is Napoleon's for the
Champs-Élysées and Haussmann

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:44.365
for the Boulevard
de l'Opéra in Paris.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.460
Over a period of time, another
generation has grown up.

00:48:54.460 --> 00:49:00.480
Monuments, when we deal with
memory in monuments, one of--

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:01.870
I forget his name--

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:04.660
Robert Musil, the
French critic, says

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:06.820
monuments are amongst
the most forgettable

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:08.095
of items we produce.

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:14.850
You drive through France,
and you stop for coffee

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:17.800
in the afternoon
in a small town,

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.100
and you're sitting
in the square,

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:26.340
and you look at the monument
of a man on a bronze horse.

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:29.550
He fought in the
Battle of Algiers

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:32.380
in god alone knows when.

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:35.910
No small child in the town
pays any notion to him

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:37.890
except that there's
a monument there.

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:44.650
So it is often with cities.

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:50.950
We ingest the new very quickly.

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:54.895
We assign it to a
category of the past.

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.640
Certain aspects of the
past can create value

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.955
by being so much of the past.

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:08.200
AUDIENCE: How much
political process is there?

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:14.380
How much are they momentarily
lost in social memory?

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:19.270
And people forget about
the guy whose monument

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:21.940
was dedicated to, but
how much, in the end,

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:26.170
those monuments become fixtures
in the city and remain in time?

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:27.070
JULIAN BEINART: Yes.

00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:31.960
The one in the central square
in this little French city

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:37.660
that I'm talking about
will never again much

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:40.940
leverage in that
town or anywhere.

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:44.885
It's just a gift because
this man was born there,

00:50:44.885 --> 00:50:47.650
and so on, and so on.

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:51.430
Let's delay talking about
memory seriously when

00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:55.730
we, in a few weeks' time,
deal with Maurice Halbwachs'

00:50:55.730 --> 00:51:00.070
book The Collective Memory and
the whole idea of monuments,

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:05.770
and temporary monuments, and
permanence, and temporariness,

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:07.990
and so on.

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:11.530
Let's just talk briefly
about the World Trade Center.

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:18.350
There are a number of actors
which started the game.

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:22.040
There's the
governor, Mr. Pataki,

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:28.940
who controls the lease, the
sea port authority they gave

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:34.820
to Mr. Silverstein, the
developer, whose towers were

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:39.620
destroyed by some
nasty airplanes.

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:43.052
There's the mayor of the city.

00:51:43.052 --> 00:51:46.460
There are the victims' families.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:53.670
See, if we put them
on a diagram together,

00:51:53.670 --> 00:52:02.526
they all wish to interact in
the creation of something which,

00:52:02.526 --> 00:52:09.615
both as utility, as real estate,
but has nourishment for loss.

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:13.950
It's a tough combination.

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:21.980
The mayor and the
governor get together

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:25.670
and form a Lower
Manhattan Development

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:32.780
Corporation which has-- and
it's another public corporation.

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:35.720
It seems to me that in New
York particularly, things

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:41.090
are so divided that public
corporations for almost

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:46.100
every single item
can be created,

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:49.190
and Moses took a lot
of advantage of that.

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:54.890
The first thing
this the LMDC does

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:59.750
is it hires a firm of
planners and architects

00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:11.180
to make six different
models of the site

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:13.820
as what they call placeholders.

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:16.820
This is just to
describe to the world

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:20.390
what you can build on the site.

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:23.810
The response to this
is very negative.

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:26.600
People say, this is
completely classless.

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:27.770
It's unemotional.

00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:29.360
It's got no guts.

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:30.930
It doesn't mean anything.

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:36.600
It's just a banal
disposition of space.

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:41.870
The LMDC, the New York
Times attacks this procedure

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:47.600
and publishes, you can see
in the piece I gave you,

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:52.190
a little extract from its
publication, "Don't Rebuild,

00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.910
Reimagine."

00:53:55.950 --> 00:54:00.750
It proposes a new high
road on the West side which

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:03.540
links down to Battery Park.

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:06.690
It gets Zaha Hadid
and Peter Eisenman

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:11.640
to design funny-shaped
housing on the road.

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:16.755
It has Rafael Vinoly doing
the new subway station.

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:29.430
The LMDC have got
to do something,

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:36.270
so they decide to do something
called an innovative design

00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:37.030
study.

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:39.780
This is not a
design competition.

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:43.320
They're going to pay
selected architects

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:49.030
flat fee of $40,000 each.

00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:53.870
The seven teams that take
place each paid about $500,000

00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:56.240
out of their own pockets,
just to take part.

00:54:59.590 --> 00:55:02.290
There were very few
limitations or rules

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:04.360
set up for the computation.

00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:09.960
On December the 18th,
2002, the seven teams

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.930
were asked to make a public
presentation broadcast live

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:16.860
on television, as well as set
up an exhibition at the World

00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:20.640
Financial Center Winter Garden.

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:27.060
The exhibit was up for a month
and drew 100,000 spectators.

00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:31.500
CNN, the New York Post did polls
showing a strong preference

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:36.465
for Lord Foster, Libeskind,
and the Think Team's projects.

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:42.270
So much for public
participation.

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:48.090
I haven't got time to go
into the three projects.

00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:53.460
Foster proposed two enormously
tall towers linked together.

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:58.830
They were called the Kissing
Towers project, really quite

00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:06.210
a silly project, because when
you build so much square feet,

00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:10.835
you need to build separately.

00:56:10.835 --> 00:56:16.140
If you build two towers with
this massive square footage,

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:19.710
the chances of you selling
enough square footage

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:22.980
at a fast enough rate to
fill the whole building

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:27.810
would be very difficult.
So buildings are generally

00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:34.125
targeted in size, and
this is 776 feet high.

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:50.980
Anyway, the Think Team's group
proposed a megastructure.

00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:54.550
Their scheme was called
not the kissing towers,

00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:59.050
but the cultural center.

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:03.530
It would be the tallest building
in the world, of course.

00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:05.740
There would be a
great hall 30 stories

00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:13.540
above the ground level covering
13 acres of open space.

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:20.780
A stainless steel system would
hold these towers up in place.

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:23.200
There was a certain
transparency.

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.930
They claimed that
the scheme resembled

00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:30.790
the Eiffel Tower, which is
very difficult to understand.

00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:36.190
Then there was Daniel Libeskind,
a Polish born Jew whose parents

00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:39.770
died in the Holocaust.

00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:42.320
He made his presentation
at the Winter Garden

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:45.200
by relating his vision
of the Statue of Liberty

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.850
when he immigrated to New York.

00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:56.150
Norman Foster used a video of
a little girl in a red dress

00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:59.630
as an important part
of his presentation.

00:57:59.630 --> 00:58:01.530
All of this has
been written about.

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:03.980
There are books
about this story,

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:10.670
all about the kind of
commodification of the six

00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:13.880
weeks after the Winter Garden.

00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:19.730
Two were chosen,
Libeskind and Think.

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:24.650
The final committee
preferred the Think scheme.

00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:26.900
The New York Times
preferred the Think scheme.

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:34.930
And Rafael Vinoly,
the head of the team,

00:58:34.930 --> 00:58:37.780
went to bed on
the Thursday night

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:41.470
assuming that him
project had won.

00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:43.990
He got a phone call at
breakfast the next morning

00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:48.970
to say that the governor had
preferred Libeskind's scheme,

00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:52.060
and the governor had greater
power than the mayor,

00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:53.695
and so Libeskind was chosen.

00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:01.900
Before the catastrophe,
Silverstein, the real estate

00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:08.640
developer, had already
hired SOM to build

00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:11.340
a new building for him.

00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:16.035
SOM coyly didn't take
part in the competition.

00:59:16.035 --> 00:59:22.350
He emerged politically
as the great force,

00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:27.330
David Childs of the
SOM produced what

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:29.610
he called the Freedom Tower.

00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:36.010
They asked that Libeskind was
given 49% of the commission,

00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:37.680
they pushed him out.

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:45.150
And we now have the 1,776-foot
high Freedom Tower as a result

00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:47.500
of this complex
interrelationship between

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:48.000
the media.

00:59:51.240 --> 01:00:00.040
The mourning relatives
got the result

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:04.000
of a competition of
a memorial space.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.190
Calatrava was chosen to
do the train station,

01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:12.490
and that's where it
stands at the moment.

01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:16.930
What's it going to
matter in 25 years time?

01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:18.230
Nobody will know this story.

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:23.540
We are only
rehearsing this story

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:27.320
to put you in a
position of being

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:33.740
critical of ways in which
it could be done better.

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:36.800
This is a completely
bungled, amateurish kind

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:42.480
of claptrap
operation, the problem

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:50.596
of choosing major monuments.

01:00:50.596 --> 01:00:55.640
The Eiffel Tower occurred
through the genius

01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:02.350
of an undistinguished
French structural engineer.

01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:08.740
The Ferris wheel came from
an undistinguished betting

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.720
computation.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:15.190
No, the Eiffel Tower wasn't
a competition, sorry.

01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:18.670
The Ferris wheel for Chicago.

01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:20.980
The Statue of Liberty
was a donation

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:24.910
by the French government
to America, not even

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:28.330
an American product.

01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:32.050
And every baseball game
starts with the singing

01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:35.320
of the National Anthem,
god alone knows why.

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:42.550
And the foreign-born
Statue of Liberty

01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:46.870
is still the single evidence
of American democracy

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:48.010
in physical form.

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:56.870
Where does it
leave us theorists?

01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:59.930
You work on the
stochastic opportunity

01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:05.360
that competitions have,
that a young Asian immigrant

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.400
to the United
States will come up

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:15.010
with a brilliant solution to
the Vietnam War competition,

01:02:15.010 --> 01:02:18.460
putting the names of all the
people who died on the facade

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:22.390
so that generations of children
will be able to recognize

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:28.000
their family name against
the simple embodiment

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.155
of a single monument.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:38.770
Maybe that's what the
human species is all about,

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:39.700
all we can do.

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:50.120
I don't know.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:55.580
I'm not empowered by the
story that I've just told you.

01:02:55.580 --> 01:03:00.620
It seems to me to
have all kinds of--

01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:03.230
I don't know if Robert
Moses would have done

01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:04.640
better, had he been in power.

01:03:11.090 --> 01:03:14.060
After all, perhaps the form
doesn't matter that much.

01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:20.140
I keep on remembering
what Khrushchev said,

01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:24.630
looking back on Stalin's attempt
to build the Lomonosov well,

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:29.160
not attempt-- he's building the
Lomonosov University decorated

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.270
to hell and looking
like a large cathedral

01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:41.280
set of buildings, and so on,
filled with decorative systems.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.930
Khrushchev said, if we'd
have built simple buildings,

01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:49.230
we could have employed, we
could have housed 300,000 more

01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:51.120
students.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.420
Let's forget about all of
this monumental nonsense.

01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:04.470
I'm asking questions which
are very difficult to answer.

01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:05.940
I'm sorry.

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:07.960
That's not what I'm here for.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.840
I'm supposed to
tell you what to do.

01:04:12.450 --> 01:04:15.210
All I can point out is
that society doesn't

01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:17.190
know what it wants to do.

01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:23.490
And maybe in a democracy,
that's all that matters,

01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:26.460
that you're always
alive to opportunities,

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:28.600
and you do the best you can.

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:32.070
And if you believe
in perfection,

01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:34.230
stop being a member of society.

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:35.220
Become a hermit.

01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:46.870
But the failures of democracy
are only tolerable if they

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:55.720
are temporary, I suppose.

01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:01.425
The arguments about gun control
in this country are insane.

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.660
The evidence is
violently against it.

01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:11.430
90% of the population wants
some background checks on guns.

01:05:21.013 --> 01:05:25.200
At the same time, we're
going to probably move

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.600
towards national
legislation in favor

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:32.520
of same-sex marriages, which
25 years ago in this democracy

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.660
would have sounded insane.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:46.290
So I'm arguing that there
may be some relief for us

01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:48.960
in assuming that we
are only elements

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.120
in the democratic system.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.780
And provided we maintain
the democratic system,

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:58.620
we can use our
imagination as best

01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:03.660
we can to fulfill our
obligations of giving form

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:04.995
to societal needs.

01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:12.460
I'm just going to mention
very briefly, because we've

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:20.650
got to look at
pictures, another way

01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:23.620
of dealing in a
Democratic society

01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:28.720
is redressing social imbalances.

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.700
That's what's
commonly known as--

01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:41.823
what's the term now?

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:52.110
Anyway, it argues that
in a democratic society,

01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:56.880
groups have equal access,
don't have equal access

01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:00.230
to support systems.

01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:07.980
So the case where this form
of planning really originally

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:12.540
starts in [? Lupo's ?]
book, very good book,

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:14.670
the story is very
well-explained.

01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:42.030
The highway system
495, 128, a proposition

01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:44.430
exists for building
an inner-belt highway

01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:51.370
through Cambridge
to make linkages

01:07:51.370 --> 01:07:56.860
of all kinds towards
the main roads,

01:07:56.860 --> 01:08:03.210
expressways towards the west
and the south, and the north,

01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:03.750
of course.

01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:15.180
The question of where this inner
belt should run is at issue.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:21.950
One of the candidates is the
rail line just running next

01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:24.590
to MIT.

01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:28.130
MIT objects.

01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:33.830
It makes a foolish decision
to hire an Irish lawyer,

01:08:33.830 --> 01:08:40.399
who in court, in the hearing
says that MIT cannot stand

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:45.830
having automobiles so close,
because it's got its sensitive

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:49.490
laboratories, the magnet
laboratory which is helping

01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:53.840
our troops in Vietnam, when MIT
has claimed that it has nothing

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.850
to do with the
Vietnam War at all.

01:08:56.850 --> 01:09:02.060
So MIT is embarrassed
publicly and loses.

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:09.520
One of our colleagues here,
Bob Goodman, on the faculty,

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:14.380
goes out and forms
a group, takes

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:18.410
a bunch of professionals with
him, and they form a group--

01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:22.300
advocacy planning is the
term I was looking for--

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.430
advocating the
rights of the people

01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:29.210
in Cambridge Port who don't
want the highway at all.

01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:33.609
Finally, they win, and
there's no highway built,

01:09:33.609 --> 01:09:37.640
and Cambridge is a
different city altogether

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:41.300
than what would have
been with a tunnel--

01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:45.250
not a tunnel--
cutting the Earth,

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:51.490
running through either
next to MIT or--

01:09:51.490 --> 01:09:55.720
so what has taken place?

01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:00.520
A professional has given support
to a group who don't normally

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:08.530
have professional support in a
situation of public contention.

01:10:08.530 --> 01:10:13.230
The other group deals with
the education of people.

01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:15.700
There's a whole
variety of types.

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:25.200
There's political education, the
project of Giancarlo de Carlo

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:30.447
for steelworkers in Terni in
Southern-- not Southern Italy,

01:10:30.447 --> 01:10:31.030
Middle Italy--

01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:40.800
where he's asked to
design workers' housing.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:44.640
He has these public
meetings and designs

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.860
certain types of housing.

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:50.790
When the people
complain that he's

01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:55.680
giving them too much space,
he says, you're stupid.

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:58.480
You should argue for more space.

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.780
If you're wealthy,
all of you don't

01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:04.500
have to get up at the same
time to use the bathroom.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:10.770
You need two bathrooms
per family if you're poor.

01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:15.180
He goes on and on, and
the people take this up.

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:19.320
He designs this situation
and gets away with it.

01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:28.490
There's information giving,
telling people about the city.

01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:31.250
A good city is one in which
people are well-informed.

01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:38.840
Patrick Geddes' Outlook Tower,
the IBA in Berlin, Media City,

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:43.040
city of benign consumerism,
Signs and Lights project,

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:47.370
Yellow Pages, opening
up the city's resources.

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:52.700
The visible city is the idea
the city is a schoolroom.

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:55.130
Let's look at some of these.

01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:57.650
This is a project in Terni.

01:11:57.650 --> 01:12:01.760
I'm just going to run
through these early ones.

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:10.500
The project in Terni, the
housing which was built.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:16.620
You can argue against the use
of concrete in this form, fixed,

01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:20.910
when an environment of
greater flexibility.

01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:24.120
These are some other
examples of small town.

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:29.250
This is in York, Pennsylvania,
the redevelopment of,

01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:33.060
the renewal of a
rundown town square,

01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:39.030
people being shown drawings and
asked to learn about the place

01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:40.620
and give their opinion next.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:57.330
Bologna, Red Bologna,
suburban housing

01:12:57.330 --> 01:13:02.440
and the redevelopment of parts
of the center of the city.

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:02.940
Next.

01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:11.070
The redevelopment
proposals forced by people

01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:14.670
argue for maintaining the
facade, existing facade

01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:18.150
of the buildings, the
housing, but putting it

01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:22.140
into a new typology of
larger space behind.

01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:28.230
So you get this idea of
almost the exact counterpart

01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:35.430
of this original street,
but in depth increased.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:38.580
Next.

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:52.390
Pittsburgh, an attempt to build
a model of the neighborhood

01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:57.220
that's going to be
renewed in an attempt

01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:00.340
to actually have
people participate

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:02.900
spatially and
physically in the space.

01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:03.400
Next.

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:17.740
This is an Italian hill
town in the Abruzzo.

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:23.470
This is an architect, Belgian
architect by the name of Kroll,

01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:28.480
building for Leuven University,
in which he imitates

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:36.130
the individual anarchy of
each builder of the house

01:14:36.130 --> 01:14:40.540
in the left in an
attempt to choose

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:43.850
a system of formal
randomness to give

01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:48.010
his facade a particular quality.

01:14:48.010 --> 01:14:51.490
This is a student dormitory
like any student dormitory

01:14:51.490 --> 01:14:52.630
in the world.

01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:57.610
That's a town that's built
up by a process of adjustment

01:14:57.610 --> 01:14:59.180
and change over time.

01:14:59.180 --> 01:14:59.680
Next.

01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:05.040
Robert Moses and
three presidents.

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:14.980
Major figures are always large,
and they're always photographed

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:16.270
to make them seem larger.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.830
I wonder who's a small dictator.

01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:24.330
Next.

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:35.790
These are from Caro's book.

01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:39.780
This is a proposition showing a
dotted line for the Long Island

01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:41.060
Expressway.

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:44.610
And the actual
route that's chosen

01:15:44.610 --> 01:15:51.900
is contoured by it missing all
of the property, almost all

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:56.235
of the property in large
holdings by wealthy people.

01:16:00.245 --> 01:16:00.745
Next.

01:16:04.710 --> 01:16:06.810
I haven't got time
to go into detail.

01:16:06.810 --> 01:16:12.510
That's Moses's proposal
to build a bridge,

01:16:12.510 --> 01:16:18.870
and his depiction of the bridge
in public in the upper two

01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:24.570
diagrams, where the
lower diagram, in fact,

01:16:24.570 --> 01:16:27.760
shows its impact on the
city more dramatically.

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:28.260
Next.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:33.080
This is an MIT--

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.210
we're talking about
education now--

01:16:35.210 --> 01:16:39.230
this isn't an MIT project
called Signs and Lights which

01:16:39.230 --> 01:16:42.380
says one of the
things we can do is

01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:47.450
create much more intelligence
in the built formal environment.

01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:54.770
The project on the right argues
for the coloring of the road

01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:58.460
surface to provide,
to indicate that you

01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:01.110
can travel at different speeds.

01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.610
Next.

01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:11.690
A project in Genoa, in Italy,
in which a neighborhood is

01:17:11.690 --> 01:17:16.520
cleared, and only the fossils,
the essential elements

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.890
of the neighborhood
are maintained,

01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:21.500
giving the people an
understanding of what

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.270
they've got to work with.

01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:26.000
On the basis of
their understanding,

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.440
they precipitate
reactions, create changes,

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.600
produce changes, which
are on the right.

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:35.660
Next.

01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:45.820
Cedric Price's work in England,
the idea of building places

01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:47.990
where people can--

01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:50.800
this is prior to social media.

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:54.250
This is actually making
places in the city--

01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:57.430
the one on the right is
called the Fun Palace,

01:17:57.430 --> 01:18:02.410
and the one on the left is
called the Interaction Center--

01:18:02.410 --> 01:18:05.500
where people randomly
could meet each other

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:11.080
and partake of joyous activity.

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.360
Next.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:19.990
This is a Bedford Stuyvesant New
York project, a Ford Foundation

01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:25.510
study, which is interesting.

01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:28.570
The project is to insert
a new community college

01:18:28.570 --> 01:18:35.860
in a very poor area, and
instead of building a new campus

01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:42.790
with glass buildings,
the form of the building,

01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:47.080
the inserted buildings, are
within the existing framework

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:47.620
of the town.

01:18:54.572 --> 01:18:57.970
All the facilities that are
built for the community college

01:18:57.970 --> 01:19:00.860
are shared by the community.

01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:05.170
In fact, the curriculum
for the community college

01:19:05.170 --> 01:19:09.550
is set by the needs
of the community.

01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:12.340
The sports facilities up
on the top on the left

01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:15.910
are all partly
for the community,

01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:17.630
partly for the students.

01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:18.130
Next.

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:25.930
The park in Philadelphia
on the left.

01:19:25.930 --> 01:19:31.180
The city, the school
without walls.

01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:36.220
The city has got enough
input, education input in it

01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:40.400
to serve as a school.

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:40.900
Next.

01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:48.060
Metro Education
Project in Montreal,

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:53.330
which argues that you
can stop building schools

01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:57.860
and utilize meetings and
connections with people

01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:59.025
in the city itself.

01:19:59.025 --> 01:20:01.700
For instance, up
there is a meeting

01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:06.320
with a professor who
is a big businessman.

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:11.790
And so the subway
system becomes a method

01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:19.370
of utilizing all of the
available space which

01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:23.625
can serve dual mode uses.

01:20:23.625 --> 01:20:24.125
Next.

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.560
Oh, well, you can leave MIT.

01:20:33.130 --> 01:20:35.350
The extraordinary
thing is that this

01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:39.445
was 20 years ago, probably.

01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:49.450
I'm trying to read what
it says at the top.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:58.860
To leave the white walls gray or
paint them white is vandalism.

01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:01.440
Your environment is changing.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.960
Get yourself, get
together with it.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.750
No one knows better how
to create your environment

01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:08.050
than you do.

01:21:08.050 --> 01:21:11.620
Does your environment
respond to your needs?

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:17.290
What a statement of
anarchy invitation.

01:21:17.290 --> 01:21:21.820
This is one of the posters which
I photographed at the time.

01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:22.320
Next.

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:31.240
"Up against the Wall Street
Journal," an urban imperialist.

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:34.900
This is a time when
the form of the city

01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:38.890
was politically significant
to the students in the two

01:21:38.890 --> 01:21:39.635
universities.

01:21:39.635 --> 01:21:40.135
Next.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:48.335
Herrey was MIT's
real estate boss.

01:21:52.570 --> 01:21:53.070
Next.

01:21:55.902 --> 01:22:00.310
The university's response,
the University and the City,

01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:02.540
Harvard's University
and the City.

01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:06.620
These are all University reports
saying how great things are.

01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:07.120
Next.

01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:15.210
There's a thesis done
by Monika Unger called

01:22:15.210 --> 01:22:22.280
"The Politics of Urbanity" on
the history of the attempts

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:26.390
in Brussels, after
the Manhattan plan,

01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:31.380
to respond vigorously
to the plan.

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:39.440
The plan was to internationalize
Brussels, with tall buildings,

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:42.740
as the center of
the European market.

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:47.840
And here are posters
emanating from the society

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:55.340
itself saying no to Carrere, no
to Venturi, no to Chernikhov,

01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:58.335
no to Kroll.

01:22:58.335 --> 01:22:58.835
Next.

01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:07.420
Posters which set out the way
in which local neighborhoods

01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:10.120
should be fixed.

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:16.630
A whole set of items like
this monthly magazine

01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:18.640
for the urban
struggles, information

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:21.280
about the development
projects at Brussels,

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.740
the work of
inhabitants' committees,

01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:26.470
theaters, schools
of architecture,

01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:31.840
cinema, arts museums,
all being formed together

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:37.120
to form a protest environment
with educational material

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:40.430
in the form of daily
posters on the left.

01:23:40.430 --> 01:23:40.930
Next.

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:47.620
So all of this
stuff is an attempt

01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:50.500
to influence the
form of the city,

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:54.540
often stopping negative
things from happening.
