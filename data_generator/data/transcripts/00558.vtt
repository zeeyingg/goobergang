00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.640
JULIAN BEINART: Let me
go through the second set

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.790
of papers with you, which
deal with today's class.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:54.580
On the first page, is a
diagram, two diagrams of Paris.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:06.830
If London-- what are the
major features of London

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.585
that we discussed on Tuesday?

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.855
The rights of citizens to
control their own land.

00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:23.600
Because they [INAUDIBLE]
through the reign of Charles II.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.840
Secondly, the decision
to make transportation,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.350
public transportation,
a fundamental aspect

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.950
of the organization of
the city leading to,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.930
amongst others,
to lower density.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.950
Thirdly, the presence
of the aristocracy

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.910
in the center of the
city, subdividing to take

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.035
care of a rising
middle-income middle class.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.525
The rest are details.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.690
The fire and the
plague, just disasters

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.920
which brought about
certain fundamental changes

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:24.120
such as the imposition
of the new sewage system.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.540
Paris is a very different city.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.920
You've all been to Paris, so
you know what I'm talking about,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.580
I hope.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.760
For reasons which are not clear
to me, in the 18th century

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.540
already, in 1750,
there was a competition

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.980
held by Louis XV, who was
already safely ensconced

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.595
in Versailles, 18 miles
from the center of Paris.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.940
This is not a place to eat.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.110
I'm sorry, Michaela.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.430
It's difficult to have
classes at lunchtime, but--

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.130
STUDENT: Sorry.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.380
JULIAN BEINART: It's OK.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.692
Is it cold or hot?

00:03:15.692 --> 00:03:16.403
STUDENT: Cold.

00:03:16.403 --> 00:03:17.820
JULIAN BEINART:
Oh, so it'll last.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:29.310
There was a competition to make
the center of Paris resemble

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.710
Versailles.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.880
It was won by a man
called Patte, P-A-T-T-E.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.570
And I will show the plan.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.560
The elements of
the plan establish

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.010
a number of fundamentals.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.830
First of all, there are walls.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.140
Look at the number of walls
that encompass the city

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.790
from over the 900 years--

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.400
well, even more than the
900 years as a kingdom.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.570
The first wall, in 1250--

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.950
the first wall in AD 250.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.340
That was a Roman wall.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.274
The Romans left,
more or less, 500 AD.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.550
The subsequent walls are
the 12th century wall,

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.820
the 14th century wall,
the 17th century wall,

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.790
the 18th century wall, the 19th
century wall, the Périphérique.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.360
You'll notice that
whenever an enclosing wall

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.490
hits a main axis--

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.380
in this case, the
Champs-Élysées--

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.020
there's an important place.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.130
The Étoile, the Porte Maillot,
the Place de la Concorde.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.720
Paris has-- was built out of
three fundamentals, streets,

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.625
walls, and--

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.980
there were three.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.480
One is escaping for the moment.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.370
Let's just continue
through this.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:38.970
The next page is the final
step in the transformation

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:46.600
of the center of Paris
by the work of Haussmann,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.570
from about 1850 to 1872.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:06:01.190
1872 marks the end of
the kingdoms of Paris,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.580
which started with in 987 AD.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.020
And the third of the components
that I was going to mention

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.020
were monuments.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.380
Prime example of
a monument which

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:25.860
persists from the beginning
in the 12th century, added to

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:35.250
and transformed over time by
kings and their queens giving

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:41.370
it its final shape through the
work of Louis Napoleon III.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.320
And then, finally, the Arc
du Carrousel, the center

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.840
point being the work of
an American architect.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:07:00.450
The diagram below is
from work and writing

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.100
by Guy Debord, which argues--

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:10.620
Guy Debord and Asger
Jorn and Victor Constant,

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:15.930
all participants in the movement
called the Situationists.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:21.730
Situationists believed
in something they

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.070
called psychogeography.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.690
That was the system in which
the experience of cities which

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:33.100
was not delimitated
by simple boundaries.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:39.070
This diagram indicates that
the experience of Paris

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:45.220
is much to be made, not through
the compartments designed,

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.410
administrative
components designed

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:52.690
by Haussmann, but as a
free system of movement,

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:57.640
much like a taxi ride
moves through a city,

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.880
independent of boundaries.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.450
There is a film
which they referred

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.060
to which I can't remember.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.760
It's a film of a
French prostitute

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.320
who works freely in the city.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.880
I tried.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.310
I can't remember.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:24.370
The next page indicates
another use of the streets.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:31.670
1848-- the two revolutions
of 1848 and 1871,

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:36.710
the idea of the street as
a system of barricades.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.174
The next page is a section
through the boulevard house.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:57.310
This is a typical section in a
Haussmann elevation, one, two,

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:03.940
three, four, five, floors, the
fifth floor being the roof.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.280
There's a pharmacy
on the ground floor,

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.070
some commercial activity.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.380
The first and second
and third floors

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.365
are middle-class apartments,
and the top floor

00:09:14.365 --> 00:09:18.430
is where the artists
[INAUDIBLE] La Boheme

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:23.590
and La Traviata and so on
happened in the top floor.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:39.700
This construction is one of the
keys to the density of Paris.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.740
Paris has always been dense.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.770
It's attracted enormous
amount-- it was the greatest

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:49.580
manufacturing city in the
second half of the 19th century

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.230
and attracted immigrants.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.200
Not national, not
extranational immigrants,

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:03.860
but rural immigrants to the
city between the period of 18--

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.150
oh.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.700
We'll get there.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:20.035
OK, I think that's
the last of the pages.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.350
The walls are interesting
for a number of reasons.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.585
They consume capital.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:53.610
The last 19th century wall
created a large space north

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:58.290
of the current Haussmann city.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:02.070
Today, two million people
live in the center of Paris

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:06.210
and six million people live
in the Banlieues, which is

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.390
the suburban sprawl condition.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.180
Which the competition,
Sarkozy's competition of 19--

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.640
what are we?

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.470
Or 2008, which some
example-- and we'll

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.050
go through some examples
from that competition.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.740
So, essentially, the other
interesting aspect of the wall

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.255
was that it paid.

00:11:36.255 --> 00:11:41.580
It brought in a lot of money
to Haussmann's capacity

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:55.060
to engage in loans from banks
to pay for the purchase of land

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.270
in order to divide--

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.952
[INAUDIBLE] his
new road systems.

00:11:59.952 --> 00:12:06.000
The octroi, O-C-T-R-O-I, was
a major source of income.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.240
Wine and food was
taxed at the gate.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.850
This is a device
which is still common.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.750
Robert Moses used the
income because he controlled

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:22.280
the taxation system of
transportation into New York

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.430
through the bridges and tunnels.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.610
In Boston, we have
the same silliness,

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:35.360
that we still pay tolls
to the authority which

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:41.960
runs the Seaport,
badly, and the airport.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.795
It's an old system,
paying at the gate.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:54.760
So we want to look at
900 years of history,

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.320
and I'm just going to pick
out some aspects of it

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.060
because, really, one--
this is an enormous topic.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:08.410
And I want to concentrate on
the spatial environmental issues

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.410
and relate them
back historically.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:16.930
So, for instance, Henry
IV, one of the great kings

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:37.390
of Paris, 1533 to
1610, had a second wife

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.330
called Marie de' Medici.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.970
There were two
Medici women who were

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:49.520
important in these
years in Paris.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.845
She introduced another idea
into the street system.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:12.550
In Florence, streets
were closed so

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.760
that people could play games.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:24.450
The games were called, in
Italian, magliare, to hit,

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.310
la palla, a ball.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.292
Right?

00:14:34.292 --> 00:14:35.180
STUDENT: Magliare?

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.770
JULIAN BEINART: Magliare.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:40.846
Maglio is a hammer, isn't it?

00:14:40.846 --> 00:14:41.429
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:14:41.429 --> 00:14:42.375
Never heard, that one.

00:14:42.375 --> 00:14:44.240
But, yeah, maglio is a hammer.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:44.740
Yes.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.365
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah,
magliare la palla

00:14:46.365 --> 00:14:53.590
is the phrase which
is used to describe

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:59.380
the games they played like
croquet, with hitting a ball.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.690
There are versions of
this game, obviously.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:26.110
The area around
Buckingham Palace,

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.470
where Regent Street's going
through Piccadilly Circus,

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.110
runs into the Crown
near [INAUDIBLE] area,

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.380
is called Pall Mall.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:42.025
The place where American
teenagers meet is a mall.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:51.430
Magliare la palla,
Pall Mall, mall.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:16:04.250
The Cours la Reine in Paris
became as Marie de' Medici

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:09.260
built it, who was responsible
for its construction,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:17.960
became a place where French
could meet in their carriages

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:23.960
and have flirtations with other
members of either the same sex

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.450
or the opposite sex.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.200
Essentially, it was a--

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:35.960
it took an idea of a street
as an environment for play

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:43.785
and transformed it into another
version of the same idea.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:51.330
So the streets of Paris
played almost every role

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.130
you can imagine.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:17:00.150
This is, linguistically,
an interesting reach,

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.880
from closing a
street in Florence

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:09.030
to play a game to use the
same word etymologically,

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.980
now being used for--

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.480
to describe an American
shopping center.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.520
Any connection?

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:20.560
I don't know.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.329
Nor I've seen this explained.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:30.960
Perhaps the mall
became a general term,

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:36.210
and the Americans picked it up
and applied it indiscriminantly

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:37.890
of its origin.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:38.910
Absolutely.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:51.830
Well, the Romans crossed the
river, as they did in London,

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:55.580
but found an island
about 20 acres large

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.390
in the center of the river
which became the foundation

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:03.320
of the city of Paris.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:13.030
The Romans stayed until
about the fifth century.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:15.280
One of the governors
of the Romans was--

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.090
had my name.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:19.570
He was a cousin--

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:23.340
he was a nephew of the
Emperor Constantine.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.980
He then became the last
of the Roman emperors.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.430
He was killed by his
own troops because he

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:34.510
was unlike his uncle
or a Christian.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:39.190
He believed in stemming
the Christian epidemic

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:46.300
and wanted Rome to remain in
touch with the Mithrian rights

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:53.440
and multigods and systems
of religion, which was being

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.540
sabotaged by Christianity.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.660
I'm just going to
go through some

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:11.620
of the aspects of this spatial
system is put into place.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:26.390
Philippe August, 1180 to 1223,
built on the Ile de Cité,

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.070
the island.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:33.020
He built a palace, the
beginning of the Louvre,

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:40.720
the law courts, the bishop's
palace, Ile de Cite,

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.330
all on the 20 acres.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:44.695
He built the second wall.

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:53.540
He already agitated for the
rebuilding of Les Halles.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:58.030
Les Halles, the
land of Les Halles

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.510
was developed and
occupied by Jews.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.630
In the 12th century,
it was common to be--

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:10.700
for kings to be anti-Semitic.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.670
The Jews were expelled
from their property,

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.490
and Les Halles was built.
So when you go to Les Halles

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.850
today, which are now an
underground shopping center,

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:25.470
you'll have to think back to
understand that it was land

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.290
from which Jews were expelled.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.170
In England, at the
same time, Jews

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:33.500
had to wear a badge
to show themselves as

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.660
different from ordinary people.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.320
They had to pay tax when
they entered or left London.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.710
And Henry II, I think it was.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:51.110
So the behavior
of the French King

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:56.980
was in sync, synchronized with
the behavior of his colleagues

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.590
out in Europe.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:03.040
Notre Dame was built
in the 12th century.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.990
So centered is Paris in
the geography of France

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:11.950
that, even today, all
measurements in France

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.550
measured from Notre Dame.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.560
There isn't that sense of
centrality in the London.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:30.100
There were crowds gathered
to watch a hanging,

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.800
but nothing like
the crowds which

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.750
gathered to watch the guillotine
and to watch people be headed,

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.000
to wath cats being fried.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:57.660
The great King Henry
IV, a 16th century king

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.880
whose second wife
Marie de' Medici

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.530
I've mentioned already in
relation to Cours la Reine,

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:11.550
he built a large section of the
central part of Paris, bridges,

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:18.330
palaces, churches, gardens.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:20.250
He built the Pont Neuf.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.500
He also built the
Place Royale, which

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.460
is the largest residential
square in Europe

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:33.720
and the predictor of
the Covent Garden model.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:38.670
The Cours la Reine, at
least the Place Royale,

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.940
which is now the
Place des Vosges,

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.110
is 140 meters, if I
remember correctly,

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:48.630
140 meters by 140 meters.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:53.910
It's the largest residential
public space in Europe,

00:22:53.910 --> 00:23:05.340
built as the residence for the
royalty and the aristocracy.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:22.175
A number of attributes of the
street system were reinforced--

00:23:22.175 --> 00:23:23.430
oh, let me just--

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.040
just want the correct quotation.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:45.930
"On April the 10th, 1783,
the first royal declaration

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:49.530
of an urban policy
was promulgated.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:53.220
It was worth noting that it
followed an accurate map."

00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:03.190
Turgot, he made the first
correct map of Paris.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:06.960
It was correct in the sense
that it was more accurate

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:14.610
than the typical perspective
view of cities up to that time.

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:20.910
The Great Map of Rome
by Nolli was 1748.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:27.060
And Turgot did as best he could.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:32.880
The great first
orthographic map of Paris

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:40.200
was the work of a Burgundian
architect called Verniquet.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:50.270
Verniquet took
accurate measurements

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:53.630
during the day in the
crowded Paris streets.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:57.110
His grand observations were
corrected by triangulation

00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:01.520
to determine the
elevations of the city.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.290
In 1783, there's an
interesting connection

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:11.210
between the availability of an
accurate map and the capacity

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.300
to make a pronouncement
of urban policy.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:26.380
The streets are important
for the public welfare.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.950
They ought to be sufficiently
wide and free of any barriers

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:35.920
to the free and easy passage
of vehicles and pedestrians.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.650
They further asserted
that overly tall buildings

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:45.040
were prejudicial to clean air
in a city as populous as Paris

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.600
as well as contrary to public
safety and prone to fire.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:26:01.650
Already, in 1793,
there was not only

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.980
the ability to demarcate
space accurately

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.550
because of an accurate
map, but the capacity

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:11.820
to put into place
regulations which

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.180
decided what the
dimensions of a street

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:20.160
were and also of the
ruling, which has lasted

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.160
in central Paris
ever since, and that

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.980
is not to allow tall buildings.

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:38.970
Whilst the spatial
idea of having

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:46.930
as direct a distance between
two monumental points

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:48.960
was an idea which
had been around

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:53.100
in French landscape
for a long time,

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.530
there was nobody, really,
who could articulate

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:56.715
that idea in practice.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.310
The street system was
not only for play.

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:07.340
It was for rapid movement.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:11.120
Denied by the building
of barricades,

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.690
the street system
was also a sequence

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:21.780
of connectivity between
various aspects of the city.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.860
Already, early on,
the French King

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:28.430
decided that the university
would be on the Left Bank

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:31.620
and commerce would
be on the Right Bank.

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:40.400
But instead of developing
these as the sole elements

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.080
of the space, a system of
avenues which connected

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:50.360
the important points, often
monuments, reticulated and made

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:56.450
a multidimensional space,
in this case, a box

00:27:56.450 --> 00:28:03.690
base of limited height but
a compressed space, now

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:09.860
of two million people, all
articulated by the rulings

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.620
about streets.

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:22.360
Haussmann, who became
prefect in 1851,

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:30.740
was really responsible for
being the first urban manager

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.990
in any city in
relatively recent times.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.540
What he did was
take an idea which

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:43.790
was in the DNA of the French
Parisian system of streets

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.160
and make it possible.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:51.560
Paris was an unruly
medieval city.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:56.000
It was-- you read
Stendhal, he talks

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.630
about the mud in the streets
and the filth in the streets.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:04.040
It was no different from
most cities at that time.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.290
And it also was the
site of cholera.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:17.420
There were great cholera
epidemics in 1839 and in 1842.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:21.810
There were workers
riots regularly

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:25.670
in 1830s, the 1840s,
this following

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:33.080
that Great Revolution of 1789.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:37.320
Haussmann arrived
after the failure

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:42.110
of the last-- second-last
king to maintain his position,

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:45.320
and he was replaced
by Louis Napoleon.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:50.420
Louis Napoleon
had been in exile.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:57.380
And there are stories of
him being in Durgin-Park,

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.560
in the restaurant
in Boston, talking

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.170
about this great new city
that he was going to build

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:06.080
when he went back to Paris.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.560
He had watched Regent
Street in London

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.332
and, with great
admiration for the--

00:30:11.332 --> 00:30:14.870
what built Regent
Street in London.

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:19.790
The compact included
permission by the Parliament,

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:23.270
a million pounds of
money from the bank,

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:32.650
and the right to
purchase property

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.860
in order that the property
may be transformed according

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:36.880
to a street system.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:47.550
Louis Napoleon was
obsessed with this idea

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:50.910
that he could rebuild Paris.

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:55.890
He happens to be the last
king in the history of Paris.

00:30:55.890 --> 00:31:01.800
He made a bad decision to
start a war with the Prussians,

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:13.590
and Paris was bombarded and
the court moved to Versailles

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:18.090
and a republic was
established after the war.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:23.040
So Haussmann's 20
years are 20 years

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:32.010
at the end of 900 years
of royal regime in Paris.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:38.610
You cannot account for a similar
set of circumstances in London

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:42.960
or in Vienna or in Berlin or any
of the great European cities.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:54.760
Haussmann was a maniac
for a number of things.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.150
Spatially, I don't know
about his personal life here.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.090
That's another story altogether.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:06.800
He wanted absolute control.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.520
He says to the Emperor--

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.480
when they have the first meeting
of the town planning commission

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.640
and there are lots of
speeches and everybody's

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.290
sitting around--

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.330
he talks to the Emperor
after the meeting

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:22.420
and says, "What a waste of time.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.630
All these people like big
speeches, and nothing happened.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:26.980
We don't get any work done."

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:29.590
The Emperor says, "Well,
how big does the commission

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.670
have to be?"

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:33.400
He says, "Well, the Emperor,
you would have to be there

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.120
and I have to be there, and I
can't think of anybody else."

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.330
The Emperor says, "Sounds
like a good plan to me."

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:45.820
So the commission becomes one
man, the Prefect of the Seine.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:49.090
Rambuteau, the Prefect
of the Seine before him--

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:52.990
there were a number of others,
Berger and Persigny and so on--

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:59.980
but Rambuteau tried to
extend the East-West access

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:03.835
to the Bastille, as Napoleon
tried to do, but failed.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:13.270
He proposed the street which
has his name, the Rue Rambuteau,

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:16.840
but could only afford
to build it out

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:20.260
of the budget of the city.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:27.700
He could build one mile, and
he was allowed to make it.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:31.180
He only asked for
13 meters width.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.590
He was allowed 20 meters.

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:37.210
But the story of Rambuteau is
the story of the fact that you

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:42.220
cannot do a major reconstruction
of a city out of the capital

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.800
budget of the city.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:49.950
What the greatest
invention of Haussmann,

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:54.270
it was not easy arrangement,
but economists like Saint-Simon

00:33:54.270 --> 00:34:02.640
constructed the idea that if you
improved an asset, its worth,

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.820
no matter how much you
invest in the improvement,

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:09.285
its worth in the end is going
to pay it back many times.

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:15.310
It's called deficit
spending, today.

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:17.620
And Haussmann
understood that in order

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:25.630
to rebuild Paris from being a
medieval slum to a modern city,

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:29.020
you needed to
develop more capital

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:33.159
than the ordinary taxation
system in the city can do.

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:45.730
So he took the money from the
octroi system, borrowed money.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:49.630
He expropriated land.

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:56.219
In 1783-- no.

00:34:56.219 --> 00:35:02.790
Slowly, in the 18th century, the
control of Paris by the kings

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:04.440
diminished.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.080
And when the rule-- after
the Revolution, of course,

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:10.615
there were no kings until Louis
Philippe and Louis Napoleon.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:21.480
The notion that you could move
people out of their domains,

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:26.370
rebuild the premises in
which they lived, and not

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:31.810
care for them through
replacement accommodation

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:35.340
and so on, took hold
under Haussmann.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.730
Haussmann, in 20
years, rebuilt Paris

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:44.430
in ways which were part of
the DNA street system of Paris

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:50.805
and made possible, in modern
times, by deficit spending.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:56.820
The loans which
Haussmann accumulated

00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:03.030
in the 20 years where
only repaid in 1929,

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:09.030
but Paris was an immensely
more valuable city in 1929

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:14.110
than it was in 1850.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:20.520
So we have the introduction into
the urban system of a business

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:25.020
model, of a management model.

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:28.290
Haussmann had his
own predilections.

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:30.930
He did not believe that
individual buildings

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:32.190
were important.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:35.590
He believed that the systems
of building were important.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:39.030
He hated the idiosyncrasy.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.150
All the buildings had
to be the same height.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:46.200
There's an image
in what I gave you.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:52.590
There's a photograph
of a street in Paris

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:59.250
where he forces the
property on the left

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:03.540
to shift its turret
to the street in order

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:06.572
that it balance a building
on the opposite side

00:37:06.572 --> 00:37:07.155
of the street.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:12.780
What else?

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:16.500
This is an enormously
long story,

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.270
but I'm giving you
the bounds of it.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:22.650
If you're interested,
there's good literature

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:25.050
on the history of
Paris and certainly

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:36.590
the period of 1850 to 1870.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:42.330
What else can I say before
we look at some images?

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:45.200
This is about as bare
a description of Paris

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.810
as I can imagine.

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:53.000
But the extraordinary
capacity for the street system

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.640
to be the major articulator
of movement, of war,

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:10.200
of play, of distribution,
of psychogeography,

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.160
Haussmann felt that if
you look down an avenue,

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.640
you had to have a closed vista.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:22.110
You had to be led to something
which was an important place.

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:28.760
In Washington, which has a
kind of Parisian kind of plan,

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:33.620
the intersections of
the diagonal avenues,

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:36.335
where they meet each
other, produce nothing.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:42.550
In Paris, there's always an
important square or monument.

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:51.060
When Haussmann decides that we--
that the city needs an opera,

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:55.920
he builds the Rue de Opera
and then the opera itself.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:00.690
The opera, it has an
extraordinary interior.

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:05.430
Adding to the complexity of the
spatial relationship of access

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:07.020
to the opera--

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:10.530
the facade of the opera is
a monument standing freely

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:11.640
in space--

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:18.090
and then the entrance and
interior, a fantastic interior,

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:21.050
as well.

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:25.340
What you have in this
Haussmannian system

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:32.690
is this state set of
multifunctional connectors

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:36.200
tying decentralized
aspects of it.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.902
There's no center to Paris.

00:39:38.902 --> 00:39:39.860
There are many centers.

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:50.920
You have, as you'll see
in some of the slides,

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.610
passages connecting
with covered roofs

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:57.620
in between the boulevards.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:09.380
You have an articulate and
very elementary system based,

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:14.030
as I say, on of DNA of Paris
since the 15th century.

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:19.550
Why the French
articulated their space

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:24.080
around the idea of minimizing
distance between points

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.370
and being articulate about that
distance and the experience

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:33.050
of that distance is
still, to me, unclear.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:38.820
But it's absolutely different
from the case of London,

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:41.340
where we have one
street, Regent Street,

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:46.290
artifacted in a similar pathway.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:49.080
As Haussmann did it,
the scale of a city.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.670
I need to see if there's
anything else I should say.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:01.360
Any questions?

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.910
STUDENT: If I understood
what you said earlier,

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:09.730
it was that the idea of a street
or a path connecting monuments

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:13.420
is like an older
idea than Haussmann.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.550
If I understood you
correctly, like, where

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:18.280
did that originate from, like
in Paris or in French culture?

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.840
JULIAN BEINART:
Well, I don't know.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.700
As you'll see, in
the second slide I

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:28.330
will show you of an image of
streets in the 15th century--

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:29.360
oh, it's later.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.590
It's probably 17th
century Paris.

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.870
You will see
diagonal road systems

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:38.260
in these rural
areas around Paris

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:41.740
as well as in some
in Paris itself.

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.980
When I talk about
the DNA of a city,

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:48.680
I don't know exactly
what I'm saying.

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.960
It's a biological
explanation, assuming

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:57.700
that there are repetitive
elements, significant elements

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:00.340
in a culture, which repeat.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:03.850
Often, we don't quite know why.

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:06.100
I often think that the
French are probably

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:09.430
more direct than anybody
else philosophically

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:13.210
and probably decided,
like Bismarck did,

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:18.550
that the way to fight a war
is to go in a straight line

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:21.460
because you'll find nobody
else on the straight line.

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:26.200
Everybody else is fussing
around all over the place.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:31.600
It's the direct
avenue to accomplish

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.970
the friction of distance.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:39.810
I can't-- I wish
I could answer it.

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:42.810
I'm sure a French, if we
had a French scholar here

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:47.220
or a French historian,
there may be a--

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:54.060
I've often looked for an
answer, but I haven't found it.

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:58.980
It's interesting to
raise that question

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:02.010
because, now, two
million people are living

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:07.330
in this precious construction,
and six million people are

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:11.950
living in bungalows, in public
housing, because public housing

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:15.790
was not asserted as an
element to be incorporated

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:17.830
into the Haussmannian puzzle.

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:25.280
The city now has
this empty sprawl,

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.890
which everybody dislikes.

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:34.540
And Sarkozy says, I need
to do something about it.

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:43.720
I don't know if you
followed this competition.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:44.730
Did you?

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:46.205
Did you see the results?

00:43:46.205 --> 00:43:48.372
STUDENT: I remember seeing
some of these renderings,

00:43:48.372 --> 00:43:49.316
but I don't know.

00:43:49.316 --> 00:43:50.566
I don't know what's going to--

00:43:50.566 --> 00:43:53.590
JULIAN BEINART:
Oh, it was, I'm--

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:57.680
I don't know if there's a book
of the entrants now available,

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:01.870
but it was subject to a lot
of publicity at the time.

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:04.690
And the images I've
just gathered here

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:08.530
are taken from some of
the publicity at the time.

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:17.930
A number of things that one
wants to say about this.

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:32.760
Everybody acknowledges
that the way to enlarge--

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:36.610
not to enlarge,
to fill the space,

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:39.910
empty space around
the concentrated city,

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:42.020
is not to expand
the city itself.

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:52.020
None of the 10 entries
in the competition which

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:57.840
use streets, avenues,
diagonalized systems

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:00.600
as an extension of
the Haussmannian grid.

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:27.550
There are many attempts to
do strong constructions,

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:30.730
strong constructions
meaning constructions

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:34.620
which have a strong
physical spatial dimension.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:52.270
For instance, Grumbach proposes
that Paris will extend itself

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:55.870
westward along with the Seine
to accommodate something

00:45:55.870 --> 00:46:00.430
like 16 million people,
arguing that every great city

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:02.470
in the world is a
port city and Paris

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:04.000
should become a port city.

00:46:08.356 --> 00:46:11.926
A linear city of 16 miles--

00:46:11.926 --> 00:46:15.875
or 16 million people would take
about an hour by public transit

00:46:15.875 --> 00:46:20.030
or fast train from
Paris to Rouen.

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.735
And it's a strong idea.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:32.180
You can imagine a city
like this, following

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:39.340
this pattern and developing
interesting relationships

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:43.790
between public transportation
along the water

00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:45.380
and many aspects of it.

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:52.620
What will stop it
from developing

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:58.200
the same condition of sprawl
as now exists, I don't know.

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.350
He doesn't detail very
much about anything other

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:05.250
than the concept itself.

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:07.380
There are some
crazy propositions.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:10.890
The one is to take, just
close the Gare du Nord

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:14.760
and shift the Gare do
Nord into the Banlieues

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:18.510
and have it as the premier
railway station in Europe.

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.900
Richard Rogers, the
British architect,

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.120
has a modest proposal.

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.510
He's really interested
in the the politics

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:35.660
of all of the groups
in the Banlieues

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:38.710
and how they could
be brought together.

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:43.480
He extends some of
the radial system,

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.430
but covers them with green--

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:50.430
remember that the
computation was called

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:54.000
for post-Kyoto Resolution.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.770
Post-Kyoto means that the
ecological consequences

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:03.440
of the plan were important.

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:06.660
Jean Nouvel, for instance--

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:17.010
many of the competitors proposed
to cover all the buildings

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:22.530
with sun collectors, energy
collectors from the sun.

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:26.830
Jean Nouvel says,
all of the housing,

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:32.010
public housing built
in the Banlieues

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:34.200
are just bad buildings.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:38.070
They just can't keep
them and convert them

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:44.400
in as interesting and
dramatic and up-to-date

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:47.700
fashion as possible.

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:50.710
He says silly
things like, "Paris

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:55.640
must become the great art
center of the world again."

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:58.650
He proposes something on
the Ile de Cité which I

00:48:58.650 --> 00:48:59.820
can't understand.

00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:09.360
There's almost a sense of
tiredness about the scheme,

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.900
as if there isn't
really a formula

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.735
anymore for making urban space.

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:25.670
Haussmann has really
terminated 900 years

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:32.570
of French royal effort to build
walls, to build monuments.

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:43.400
Imagine having a monument in
the center of a city which

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:49.710
was built by the first king
and then torn down and rebuilt

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:52.080
by the second king and
then rebuilt and rebuilt

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:55.800
and rebuilt and
rebuilt as the Paris--

00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:03.970
as a palace, ending
up with I.M. Pei doing

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:07.960
a kind of central focal
point for it after it

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:11.035
becomes a museum after a
thousand years of palace.

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:15.560
It's the largest
museum in the world,

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:22.460
I think, and certainly
probably the most significant.

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:24.350
Yet it's on the River Seine.

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:26.930
It blocks access to the river.

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:32.390
It's a big block of
something or other.

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:35.630
It's as permanent as
the city, and there's

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:39.236
no moving it as many have.

00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:42.090
And there's, in
a class later on,

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:46.340
we look at temporary
environments in cities.

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:52.100
I will go through the various
French five French exhibitions

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.400
in the center of Paris.

00:50:53.400 --> 00:51:01.070
1855, four years after the
Crystal Palace; 1868; 1879,

00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:04.820
I think; 1889; and 1900.

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:07.115
1889, of course,
the Eiffel Tower.

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:13.580
Jean Giraudoux, the
French playwright,

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:20.810
talks about the center of
Paris as being a stone site,

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:27.440
a permanent, fixed,
[INAUDIBLE] set of operations,

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:30.620
and these temporary
exhibitions are the sort

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:32.850
of way of animating them.

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:36.570
It's like a circus coming
to small town once a year.

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:41.200
It's an extraordinary
idea, that a city

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:45.730
could be fossilized in
some sort of way, gaining

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:48.190
in prestige, becoming
the greatest tourist

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:51.280
city of the world.

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:56.170
Why is Paris the greatest
tourist city of the world?

00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:58.900
What is there about
its spatial strategy

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:06.600
that I've tried to spend
an hour talking about that

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:09.180
makes it so attractive?

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:18.120
Is it everybody's last
opportunity somehow?

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:21.600
It's the last
construction of cities

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:27.030
that made sense to people,
that you knew where you were,

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:30.030
that it had an enormous
degree of relatability,

00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:32.670
much like Manhattan.

00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:36.510
Manhattan's plan is
as naive, perhaps,

00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:40.140
as linking a bunch of
nodal points with streets.

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.850
Any thought about that?

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:51.010
Finn Geipel's plan
in the computation

00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:54.820
is an MIT kind of plan.

00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:59.410
He was, three years,
a visiting professor

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:01.750
before the competition.

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:10.660
It's a kind of eco-friendly
city with no particular form,

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:14.170
high degrees of--

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:17.980
there's low visibility, but
high degrees of communication

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:20.800
through telephones,
through all kinds

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:24.250
of modern electronic
conveniences.

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:31.180
What am I saying?

00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:34.130
Am I arguing that we have
lost a formula for doing

00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:36.530
things which have impact?

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:40.145
All we do is build taller
buildings with funnier shapes.

00:53:46.605 --> 00:53:49.280
STUDENT: This doesn't
answer your question,

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:54.572
but it's something that
I'm needing to go back to.

00:53:54.572 --> 00:53:56.780
When Haussmann, and you were
talking about that being

00:53:56.780 --> 00:54:00.650
in the DNA of Paris, the idea,
on things I've always thought

00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:05.150
about Haussmann that never seems
to get talked about as much is

00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:10.130
the relationship of those
streets to the medieval streets

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:10.890
and how it's--

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:12.756
I mean that's like the
big difference or one

00:54:12.756 --> 00:54:14.631
of the differences
between how the city works

00:54:14.631 --> 00:54:17.155
and how Haussmann's
intervention in Cairos works

00:54:17.155 --> 00:54:22.640
is Haussmann's streets work in
a context of the preexisting

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:25.340
streets, versus just
laying those down

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:29.710
and that being your whole
strategy for having a city.

00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:30.585
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:37.380
You'll see, on some of
the slides, some plans

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:44.670
of the Haussmann roads impacting
the existing medieval texture.

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:46.670
It's pretty ruthless.

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:50.490
I mean, you know, there's no--

00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:51.240
STUDENT: But the--

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.900
JULIAN BEINART:
--notion that the people

00:54:54.900 --> 00:55:00.720
who live under the system,
there's no replacement.

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:07.560
They pay a marginal penalty
for acquiring the land,

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:08.505
but there's no--

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:16.320
urban renewal, in this country,
produced no great evocative

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.500
features either.

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.580
My point-- it's
rather a nasty point--

00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:26.490
is that if you're
going to be brutal,

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:28.680
at least produce
something worthwhile.

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:36.030
If you're going to be
nasty, do it to some effect.

00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:40.110
It's a horrible
principle in modern life

00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:45.780
where we are inclined
to not give power.

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:52.290
I mean, Haussmann
construed the rules

00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:55.950
so that it was possible
for the Prefect

00:55:55.950 --> 00:56:00.180
of the Seine, the chief
management officer of the city,

00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:05.220
to decide which property
could be confiscated.

00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:09.150
There was no such ruling ever
in England, and certainly not

00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:13.380
in the United States,
under urban renewal.

00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:17.730
But I'm trying to make
the argument that we

00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:20.310
are in a different time.

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:24.190
We have different
commodities to work with.

00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:25.680
But there's a sense that--

00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:31.690
I know.

00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:35.050
I mean, the critique of
Haussmann's plan by architects

00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:41.140
has been fairly general and
quite right in many respects.

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:45.790
Richard [INAUDIBLE] argument
against the subdivision

00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:49.390
of the Arondissement
by Haussmann

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:56.110
in the political units and the
Banlieues being left alone,

00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:57.070
yeah.

00:56:57.070 --> 00:57:04.270
I mean, perhaps I'm talking
about a lost nostalgia

00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:10.720
for a lost unity which
we've now dispatched

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:14.950
in favor of a greater sense of
well-being about all people.

00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:23.880
I don't know if you saw a movie
called La Haine, The Hate,

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:28.815
by an American director,
I think Arthur Moskovitz.

00:57:28.815 --> 00:57:30.120
STUDENT: Mathieu Kassovitz.

00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.430
JULIAN BEINART:
Mathieu Kassovitz.

00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:33.750
Do you remember the movie?

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:35.340
STUDENT: Yeah, I'm a fan.

00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:39.300
JULIAN BEINART: It's
an extraordinary movie.

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:44.640
It follows a group of young
men from the Banlieues,

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:48.480
where they are surrounded
by sculpture in public place

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:53.320
in this rather dismal new town.

00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:57.930
They venture into Paris, into
the heart of the Old City,

00:57:57.930 --> 00:58:02.490
and start destroying
environments.

00:58:02.490 --> 00:58:05.610
They go into cocktail parties
and drink all the wine.

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:12.800
They become just an
intolerable nuisance.

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:17.190
And one of them is killed.

00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:20.030
I don't remember
how he dies, but--

00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:20.712
do you remember?

00:58:20.712 --> 00:58:21.920
STUDENT: That's the very end.

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:24.530
He gets shot by a cop,
but that's actually back

00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:25.310
in the Banlieues.

00:58:25.310 --> 00:58:26.840
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:30.440
For those of you who know
Henri Lefebvre's work,

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:35.570
the right to the town
is exemplified by that.

00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:42.440
If you have two distinct
towns, if you grow up

00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:47.920
on the wrong side
of the railroad,

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:53.530
you are disestablished in
your right to the town.

00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:58.540
In Paris, which becomes more and
more expensive, more and more,

00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:03.310
the great tourist center
of the world building

00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:11.380
more and more museums, artifacts
along the quay of the river,

00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:17.850
the curious quays of the
river, the competition

00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:21.330
is not going to work.

00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:28.170
The competition for
cities is a waste of time.

00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:32.580
The variables are too
mentally complicated, too.

00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:37.530
City planning is not a unique--
a one sort of a time exercise.

00:59:37.530 --> 00:59:39.480
The only plan I
know of a city that

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:43.260
was any good as a competition,
although it was never built,

00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:50.955
was the Green City competition
in Russia, La Ville Verte.

00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:56.250
Which we'll-- when
we deal with Russia,

00:59:56.250 --> 01:00:01.095
we will spend some time talking,
looking at that competition.

01:00:01.095 --> 01:00:10.560
But competitions are
poor models for working

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:14.370
through some of the
issues we've talked about.

01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:17.310
No wonder none of these
plans ever get to pass.

01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:21.810
Sarkozy's not
president any longer.

01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:26.260
I don't know what's going
to happen, if anything.

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:27.900
Let's look at some
of these images

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:32.460
because they tell more of
the story than my words.

01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:35.250
I hope somebody--
none of French history

01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:41.460
because I've been very
irresponsible in plundering

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.195
French history.

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:50.530
Here's the Roman crossing and
the Ile de la Cité and some

01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:54.210
images of the Bishop's palace.

01:00:54.210 --> 01:00:58.200
This is prior to Notre
Dame, the law courts

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.170
centering in the 20 acres,
in the center, almost

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:03.610
all the components
of the earlier city.

01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:04.110
Next.

01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:10.510
Here are the diagrams
that interest me.

01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:16.580
This is a 1750 plan of
Paris and its surroundings.

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.525
What are these things?

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:24.880
These are hunting grounds.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:28.870
These, somebody once said
to me that these are,

01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:32.860
if you designed a
hunting environment,

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:35.470
you would diagonalize
the road and have

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:38.350
many points of contact.

01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:42.190
This is Patte's--

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:46.930
Louis XIV, having emancipated
himself from Paris,

01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:56.230
many of these kings, yeah, were
alienated from their home city

01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:58.420
and left.

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:04.930
Peter, the great tsar
of Russia did as well.

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:12.080
Here, you can see a plan
which has as its principle

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:16.510
a set of points,
diagonals spreading,

01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:20.530
connecting to other points.

01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:31.363
The beginnings of a plan which
suggest my argument of a DNA.

01:02:34.141 --> 01:02:36.980
Le Corbusier's
Voisin plan for Paris

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:39.830
has none of that spirit at all.

01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:45.560
It's a ruthless
repositioning of modernism

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:49.535
as against the
canonical street system.

01:02:52.695 --> 01:02:53.195
Next.

01:02:58.936 --> 01:03:01.930
Well, these are
just fairly obvious.

01:03:01.930 --> 01:03:05.230
It's interesting to
contrast the plan of London.

01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:09.160
It's about the same scale
as the plan of Paris.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:15.430
Paris circumvented by walls,
one stretching further out

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:16.690
than the other.

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:27.960
London and being a free set of
connected, loosely connected,

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:34.380
villages, all encompassed
much more spread-out system

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:38.430
without the strong
definitions given

01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:40.500
by these are the
walls or the streets

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.570
or the monuments in that city.

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:45.330
This is not a
monumental city at all.

01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:50.490
It's a sprawling, elegant
microtuned environment.

01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:51.600
Next.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:57.240
Here are two images of streets
in Florence being employed

01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:02.230
for games and Marie de' Medici's
influence on the Cours la

01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.730
Reine.

01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:03.230
Next.

01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:14.050
The Cours la Reine on the left,
a place for the wealthy to have

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:19.412
sex in a broad
sense of the word.

01:04:19.412 --> 01:04:21.770
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:22.115 --> 01:04:22.615
Next.

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:29.930
The great adventure
of perspective.

01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:36.350
The capacity for
the middle class.

01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:38.790
This is Caillebotte's
great painting.

01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:41.430
It's in, I think, in the
Art Institute in Chicago.

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:49.065
The use of this
street with umbrellas.

01:04:49.065 --> 01:04:49.565
Next.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:05:00.780
The Place Royale, the
great aristocratic center.

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:04.240
The Place the Vosges
on the right, today.

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:04.740
Next.

01:05:10.765 --> 01:05:12.600
The Rue Rambuteau.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:18.810
Rambuteau's attempt
to build a street

01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:22.180
without deficit financing help.

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:22.680
Next.

01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:32.010
Haussmann and the
dark black being

01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:39.500
the elements that he inserted
into the revised system.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.000
Next.

01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:46.760
Here, you get the details of a--

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.550
this the Boulevard Sebastopol.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.800
That space is taken up at will.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:04.660
This connector, it
doesn't matter that there

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.590
are houses underneath here.

01:06:06.590 --> 01:06:11.510
The houses are just separated
away from the others

01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:14.940
in order to make
a new imposition.

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:18.200
This is about as ruthless as--

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:24.440
and it's probably the
last time in history

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:28.200
that this is being able to be
done in a democratic society.

01:06:31.655 --> 01:06:32.155
Next.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:41.410
Napoleon didn't pay
much attention to Paris.

01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:44.410
He wanted to make Paris
into a royal city.

01:06:44.410 --> 01:06:49.660
And the East-West access through
the Champs-Élysées became his

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:55.660
primary focus, the Arc de
Triomphe being the connector--

01:06:55.660 --> 01:07:01.900
not the connector--
being his great monument.

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:06.640
He also attempted to stretch
the Champs-Élysées eastward

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.410
to the Bastille.

01:07:08.410 --> 01:07:12.520
It's an extraordinary
Haussmannian device.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:15.130
This is the Avenue
Fourche, which

01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:19.900
has the wealthiest real
estate in Europe on the sides.

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:23.710
This street is
about 450 feet wide.

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:28.150
That's about twice as wide
as Commonwealth Avenue.

01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:31.540
And the Bois-- leading
to the Bois de Boulogne,

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:35.110
another one of
Haussmann's creations.

01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:37.420
Here's the river.

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:41.200
Here's the intersection of the
Champs-Élysées into the Bois du

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.415
Boulogne and the Avenue Fourche.

01:07:43.415 --> 01:07:43.915
Next.

01:07:55.378 --> 01:08:04.020
The Académie Nationale de
Musique and the access to it,

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:09.540
the monument at the end of the
wide road, Avenue de l'Opera.

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:12.030
Next.

01:08:12.030 --> 01:08:19.229
The interior of the opera by
Garnier, an extraordinary--

01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:24.149
Walter Benjamin writes
about Paris and talks

01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:29.250
about the invention of the
interior, the first time

01:08:29.250 --> 01:08:32.189
that the interior
seen as significant.

01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:37.500
And this study is done by the
students of Foucault, showing

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.960
the subdivision of
the French house

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:45.240
over time, introducing
what Benjamin calls

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:49.750
the adventure of the interior.

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:50.250
Next.

01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:58.700
Here is the ultimate.

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:03.290
There's the Boulevard
Richard-Lenoir,

01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:09.830
the ultimate expression of
destination and movement

01:09:09.830 --> 01:09:12.200
and the interior connections.

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.580
Next.

01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:16.950
The underground services
in the mid '90s,

01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:20.540
the cross-section
of a Paris street.

01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:24.695
And during one of the
exhibitions in Paris,

01:09:24.695 --> 01:09:30.810
a trip through the sewage
system was a great pleasure.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:34.300
Next.

01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:41.960
The Banlieues, here is the
taking down of the dues,

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.930
tax houses on the--

01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:50.569
where the octroi was
collected and the conditions

01:09:50.569 --> 01:09:52.199
in the Banelieues.

01:09:52.199 --> 01:09:52.699
Next.

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:56.990
In the street is war.

01:09:56.990 --> 01:10:02.140
1848, the barricaded
streets in the center of--

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:03.110
on the east of--

01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:11.030
on the east of Paris, here
are the barricade lines.

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:19.440
The use of this street is war.

01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:25.930
Next.

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:29.620
1872, and the
two-month-long occupation

01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:34.720
of the Western of the
Eastern part of Paris,

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:37.750
again, with the
use of barricades.

01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:40.990
Barricades slow down
troops, and people

01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:45.940
in the adjacent buildings
can fire down on the troops

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:47.440
when they slow down.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.850
Next.

01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:58.515
1968, and again the use
of this street in protest.

01:10:58.515 --> 01:10:59.015
Next.

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.470
OK.
