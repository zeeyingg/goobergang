JULIAN BEINART:
This is the third

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.810
in the last of the three
models of city form

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.430
that I've been putting forward.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:49.030
To repeat these models, which is
deduced in classes between 1956

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.110
and 1980 by Kevin Lynch and
published in A Theory of Good

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.120
City Form, I've adapted them
and added an enormous amount

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.980
of them subsequently.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.050
But the basis of the
idea was to put forward

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.160
some generalizations
about the form of cities,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.040
and try to see to what extent
they had validity in relation

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.010
to current urbanism.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.860
If the cosmic model
paid attention

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.765
to the regularity of
nature through the study

00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:41.250
of the ecclesiastical
systems, if the machine

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.460
model preoccupied it with the
speed with which you could

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.390
build new places,
and started off

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.140
at the beginnings of modern
commercialism and colonization,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:06.570
the appreciation of nature
as a model for cities

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.340
is even vaguer than the others.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.250
Nature has always been
difficult to define.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.920
Although it's palpable and
existentially accurate,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:33.230
its breadth is so large, and
it needs a lot of acquisition

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.360
in order to transform it
into a viable theory of form

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.750
of this form of the city.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.550
Not that it hasn't been used.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.390
In the class today, we'll look
at the examples of urban form

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:58.280
which have set forth principles
of natural accommodation.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.605
I start with a piece from
a German town planner.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:18.450
First war-- 1948 this man
who had been a Nazi, a regime

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.930
architect of the
city of Stettin,

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.590
says the following
in his 1948 book

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.760
Organische Stadtbaukunst,
Organische Baukunst,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.420
Organische Kultur,
which in English means

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.560
organic city planning, organic
architecture, organic culture.

00:03:44.238 --> 00:03:47.027
AUDIENCE: What's the
name of the city?

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:48.610
JULIAN BEINART:
Forget about the city.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.440
It's unimportant.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.600
Stettin, it's a northern
city in Germany.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.950
The importance is
his proposition.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.370
The metaphors in his book
are familiar-- the branching

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.170
of a tree, the structure
of a leaf, the human lung.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.950
He condemns all
inorganic city forms,

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.579
be they simple grids, the
machine model, or products

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.610
to the Grand Manner,
the cosmic model.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.630
He says they are static,
which is nonsense.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.970
He faults advocates
of linear cities

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.370
for presenting this model as
a complete urban solution.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.070
In itself, the linear
city is incomplete.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.270
City expansion is organic when
it occurs along radial lines

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.133
without losing power.

00:04:44.133 --> 00:04:53.500
A radial-- an organic town
is not clearly described,

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.670
but city expansion
is organic when

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.820
it occurs along radial
lines without losing

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.330
its interpretal power.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.760
And analogical to
the human body,

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.330
it would be like the heart
being able to sustain

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.050
an extension of arms and
the legs in the human body

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.263
beyond measure.

00:05:13.263 --> 00:05:14.305
Of course, it's nonsense.

00:05:14.305 --> 00:05:17.140
It actually it doesn't
work that way, certainly

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.260
not in the organicism
of the human body.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.170
The heart is in the place where
it is for reasons of geometry,

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.300
as well as reasons
of performance.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.860
I conclude, "The city
will stop growing when it

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.250
has filled its natural space."

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.730
Here, again the term
"natural" is used loosely.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:50.070
What is the natural
space of a city--

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.010
one which is 20
million people in size,

00:05:53.010 --> 00:06:00.870
or one which is the size of
Springfield, Massachusetts?

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.545
It's nonsense.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:12.580
He ends up by saying,
"The freedom of appearance

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.100
is a precondition of
all natural beauty."

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.660
We will then discussing
the sea attributes given

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.710
to nature, which are beautiful.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.090
In this crazy phenomenon of
biomorphism in architecture,

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.080
in one of the textbooks
published by Yale University

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.590
Press--

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.270
God forbid that they should
publish books like that,

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.490
you are instructed to avoid the
rectangle because it doesn't

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:51.260
perform for human beings as
much as the curved surface does.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.170
It's nonsense.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:07:01.000
They are metaphors to be
gained from organic material

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.800
and organic processes, which
are close to rectangular form

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.040
as it is to bent form.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:16.030
What is by and large argued
is that man has the capacity,

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.220
or should have the
right to borrow

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.540
processes and forms which have
worked in previous conditions.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.400
This is an element of history
and an element of science

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.740
which we abide by.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.140
How selective you
are and how much

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:41.410
learning it requires to choose
a particular biomorphic example

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.050
is open to question.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.120
It is not categorical at all.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.810
The piece I've handed
out to you today--

00:07:53.810 --> 00:08:00.700
I haven't got a copy myself,

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.400
Here's some examples of
cases which I'm going

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.520
to go into in some detail.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.130
At the top of the
first page, it tries

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.400
to set out some of
the characteristics

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.250
of an organic system.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.810
And then it tries to
argue for the depiction

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:26.300
of these protocols in
the form of settlement.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.670
The diagram below
from the regional plan

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:37.929
of New York 1923, which
says, "The possible state

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:43.179
of the future in which each
part serves its logical function

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:47.500
in support of wholesome
activity and good living."

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.690
And a version of Patrick
Geddes' linear valley section,

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:59.150
which I'll go into
later, is below that.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.200
What is the appropriate
space that something

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.400
has in a natural system?

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.540
Patrick Geddes, the great
Scottish biologist and town

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:15.860
planner, argues for in
this valley section,

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.490
which is on the next part.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.560
For him, there is
a natural logic

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.180
in the location of quarrying
at a distance from the water.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.630
That a fishing village
would be next to the water,

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.240
and that cattle farming
would be somewhere

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.440
between market gardening
and arable farming.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:41.110
In the same way, he tries to
build a section through a town.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:45.970
Iron and steel far from
the, center from the port.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.330
What locates the furrier
between a woodland goods

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:58.220
store and, I think, a
timber and paper merchant?

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.320
It's not explainable.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.940
It's only explainable
according to a geography

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.850
of purpose, which is assumed
by this man at the time.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:15.770
As you'll see, when we talk
more about theories which

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.910
derive from the social
sciences, from economics,

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.770
they are economic
theories, von Thunen

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.350
and others which locate
things in a certain degree

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:30.260
of relationship
with other things.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:35.630
To argue that this is a
natural state, I debunk.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:41.260
It's not the natural state
of a shopping center in 2013

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.790
in the United States.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.240
I will share in the case study
the Tennessee Valley Authority,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.760
which I'll do later
in this class,

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:55.760
that the conception of nature,
which Roosevelt and Benton

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.360
MacKaye and Lewis Mumford
and others, regionalists

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.670
and transcendentalists had
in mind in 1933 for seven

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:11.510
American states, has
been modified constantly

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:15.510
since then to today
when there are protests

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:20.360
every few months against
the use of nuclear power,

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.610
against the Manhattan
Project, all of which

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.640
locate within the TVA idea.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:43.690
The next page is from a book by
an Englishman, D'Arcy Thompson,

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.810
called Growth and
Form, which argues

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:53.740
that the organic
species, as these fish,

00:11:53.740 --> 00:12:01.900
do not achieve a new form every
time they change marginally.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:06.130
He shows that within these
parameters of geometry,

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.860
these transformations
take place.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.390
However, in the natural
system, there you

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.660
reach the threshold beyond
which if you change,

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.120
you start a new entity.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.240
You don't keep on
growing and growing.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.450
Ants don't get to be
as large as elephants.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:33.450
Cities do apparently
grow to large sizes

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:38.400
without distinctively or
disassociating themselves

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.980
from smaller, newer items.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.980
This is the velocity
of new towns.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.480
New town construction
follows the organic model

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.370
more than generalized
metropolitan expansion.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:03.820
The next pages deal with
stages of the Tennessee Valley

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:10.600
Authority, which I'll go
through with you in due course.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.640
They say a few things
about the organic idea,

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:21.160
and then followed
by four major case

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.410
studies of its application.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.730
An organism is an
autonomous individual.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.570
Secondly, it has a
definite boundary.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.895
Thirdly, it has a
definite size and shape.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:48.640
The enlargement of an organic
item beyond its normal size

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:55.600
and appropriateness of
size increase is comedic.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.530
If you enlarge a mouse to
the size of something that

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.280
parades down the street
at the Macy's Day Parade,

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.260
it is humorous.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.450
It is not a mouse any longer.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.300
It's the human brain,
which has activated

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.400
an unnatural premise--

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:18.640
that of rampant enlargement
of an item beyond.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:24.130
Reduction in natural size
and enormous enlargement

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:28.630
to all the products of the
human brain, not of nature.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.360
If the human brain is part of
nature, of course everything

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:32.860
is natural.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:43.050
It's interesting to argue as
to whether the human being,

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:49.110
as a superorganism like ants,
does things in similar ways.

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:54.600
How do ants find a new site
for their queen mother ant.

00:14:57.869 --> 00:15:02.420
Do you know the phenomenon
of the pheromone?

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.970
What is a pheromone?

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.160
It's what an ant
secretes when he wishes

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.690
to make a mark on the ground.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:17.470
The way a site is chosen
is through a decision

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:23.740
made by the community to choose
a particular cavity which

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.250
has the most pheromones
secreted on it.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:30.730
Each person has the
right to choose a site,

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.750
but the site which has the
most pheromone secreted on it

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:40.660
becomes the maternal site for
the leader of the community.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.260
The grammaticus in
the Roman argument

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.910
uses a measuring stick,
a geometrical measuring

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:52.420
[INAUDIBLE] for
casting a shadow.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.690
The astrobiologist
in the cosmic model

00:15:55.690 --> 00:16:01.390
uses a system of rules derived
presumably from nature.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.450
I think Feng Shui
is a derivation

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:10.880
of natural observation of
sun and stars and so on.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.940
So in that sense, ants, who are
probably the most sophisticated

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:20.110
of the superorganisms
use techniques

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.490
for locating a new
city in similar ways

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.860
than the human beings does.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:35.970
We could secrete
pheromones as voters

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:39.960
and decide on the best
site for a new capital

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.830
for the United States,
unlikely though that would be.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.520
This very tension is
[INAUDIBLE] in the notion

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.690
of the organic unit,
which is turned over

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:58.320
into the organic
settlement idea.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.540
It's best explained
by an example

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.310
from Patrick Geddes in India.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:10.560
Patrick Geddes is asked by
the Maharajah of Bahadur

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.260
to do something
about the malaria

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.190
in the town of Balrampur.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:20.700
Balrampur has water
tanks which are polluted.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.690
And the primary impulse
by the maharajah

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:29.670
is to follow the British example
and get rid of the tanks--

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:31.815
to use what is
called urban surgery.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.400
Geddes says no.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.670
There's something good
about these tanks.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.900
So he says, let us rather
employ old men to clean them

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:51.380
every day setting up a
daily ritual of cleaning,

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.510
of cleansing, which
will be picked up

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.730
by the kids in the town.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:01.520
They will deviate
from the ritual.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.610
They will increase the
size of the activity,

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.800
and you will have
no more malaria.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:13.820
So the notion is to use the
organic model to retain.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.570
Geddes does this in his
plan for the reconstruction

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:20.000
of Balrampur.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.280
He says narrow the streets.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.610
Use the space
alongside the buildings

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.460
to create greenery and trees.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.530
This will help the
health of the settlement.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:41.870
So he looks at the chowk, the
traditional enclosed linear

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.900
market inside blocks.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.480
And he says, instead
of taking these away,

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.520
let's built on them.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.130
Quite the opposite
of what Corbusier

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:56.450
does in Chandigarh
in 1949, where

00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:00.590
he uses a sector
form which is derived

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:07.940
either from his work in Bogota
or from the work of Clarence

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:13.460
Stein and Henry Wright
in the American version

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.380
of the organic settlement.

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:31.450
I've said before that
the organic [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:36.700
form reaches limits or
thresholds at which time

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.230
the change in form is radical.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:45.640
The organic idea has
differentiated parts.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.560
These parts are
in close contact,

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:53.530
whether they work together in
from each other in subtle ways.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.450
If I were to improve
the human body,

00:19:55.450 --> 00:20:00.070
I would put the heart
lower down in the body.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:05.560
As we have grown in size,
particularly American men,

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.180
the distance from the heart
to the toes becomes enlarged.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:15.580
And one of the phenomenal
problems with diabetes

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:20.425
is that the vein system from
the heart down to the legs

00:20:20.425 --> 00:20:25.230
is at such a large distance
that you get problems

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:26.770
with your feet.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:31.750
And in severe cases, you have
to have your feet amputated.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.720
So nature doesn't always work.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.050
Obviously, we die,
which an organic model

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:42.190
is something which is
difficult to take account of.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:45.190
The towns then die.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:48.520
Yes, in pre-modern
times they did die.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:55.390
We spoke to our friends who
are not here today, on Tuesday,

00:20:55.390 --> 00:21:01.560
about [INAUDIBLE] and
the towns that did die.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.890
It's not clear to
me that urban death

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:11.680
is as finite a phenomenon as
human death or organic death.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.050
We all know we're going to die.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:17.290
Detroit doesn't know whether
it's going to die or not.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:21.690
It's lingering in
perpetual disease.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.940
A perpetual disease
may be a prolongation

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:31.960
of the inertia of the settlement
ever since its first form.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.710
I come back again to
Marx's quotation, which

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:39.160
I said in the first
class, where he

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.880
said one of the things about the
creation of human settlements

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.480
is, for the first time, the
distinction between what

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.860
is outside and what is inside.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:55.900
For a long time, what
is outside with nature

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.190
and it was dangerous.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:05.320
Exeunt [? leones-- ?]
there are lion out there.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.850
Exeunt-- some Latin
phrases, which

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:13.660
describe this
phenomenon regarding

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:20.530
nature as both
beneficial and dangerous.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:24.400
To survive requires an
understanding of nature

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.800
as both beauty and the beast--

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:34.180
when the sun shines after the
floods in Egypt of the Nile.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:41.800
Idiosyncracity becomes a major
form of culture of phenomenon.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:47.950
You get a town like
Heliopolis On the other hand,

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:52.620
if the flood destroys
half of your settlement,

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.710
because you can't predict
the flood's behavior,

00:22:55.710 --> 00:23:00.300
you're dealing with
an untamed beast.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.050
In some strange way, we
have come full circle

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.300
around our
appreciation of nature.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.200
We are with climate
change, both facing

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.750
on the products of
the wonders of nature,

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:16.770
but for the first
time, as a universe,

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:20.700
perhaps facing the
beast-like qualities

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.395
of hurricanes and floods.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.990
So human beings have
always posited, in my view,

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:34.200
between a romantic appreciation
of nature independent

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.060
of things.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:43.080
The closing of the agricultural
communal lands in England

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.140
prior to the
Industrial Revolution,

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:51.240
in order to make land for
parks or for the wealthy,

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:58.110
took away the living
substance from poor people,

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:03.300
but created the great provenance
of British romantic parks.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:11.620
Who decides on nature being
good or bad in that respect?

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.900
Nature's value-free.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.810
That's what makes it
so difficult for one

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:21.670
to easily assign value
to natural circumstance.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:31.480
Let's look very quickly
at two more phenomena.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:47.370
The two are-- the first
one is fear of homeostasis.

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:51.020
One of the major characteristics
of a human or any animal

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:54.365
organism is its capacity
to repair itself.

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:00.260
When it's too hot, as in
this room this morning,

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.440
you start sweating to cool
down your temperature.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.440
You don't need to turn
on a machine-like switch.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.230
It happens.

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:12.610
It's built into the
organism's performance.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:16.330
Homeostasis is an
important phenomenon.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:20.120
I've used it at times to
explain urban behavior,

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:25.690
such as the notion that perhaps
the return in the United

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.360
States to the
center of the city,

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.210
after years of
suburban expansion,

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.760
is a homeostatic phenomenon.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.720
There is something in
the organic model which

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.940
says if you stretch
resources too far,

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:45.250
you will return to an
original state of balance.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.140
The other one is optimum size.

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:53.320
The organic model of
an elephant is easily

00:25:53.320 --> 00:26:00.340
understood by virtue of its
major size as a male elephant.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:05.140
What is the optimum
size of a dinner party?

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:10.060
What is the optimum size
of most social activity?

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:15.490
You'll recall my using
Dunbar's theory of 150 people

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:20.075
as the appropriate community
for the rapid increase of brain

00:26:20.075 --> 00:26:20.575
size.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.030
What about the history
of optimal size?

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:41.470
Aristotle, 30,000.

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:51.870
Leonardo, 50,000.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:58.950
Ebenezer Howard, 1905
and 1920 Letchworth

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:05.030
and Welwyn Garden City, 30,000.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:06.970
The first of the
British new towns,

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:16.230
30,000, second [? mark II ?]
generation 50,000,

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:21.170
next 100,000.

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:29.280
Milton Keynes,
250,000 is an optimum.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.110
What do you read
that graph as saying?

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.430
What determines the
optimal size of a city?

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:45.140
Come on, you must have--

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.130
you've thought about these
things in some way or other

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:48.910
before.

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:50.692
Have a guess.

00:27:50.692 --> 00:27:54.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] geographic
boundaries [INAUDIBLE]??

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:02.610
JULIAN BEINART: Los Angeles
has geographic boundaries?

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:11.490
It started off as a [INAUDIBLE]
small community in 1781.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:12.090
Yeah, please.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:16.650
AUDIENCE: How we can communicate
or transport each other?

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.830
If there's technology, we
can do it for further away,

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:22.230
and the boundary of
the city [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.120
JULIAN BEINART: Yes.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:33.810
You could do that here, and
it still remains 30,000.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:37.410
I don't know how to answer
this question absolutely.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:41.130
I can make a couple of guesses.

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:49.120
The one has to do
with urban health.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.440
If you have high
rates of mortality

00:28:54.440 --> 00:29:03.410
and low rates of
birthrate accomplishment,

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:07.790
you probably end up with
something like 30,000 people

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:14.765
as being the largest number
you can secure in general.

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:22.670
I mean, it took from Rome
at the birth of Christ

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:28.350
to London in 1850 for a city
to be a million people in size.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:32.070
There are guesses in fact
that Angkor Wat reached

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.440
a couple of hundred thousand.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.390
There were cities in
India which perhaps did.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:40.770
But the basic
proposition might have

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:47.730
to do with reproduction
of population.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:59.980
There's also a
comparative index.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:05.860
The world's population is
probably increasing and doing

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:11.180
this is with the Industrial
Revolution being here.

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:16.880
So there's a notion that we
constitute an approximate size,

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.340
at least to optimum size,
based on the social context

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:26.470
of demography and of
other cultural phenomena.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:30.100
Yes, absolutely, you
have to be able to move

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.245
one part to another.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:47.990
What is it in our contemporary
ethos and scientific model

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:52.610
of life that allows us to build
cities of 20 million people?

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:09.105
AUDIENCE: Penicillin and drugs?

00:31:09.105 --> 00:31:14.840
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah, I mean,
since the Industrial Revolution

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.555
the world changed
phenomenologically

00:31:17.555 --> 00:31:19.590
in almost every respect.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:23.480
That's why I will start
teaching the second section

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.590
of this class largely beginning
with the Industrial Revolution.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:30.800
The rest is a waste of time.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.120
Not a waste of time.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.370
I'm exaggerating of course.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:38.450
But in one class, one
can't do everything.

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:43.070
My preference is to start
with the major changes which

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:49.110
took place with urbanization
and industrialization.

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:52.940
So let's leave optimum
size theory for a moment.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.420
It's a strange phenomenon.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.880
We still have a
natural inclination

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:06.380
to order our world according
to certain basic rules.

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:11.930
In the British New Towns of
Ebenezer Howard, Letchworth

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:16.280
and Welwyn Garden City,
Raymond Unwin, the architect

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:21.050
and collaborator said
12 units per acre

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:24.110
is an ideal distribution
of population.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:31.860
What measures 12 units
at 12 houses per acre,

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:36.870
as an optimum for whom, under
what conditions, and so on.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:44.330
So just some
characteristic form tools

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:48.530
which emanate from this
model of organic item.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.530
Each community should be a
separate social and spatial

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:58.075
unit as autonomous as possible.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:06.510
Number 2, the community
should be balanced.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:10.350
The idea of a healthy
community is heterogeneous.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:15.000
Again, the modeling it after
the human being, the heart

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.250
and the pancreas are
not the same thing.

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:18.990
They have different shapes.

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:20.670
They have different entities.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:21.900
They work.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.420
You can't have a human--

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:29.490
you can't have an organic
element which is singular.

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.620
It has to be multiverse.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:36.810
And the nuclear family in
many of these settlements

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:40.620
is taken as a model with these
differentiated supporting

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.050
roles.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:50.370
In Sunnyside Gardens,
the development,

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:57.440
which the American Garden
City people did in the Bronx,

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:02.900
Mumford claims that there
were 116 mechanics, 79 office

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:08.900
workers, 55 small tradesmen,
five chauffeurs, and 49

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:14.449
salesmen, plus architects,
writers, intellectuals as well.

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:17.550
This, he was happy to--

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:18.840
he lived there.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:23.150
He was happy to testify
this as a good town

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:24.485
based on its balance.

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:33.449
Seldom does the organic system
produce indefinite similarity.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.909
So the argument that
it is a model in nature

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:49.860
for support of systems in
harmony with each other

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.670
is interesting.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:55.650
Why the nuclear
family should still

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:59.760
be the model for
urbanization, given

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:04.080
that we have large numbers of
people who are not married,

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:09.600
people who choose not
to marry, for example.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:14.550
Plus if we wish to extend the
model to a universal model,

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:18.930
what success have we had
in nurturing each other

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:21.060
as a universe?

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.570
We cannot, in facing the
fundamental challenge

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:28.485
of climate change,
come to agreement about

00:35:28.485 --> 00:35:33.150
[? sustenization. ?]

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:37.560
One has to remember that
it was as recent in 1920

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.310
that Woodrow Wilson,
the American president,

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:44.850
went to Paris, and was
received by the largest

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.700
crowd in the history
of Paris, which

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:52.920
is a large crowd, because he
proposed that the world take

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:56.130
account of its
organization and prevent

00:35:56.130 --> 00:36:01.530
wars, such as the
dastardly 1914 to 1918

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:06.660
war, which the world
had just experienced.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:13.340
So the idea that there
is something organically

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:19.740
universal about co-operative
systems is not true.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:24.110
Maybe at the scale of a single
family, if it works out,

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.770
if you love each other--

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:31.550
which more and more, seeing that
50% of Americans are divorced,

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:40.160
no longer seems to be the model
as described by organicism.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:49.365
The neighborhood
unit, Clarence Perry

00:36:49.365 --> 00:36:54.640
divined an organic sub-model
called the neighborhood

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:59.290
unit for the regional
plan of New York in 1923,

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:01.930
I think it was.

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:07.240
A neighborhood unit, again,
is organic in its nature.

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:12.340
It argues that a community
should be the size of a quarter

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:16.540
mile walk of a child to school.

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:19.540
Again, the organic
model comes in.

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:24.910
What is the species which has
the least protection naturally?

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:27.460
A child.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:32.290
So you'll use that as
the model for building

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:35.350
a circular community
around the primary school.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.830
The fact that people
take their kids

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:43.950
to school by
automobile, the fact

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:48.120
that people choose schools
in a democracy based

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:55.080
upon the quality of
school, based on the fact

00:37:55.080 --> 00:38:01.830
that the linear model doesn't
allow one to use this model

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:07.200
is distinctive, and so on and
so on, renders this model.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.740
But Radburn, New
Jersey, was based

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:15.750
on the quarter mile walking
distance to schools,

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:20.320
as well as Greenbelt Maryland,
and the American greenbelt

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:20.820
towns.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.710
160 acres around a school.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:45.820
The next growth optimum size
is the greenbelt. If you

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:52.060
have an optimum size, you can
protect it from the forces that

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.810
work against optimization--

00:38:55.810 --> 00:39:03.490
nasty forces like the market,
developers, politicians.

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:10.290
When we were working
on Chandigarh

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:17.910
as recently as
1990-something, we

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:23.730
noticed that land was being sold
north of the Capitol Complex,

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:27.760
in the path of this wonderful
diagram that Corbusier

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.260
[INAUDIBLE] made of
this town stretching

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:36.860
in an untrammeled fashion
towards the Himalayas.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:39.800
What we discovered
were real estate signs

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:45.610
for politicians selling land
illegally in this sacred area.

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:51.830
We needed a studio with
the Cambridge University

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:53.510
in England.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:56.540
We found that the
greenbelt around Cambridge

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.240
had, of course,
increased land values,

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.720
and Cambridge significantly
had been pocketed

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.650
with political development.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:09.800
The notion which
Ebenezer Howard so

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.850
favored in the city of
Adelaide, for building parks

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:17.780
around the center
of the city, has not

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:21.600
proven to be another solution.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.495
First of all, how do
you keep the land green?

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.190
You need a maintenance system.

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:38.424
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:38.424 --> 00:40:42.150
JULIAN BEINART: This is a
small example from a mining

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:44.880
town in South Africa.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.000
Gold is discovered--
gold and uranium.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:57.010
Here's a center built. An open
space is left around the center

00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:00.120
so it might grow.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.970
And housing starts here.

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:05.580
This is a hot climate.

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.250
No money in the
design of the town

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:12.300
has been invested in
maintaining an open space.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.940
It's a dusty, horrible bubble.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:22.920
It prevents the centers from
growing, and it's a silly idea.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:32.130
To be a junior teacher
at Cambridge University,

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:36.990
if you are married, you have
to live beyond the greenbelt.

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:39.690
The British have not
built enough roads

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:43.640
to take care of your
commutation every day.

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:50.100
If you've got two cars,
which you probably

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:53.820
haven't at that
stage in your career,

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.850
the wife has to carry--
you can't afford

00:41:56.850 --> 00:42:01.230
to live in Cambridge, because
the university has preoccupied

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:04.770
most of the land,
and raised the rent

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:09.030
levels of the rest in the
center to such a degree

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:13.160
that you can't
afford to live there.

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.120
So the greenbelt
has turned out to be

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:19.560
a weak weapon against expansion

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.670
I'm generalizing.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:26.850
There are cases where
protective legislation has

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:29.040
changed the pattern of growth.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:32.220
But the greenbelt as
a generalized idea

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.890
is not sufficient in itself.

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:42.740
There's also two other items
with these settlements.

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:49.190
There's a fascination with the
organic quality of production.

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:51.860
Why we believe
that the food which

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:56.690
we buy on stalls next to
the road outside of town

00:42:56.690 --> 00:43:01.160
are better and healthier than
food, water in the supermarket

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.260
is beyond me.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:07.550
Perhaps the cost is less
and they seem fresher.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:08.840
Maybe they are.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:13.400
Sometimes, they are directly
tilled from the gardens

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:17.120
of the farm next door.

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.170
But there is something
assumed to be

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:27.440
natural in the conjunction of
a producer and a purchaser.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:32.510
This is an archaic
form of goodness.

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:35.930
That if you buy from a
farmer without a middleman--

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:40.100
that the middleman is
an alien phenomenon

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:44.330
in the natural system, the
heart sends blood directly

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:45.590
to the toes.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:47.750
He doesn't need support systems.

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:50.420
Maybe I don't know human
biology well enough.

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:54.650
Maybe there's this halfway
heart in your knees

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:58.850
which take care of
the support system.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:07.710
Sometimes these things happen
through complex instruments

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:10.740
of market and culture.

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:13.620
There are now 124
farmers markets

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:16.140
in the County of Los Angeles--

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:22.320
124, spontaneously developed
without any government

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:26.180
intervention, without
any government subsidy.

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:30.150
Just simple rules about
where you may create

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:31.965
a weekly farmer's market.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.350
The attraction of buying
at a farmers market,

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:43.414
as opposed to buying at a
supermarket, are complex.

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:47.830
I have a thesis student
at the moment working--

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:55.120
doing a thesis in Seoul, where
the advent of the shopping mall

00:44:55.120 --> 00:45:00.550
has caused havoc with the
informal market system.

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:02.500
And this is true
also in the case

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:06.040
in Hong Kong, which somebody
is trying to replicate

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:07.780
a traditional market system.

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:21.530
These are pointers to elements
of goodness and difficulty

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:28.140
in the blatant acceptance
of organic systems.

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:34.565
One last one is the
question of social equity.

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:45.870
There's a long
tradition of believing

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:51.570
that the value of land
or activity in the city

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:55.330
is not the function
of individuals.

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:57.300
It is the function
of the community's

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.760
activities and investment.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:04.590
Therefore, a private
lot should not

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:14.280
be the beneficiary
of communal growth.

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:20.340
This philosophy was made
explicit in this country

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:26.580
by a man called Henry George,
a middle 19th century economist

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:30.540
philosopher who wrote a book
called Progress and Poverty.

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:35.460
The Lincoln Land Institute
here in Cambridge

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.860
is a follower of the
Henry Georgian view.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.680
It raises difficulties.

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:52.360
In English town planning up
till reasonably recent times,

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.870
there was always a conflict
between the payment

00:46:54.870 --> 00:47:00.270
of betterment or the
penalizing of people.

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:06.960
For instance, if I
have a gas station

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:11.880
on a normal arterial
road and a decision

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:17.390
is made to build a
national highway,

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:20.060
and I'm given the
right to put my gas

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:23.870
station on the
national highway, I

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:31.400
contributed nothing to the world
to pay me for this goodness.

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.160
But can I be penalized?

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:41.270
Can I be given a negative
option on its location?

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:44.060
It's much like if
you decide to wash

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:47.180
my car without my permission.

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.516
Am I entitled to pay you or not?

00:47:49.516 --> 00:47:51.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:52.950
No.

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:54.970
JULIAN BEINART: No.

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:57.250
You're right, no.

00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:02.770
On the other hand,
if I own a gas

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:07.210
station on an arterial road,
and the government decides

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:14.460
to close the road, I mean, am
I entitled to compensation?

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:23.260
These are all elements
in the land change system

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.960
that we now have rules about.

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:31.540
But according to Henry
George, and before him even

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:32.815
our great Abraham Lincoln--

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.600
I won't be able to find his
quotation, has this notion

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:45.760
that land is only
a temporary gift.

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:49.450
That the communal work done
by the government-- of course,

00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:52.720
Lincoln is a big
government sponsor.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:56.740
It is a strange idea,
seeing he was a Republican.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:07.580
But the organic model
in Sunnyside Gardens,

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:14.180
for instance, the
communal value increase

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.940
of the property over
a certain period

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:22.775
is returned to the seller of
a particular unit of land.

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:30.168
Let's carry on and see if we
can get through this stuff

00:49:30.168 --> 00:49:30.710
more quickly.

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:37.925
There's also an organic
model, as I mentioned before.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:46.520
Interest in
non-orthogonal forms--

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:49.250
radial patterns,
bounded units, focus

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:52.730
centers,
anti-geometrical layouts,

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:56.840
irregularly curving organic
shapes, natural materials,

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:57.560
and so on.

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:06.690
Three years after he
designed Central Park,

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:09.750
Olmsted laid out a
piece of flat prairie

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:14.790
land a couple of
miles outside Chicago.

00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:16.920
He suggests, and
I quote from him,

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:19.680
"Curved streets
suggest and imply

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:23.250
leisure, contemplativeness,
and happy tranquility.

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:28.710
In contrast is
straight streets, which

00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:32.550
imply eagerness to press forward
without looking to the right

00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:33.780
or left.

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:38.550
Riverside was called
a suburban village."

00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:42.060
I will show you in the
slides the plan of Riverside.

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:48.150
Its separate parts are all
designated by curved roads.

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:55.280
In 1873, the Northern
Pacific Railroad

00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:01.270
asked Olmsted to do a layout
for a new town of Tacoma,

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:04.620
Washington, a plan
that exploited

00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:08.130
the topography of the site.

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:11.880
According to some
reporter, "Olmsted's plan

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:15.510
was the most fantastic plan
of a town that was ever seen.

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:19.470
There wasn't a straight line,
a right angle, or a corner lot.

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:22.200
The blocks were shaped
like melons, pears,

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.150
and sweet potatoes.

00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:28.770
One block shaped like a banana
with 3,000 feet in length

00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:31.050
and had 250 plot.

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:34.560
It was a pretty plan for a
park, but condemned itself

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.210
for a town."

00:51:36.210 --> 00:51:40.560
It was never built.

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:44.025
Let's look at some of
these individual cases.

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:52.570
Patrick Geddes was a
young Scottish biologist

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:56.650
who went to work for one
of the great 19th century

00:51:56.650 --> 00:52:01.870
biologists, Thomas Huxley,
and according to legend,

00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:07.570
deciphered the mechanism by
which a frog's eye operates.

00:52:07.570 --> 00:52:11.200
He didn't get the benefit
of it, so Huxley did.

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:19.510
But Geddes went on to be
interested in urbanism.

00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:25.060
He is regarded as one
of the great minds

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:27.030
in urbanistic history--

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:28.400
modern urbanistic history.

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:35.170
Charles Darwin said,
"I have read several

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:38.440
of your biological papers
with very great interest

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:41.260
and I've formed, if you'll
permit me to say so,

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:44.020
a high opinion in
your abilities."

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:48.550
Einstein, Rabindranath
Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi all

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:53.050
speak highly of,
Lewis Mumford says

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:59.710
of Geddes, one of the truly
seminal minds, and so on.

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:04.870
I'm just going to go through a
couple of ideas of Geddes' that

00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:11.260
emerge from our understanding
of the best uses of nature.

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:16.450
First of all, he believes
in the civic survey.

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:22.150
He [INAUDIBLE] in India to
do a plan for a new town that

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:23.440
has trouble.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:27.490
He insists on the town
first doing a civic survey.

00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:31.030
A civic survey is
not only a method

00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:36.260
of capturing what exists
accurately on the land.

00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:42.550
It is a way of revealing the
possibilities of retaining

00:53:42.550 --> 00:53:46.460
the pieces that work.

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:53.000
In his plan for Balrampur,
the civic survey

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.390
shows what is
existing in the land.

00:53:56.390 --> 00:54:02.690
He then decides to extract
from those the elements that

00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:06.140
need improvement, the
elements that can be retained,

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:08.990
the elements that
can be built on.

00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:20.150
Secondly, he believes in the
synoptic version of nature,

00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:23.210
getting multiple
visions to coincide

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:27.170
with similar ends similar
to native elements of life

00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:28.610
in nature.

00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:32.390
For him in nature, it is
possible for all things

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:37.940
to come together, and for
us to understand that.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:42.710
He uses a diagram from the
French philosopher Laplace,

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:48.920
which is a right angle crossing
in which the corners are

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:53.090
acts, deeds, dreams, facts.

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:58.280
If you begin this piece of
paper along these vertical and

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:02.330
horizontal lines, each of
them comes into each other.

00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:06.230
He then breaks down the
components of each sector.

00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:09.350
What is it about
dreams of the imagined?

00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:14.400
What is it about the imagination
that has to do with work?

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.730
It's a diagram which
a child can play with.

00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:24.590
But it's, for me anyway, more
of an indication of his notion

00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:27.995
that simultaneity is
a fundamental property

00:55:27.995 --> 00:55:33.020
of organicism, and can
be utilized effectively

00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:34.850
in practice.

00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:39.910
He's asked to do a plan for the
Hebrew University of Jerusalem

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:42.410
after 1917.

00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:45.110
And his son-in-law,
who was an architect,

00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:47.210
does a plan with him.

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:49.940
Again, everything about the
plan of the universities,

00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:56.150
which I show you in these
slides, deals with synopticism.

00:55:56.150 --> 00:56:01.460
At the center of the university
plan is a domed space.

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:03.710
Why does he use the dome?

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:06.740
He says the dome is the
only architectural form that

00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:12.590
is revered by Christians,
Jews, and Muslims.

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:15.590
So even an architectural
form, which

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:21.060
resonates with different
often conflicting cultures,

00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:23.300
he says there's no
reason for these people

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:28.430
to kill themselves over
things like a dome.

00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:31.520
The fingers, which
move out from the dome

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:35.450
locate aspects of
the knowledge system

00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:39.020
of the university in
sequence, one after the other.

00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:42.710
For you to get from
architecture to the center,

00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:45.740
you have to go through biology.

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:49.250
Much like the folded the
diagram of a piece of paper

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:52.910
which connects dreams
and work and play

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:57.193
and ideas, this
planned university

00:56:57.193 --> 00:57:02.710
is an attempt to resonate
along the same system.

00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:08.450
MIT's perhaps closer in
its stupid grid system

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:12.290
to this synopticism
than anything

00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:15.260
that Geddes ever envisioned.

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:32.000
He put something called the
[INAUDIBLE] tower in Edinburgh

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.580
to take people up into
the top of the tower

00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:36.470
to look down at the town.

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:39.800
For him, understanding and
learning about the town

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:44.150
was an important element
in civic education.

00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:46.400
You needed to know
about the town

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:53.540
in order to fulfill your role as
a member of a community, which

00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:56.030
had something to
do with the change

00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:59.350
of the shape of the place.

00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:05.590
He proposed things
like civic exhibitions.

00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:09.860
He made a civic exhibition
of the ideal town.

00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:16.780
It was damaged and destroyed
en route to India on a ship.

00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:26.530
He nevertheless maintained
this fundamental idea

00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:29.960
of human nature is learning.

00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:35.110
It is what Kevin Lynch
stressed as distinguishing

00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:40.000
the human being from
other animal species--

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.660
brain size and its
capacity to learn.

00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:52.780
For Geddes, the human being
was central as a humanist.

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:59.170
But he had observations
about the way in which nature

00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:04.600
we could accompany
the human learning

00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:08.740
capacity in the generation
of good systems.

00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:13.930
Participation of people is
now an accepted political

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:17.140
of creation of modern urbanism.

00:59:23.850 --> 00:59:29.230
The attempt by
some of the people

00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:32.940
we'll see in a few minutes
to coordinate and make

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:35.646
sense of the inner world
and the outer world

00:59:35.646 --> 00:59:42.000
of transcendentalists,
like Benton MacKaye

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.030
in the United States--

00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:49.320
the notion that you
can both cooperate

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:52.560
nature and the economy,
such as the Tennessee Valley

00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:58.520
Authority the new regionalism.

00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:02.310
God, can you imagine
in the United States

01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:06.270
today getting seven states
in the American South

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:08.760
to agree that the
central government would

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:12.157
make a plan for all of them?

01:00:12.157 --> 01:00:12.740
It's nonsense.

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:19.610
This capacity to
see natural regions

01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:23.720
as natural phenomena outside
of political boundaries

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.990
is Geddesian idea.

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:33.570
The greatest piece
of human intervention

01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:40.500
in our time in this country
must be the Tennessee Valley

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.850
Authority.

01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:49.690
I'll end up these profiles with
a quick look at the Tennessee

01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:51.079
Valley Authority.

01:00:55.300 --> 01:01:00.040
Ebenezer Howard was
a young Englishman

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.010
who drifted to the United
States at the age of 21

01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:06.670
because he had
uncle in Nebraska.

01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:08.125
He was a dreamer.

01:01:08.125 --> 01:01:14.740
He learned rapid
transcription in Chicago.

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:21.400
Came back to England, made a
living as a court reporter,

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:25.060
but had the idea
that new towns could

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:29.980
be the salvation of
industrial chaos.

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:33.880
He was the founder of what
is called the Garden City

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.820
movement, and he
built two towns.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:40.750
Can you imagine a man with
that economic background

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:44.260
being the sponsor of two towns?

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:47.710
Letchworth in 1905,
about 80 miles

01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:53.800
from London, and Welwyn
Garden City in 1920,

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:58.720
these were towns which
followed certain naturalistic

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.910
principles.

01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:07.360
They were meant to take what
is best of the center city,

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.550
take what is best
of the countryside,

01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:15.145
and amalgam the two in a kind of
urbanistic master mix machine.

01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:22.490
It would be identifiable
parts of this community,

01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:24.820
and so on and so on.

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:28.240
The Garden City movement
had universal appeal.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:32.140
Mumford regards it as the
most extensive influence.

01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:48.110
He says that the book
Garden Cities of To-Morrow

01:02:48.110 --> 01:02:50.480
has done more than
any other single book

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.100
to guide the modern
town planning

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:54.040
movement toward its objective.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:03:00.610
We can't pay much more
attention to this movement.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:03.730
In the United States,
we have Clarence Stein

01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:10.240
and Henry Wright's book
Towards New Towns for America.

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:15.130
The Regional Planning
Association of America in 1923

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:17.770
was a group of
architects, planners,

01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:21.070
exponents of conservation,
sociologists,

01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:27.050
and economists who came
together to make greater

01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:30.910
sense of American urbanism.

01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:34.060
They were influenced
by the British Patrick

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:39.680
Geddes, who was invited to
come and talk to them in 1923.

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:45.280
They mixed a strange
kind of religious element

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.640
of transcendentalism,
the movement

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.580
started here in
Cambridge, Massachusetts,

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:55.870
on the 8th of September
1836 by people

01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:59.445
like George Putnam, Ralph Waldo
Emerson, and Frederic Henry

01:03:59.445 --> 01:04:01.540
Hedge.

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:09.430
Nature was the vehicle which
associated the mind and nature,

01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:12.430
and not nature was [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:18.140
Combining the mind and the
body through the element

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:21.270
of nature was one of the--

01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:26.020
there was not enough to be
argued in the functional

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.400
plan of things.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:30.460
There had to be some
transcendental-- some larger,

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:32.300
ethos associated.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:35.770
And this ethos was not
in conventional theism

01:04:35.770 --> 01:04:40.750
or religion, but in an invented
religion without religion--

01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:43.045
a naturalist religion of a kind.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.790
And so we go through
Sunnyside Gardens in Radburn

01:04:48.790 --> 01:04:49.435
in New Jersey.

01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:58.090
[INAUDIBLE] another
5 or 10 minutes.

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:09.680
I'd rather spend the time on
talking about the Tennessee

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.160
Valley Authority
as a case study.

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:28.480
In 1930, the condition of
the region was as follows.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:33.130
30% of the region was
afflicted by malaria, others

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:36.580
by hookworm, pellagra,
and black lung disease.

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:41.500
The income was $639
per year per family.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:45.310
Much of the farmland had
been eroded or depleted.

01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:50.890
In Tennessee alone, 14 million
acres needed reclamation.

01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:54.700
10% of the forests were
being burnt each year,

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:57.730
and the river long
used for transportation

01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:01.270
by Native Americans had
been clogged by floods.

01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:05.260
The area covered by the--

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:10.840
over 90% of the people had
no electricity in 1930.

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:18.730
30% had no toilets, and 65%
had to walk over 250 meters

01:06:18.730 --> 01:06:19.420
to get water.

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:28.370
There are a number of
responses to this situation.

01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:34.160
The first was the
response by a group

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.990
who called themselves
the Southern

01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:42.740
Agrarians, an intellectual group
who claimed that farmers were

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:47.630
ancient pioneers of hardy
stock, capable of sustaining

01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:52.040
themselves and only
wanting to be left alone.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:55.580
Twain had eulogized the
great rivers of the South

01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:58.400
in the new language of nature.

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.860
Beaten by the North
in the Civil War,

01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:04.040
the South resisted the
invasion of their nature

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:08.090
by metropolitanization by
the [INAUDIBLE] centralized

01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:11.750
and the impersonal nature
of modernism, machines,

01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:16.700
and the central government,
which the TVA represented.

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:21.200
See, here, we have a reaction
to this kind of condition.

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.430
Leave it to us.

01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:23.870
Do not intervene.

01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:27.950
Do not bring
large-scale intervention

01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:30.020
to bear on us people.

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:34.070
We have lived through turmoil
before, and we have managed.

01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:39.460
This is an ethos
of conservation.

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:44.710
The second perspective
was that held by Roosevelt

01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:49.930
and his colleagues, who
led to the creation in 1933

01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:54.400
of an authority which had
large rights to change

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.390
this seven-state environment.

01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:02.320
Roosevelt was very
influenced in regionalism

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:05.050
by people like Benton MacKaye.

01:08:05.050 --> 01:08:11.230
Mumford strongly supported--
who met with Roosevelt before he

01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:15.640
signed the TVA proclamation.

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:23.450
The ethos, if there was one in
Roosevelt's team, was, I quote,

01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:27.760
"Multi-use use and
seamless environments,

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:33.010
trees and nature are means to
solve almost any human problem,

01:08:33.010 --> 01:08:37.330
touching every river and
creek and [INAUDIBLE] touches

01:08:37.330 --> 01:08:40.720
and gives life to all
form of human concerns."

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:45.189
If this isn't a naturalistic
view, I don't know what is.

01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:08.890
Yeah.

01:09:08.890 --> 01:09:14.680
The TVA proceeded after
'33 to develop fertilizers,

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:16.899
told farmers how
to have great crop

01:09:16.899 --> 01:09:21.700
yields and replant forests,
controlled forests.

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:27.430
Devastation floods created
an irrigation channel,

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:30.160
which carries more than
50 million tons of goods

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.870
on the Tennessee River.

01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:34.899
They built 29
hydroelectric dams,

01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:39.550
which made the TVA the nation's
largest power company, and so

01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:41.470
on.

01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:45.160
A third alternative
view of what was

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:48.279
seen as socialist
intervention was

01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:51.399
that proclaimed by Henry Ford.

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:55.150
Henry Ford in 1921 offered
Congress $5 million

01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:59.560
to buy the Wilson dam
and the power facilities

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.570
to develop his alternative
to Roosevelt's TVA.

01:10:04.570 --> 01:10:08.620
Ford soon saw nature through
the lens of agriculture,

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:11.650
which he believed had
been mistakenly ignored

01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:15.460
in the making of American
Industrial cities.

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:18.940
To create a machine-agriculture
balance that is

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:23.260
a machine-nature balance,
Ford proposed to build a city

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:26.110
in a town called Muscle Shoals--

01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:29.410
muscle in-- muscle,
like on the human body,

01:10:29.410 --> 01:10:34.660
and shoals, S- H- O- A-
L- S. 120 kilometers long

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:39.850
and 24 kilometers wide, made
of a string of small towns

01:10:39.850 --> 01:10:42.400
from which workers
commute to his factories.

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:55.740
Ford was rejected by Congress,
led by Senator Norris, who

01:10:55.740 --> 01:11:00.360
claimed this act of revitalizing
the Tennessee Valley

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.970
Authority should be
done by the public,

01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:05.310
not by the private sector.

01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:07.740
A strange thought these days.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:25.170
Since 1973, there have been
new conceptions of nature

01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:28.500
that have little to do with
the romance of tradition

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:31.920
nor with the efficiency
of relational regionalism,

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:37.560
nor the reclamation of
agriculture through industry.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:42.480
First, in 1973, the
construction of the Tellico Dam

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.940
on the Little
Tennessee was halted

01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:48.210
when a rare 9
centimeter long fish

01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:50.670
was discovered in these waters.

01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:54.600
The fish, which
was claimed to be

01:11:54.600 --> 01:12:00.210
a unique species and
a potential demise

01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:03.300
became a watershed event
in the growing American

01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:05.280
environmental movement.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.200
It was taken to the
United States Supreme

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:11.090
Court, who upheld the
environmentalists' protests.

01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:16.800
Since the controversy,
the small fish

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.300
has been relocated to another in
Tennessee, where it's thriving.

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:26.340
The snail darter
[? conservaty ?] still stands.

01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:32.100
The interesting thing
about a 9 centimeter fish--

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:35.980
it's not quite interesting
about it, I must admit.

01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:42.330
But what is interesting is that
it's within the large Tennessee

01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:46.800
Valley Authority, which we've
seen in relation to differing

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.270
views about nature.

01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:53.910
Here's a microscopic element
of nature causing an attempt

01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:55.935
to stop a dam.

01:13:01.104 --> 01:13:05.150
In the 1950s, as the
demand for electricity

01:13:05.150 --> 01:13:10.760
was outstripping the capacity
of the hydroelectric facilities,

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:14.960
the TVA began to build
coal-fired electric plants,

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:21.346
which account for about 65%
of its electricity output.

01:13:21.346 --> 01:13:24.050
Why I'm telling
you this story is

01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:27.080
to indicate for
you, in one project

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:30.740
over 70 years, the
conflicting and differing

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.650
ways in which
nature is introduced

01:13:33.650 --> 01:13:38.870
as the basis for critique
and for revision.

01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:46.730
Nobody cared about small
fish in the dams in 1933.

01:13:46.730 --> 01:13:49.310
Cultural and
technological change

01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:52.760
produced a new way
of discovering nature

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:55.130
in the water.

01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:59.270
The original idea to
generate electricity

01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:01.940
through the building
of hydroelectric

01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:07.310
turned out by 1950 not to be
producing enough electricity.

01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:14.210
So they switched to coal, which
now is the predominant energy

01:14:14.210 --> 01:14:15.950
source.

01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:20.720
On December the 22nd, 2008,
an earthen dike at one

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:27.320
of the plants at Lincoln broke,
spilling a billion gallons

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:30.620
of wet coal ash across
300 acres of land

01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:32.730
and into the tributaries.

01:14:32.730 --> 01:14:34.340
The New York Times
in the next day

01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:39.560
called it quote, "The largest
environmental disaster

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.330
of its kind in the
United States."

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:50.250
In 1943, the US government
built the Oak Ridge Laboratory

01:14:50.250 --> 01:14:53.730
in Tennessee as part of
its Manhattan Project

01:14:53.730 --> 01:14:57.420
to separate and produce
uranium 13 for use

01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:59.270
in developing a nuclear weapon.

01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:09.280
We start with a problem.

01:15:13.150 --> 01:15:16.690
We have reactions
to probably invoking

01:15:16.690 --> 01:15:19.630
the best use of nature.

01:15:19.630 --> 01:15:22.555
The idea of nature,
the level at which it

01:15:22.555 --> 01:15:27.280
had seen and discriminated
changes over time,

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.210
over 80 years, we now have a
completely different view--

01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:33.430
not a completely different view.

01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:37.030
We have a different
set of tools with which

01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:38.170
to understand nature.

01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:44.590
So it argues as
much for there not

01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:49.240
being a fixed and determinant
view of nature superseding

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.660
almost every
possible alternative

01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:56.320
view, but a fluctuating
view of nature

01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:00.000
as an important phenomenon
in human existence.

01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:08.370
This adds strength to
the idea that the city

01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:11.200
is a phenomenon of change.

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.770
And we will, in our
subsequent classes,

01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:17.490
be looking carefully at
theories which attempt

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:20.070
to accommodate these changes.

01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:30.300
How Roosevelt in 1933 could have
known about the snail darter,

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:31.870
I don't know.

01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:33.540
But I do know he
couldn't have known.

01:16:37.570 --> 01:16:41.980
This is the forward to
[? Ilya ?] [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:44.420
father's book on the city.

01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:47.580
It shows plans of London.

01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:50.890
There is no evaluation,
other than visually,

01:16:50.890 --> 01:16:51.895
it looks like cancer.

01:16:55.240 --> 01:17:00.190
That it may be performing
better in terms of social equity

01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:05.500
than under Henry
VIII is not an issue.

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:09.820
He is an architect and looks
at patterns of architecture,

01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:17.500
and derives the observation
that not only is this a more

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.920
complicated and
more complex problem

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.150
to be resolved pattern-wise.

01:17:25.150 --> 01:17:28.660
He would apply
that solution to it

01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:33.790
that is identifiable small
units, either neighborhood

01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:40.210
or idiosyncratic
environments or patterns,

01:17:40.210 --> 01:17:46.780
in a way which isn't as
fragmented and difficult

01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:48.166
as this.

01:17:48.166 --> 01:17:52.720
This is a plan for the
metropolis of tomorrow

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:57.040
by Victor Gruen, who simplified
things everywhere he could.

01:18:00.370 --> 01:18:06.550
The task is to learn how to
identify patterns in this kind

01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:10.090
of environment which are
good and which are bad,

01:18:10.090 --> 01:18:16.850
as opposed to creating
a new geometry,

01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:25.400
which for elementary reasons
cannot accept a city form,

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.750
which is on the
bottom on the left.

01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:28.250
Next.

01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:35.760
Patrick Geddes, the Scottish
biologist and town planner.

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:41.370
The Laplace diagram-- if
you follow the black lines,

01:18:41.370 --> 01:18:47.850
you follow the acts, deeds,
thoughts, facts all together.

01:18:47.850 --> 01:18:54.060
Experience and ideation,
work and synergy,

01:18:54.060 --> 01:19:02.070
all are part of segments
of thought and feeling,

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:14.060
experience emotion,
ethnopolity, synergy and so on.

01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:16.790
The whole idea is
that everything

01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:20.890
in the human experience
touches on everything else.

01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:29.870
It was a kind of vision
of a synoptic world which

01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:33.230
could make sense of
everything, but particularly

01:19:33.230 --> 01:19:36.420
in the relationship
between things.

01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:36.920
Next.

01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:42.710
So one would expect
the Hebrew University

01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:45.980
plan, which he did with
his son-in-law, who

01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:48.950
was an architect.

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:51.470
The center is a center.

01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:54.200
That is a biological constant.

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:57.620
It's fundamental.

01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:03.395
If you believe [INAUDIBLE],,
it's built into archaic man.

01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:09.890
The dome on the
building is a form

01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:15.890
which is the only architectural
form which is accepted by Jews,

01:20:15.890 --> 01:20:19.730
Islam, and Christianity.

01:20:19.730 --> 01:20:22.670
So bringing all
these things together

01:20:22.670 --> 01:20:27.440
suggests a form which
can deal with all three

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:30.350
at the same time.

01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:36.170
The ideation
context, the branches

01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:40.730
of science and the humanities,
and the various aspects

01:20:40.730 --> 01:20:44.810
of knowledge are branched
out in arms from the center

01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:48.900
in order to go from
the bottom on the left.

01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:50.330
I don't know what it is.

01:20:50.330 --> 01:20:52.610
In order to get
to the center you

01:20:52.610 --> 01:20:55.700
have to pass through
other bodies of knowledge.

01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:58.790
Again, the whole
idea is that what

01:20:58.790 --> 01:21:03.500
makes a human
environment most powerful

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:07.790
is the capacity to capture
more than one element

01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:09.170
of human experience.

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:15.830
When I talked today about
a number of social science

01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:19.550
theories of city
form, this aspect

01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:20.990
will be particularly missing.

01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:29.780
The valley section--
there is a natural place

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:33.500
for things in a system.

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.270
He's wrong.

01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:38.150
There is nothing natural
about that at all.

01:21:38.150 --> 01:21:41.120
The soil condition will
determine to some extent

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.620
the kind of--

01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:46.220
but we will see another
version of this in von Thunen's

01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:50.540
diagrams in southern
Germany in the beginning

01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:53.690
of the 19th century,
which also lays out

01:21:53.690 --> 01:21:56.450
a pattern of distribution,
but it's largely

01:21:56.450 --> 01:22:00.710
as a function of
transportation costs.

01:22:00.710 --> 01:22:04.640
Milk is produced close to
the center of the city.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.230
Further out is cream.

01:22:06.230 --> 01:22:08.180
Why?

01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:13.190
What is natural about cream
being further from the center?

01:22:13.190 --> 01:22:16.730
Cream is produced in
smaller volumes than milk.

01:22:16.730 --> 01:22:20.210
Therefore, the transportation
costs are less.

01:22:20.210 --> 01:22:24.710
It's assuming all transportation
is towards the center.

01:22:24.710 --> 01:22:31.310
Secondly, cream perishes
less rapidly than milk,

01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:37.530
so it's resistant to longer
transportation possibilities.

01:22:37.530 --> 01:22:41.600
Here, the valley
diagram just assumes

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:46.010
there's a natural
rightness of location.

01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:50.580
There is no natural
rightness of location.

01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:51.080
Next.

01:22:56.980 --> 01:23:02.740
OK, he's working in one
of the Indian towns.

01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:08.440
This is Balrampur,
and he uses items,

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:11.110
such as conservative surgery.

01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:18.070
Rather than bulldozing what
the maharajah called the slum,

01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:25.490
he looks to the possibilities
of cosmetic surgery,

01:23:25.490 --> 01:23:31.780
investing energy and
money in key items.

01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:36.160
But basically,
probably what is there

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:44.500
is considered as good in
itself, rather than the erasing.

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:50.590
The notion here is
that you cannot--

01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:55.840
by erasing a system, you retain
very little of its capacity

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.445
to introduce new items.

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:04.360
It's one of the problems
of new settlements.

01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:08.410
They don't have the built-in
connection between history

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:10.075
and memory and newness.

01:24:13.150 --> 01:24:16.960
You can see how Geddes'
mind as a biologist

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:21.640
exerts itself in
a number of items.

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:24.790
Ebenezer Howard,
on the other hand,

01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:31.240
sees the distinction between
the central city and the country

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:35.935
as the basis of making a
division between the two.

01:24:35.935 --> 01:24:36.435
Next.

01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:49.130
He postulates the town country
has low rents, high wages,

01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:50.990
plenty to do.

01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:53.720
Town is bad, country is great.

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:58.640
But country is dumb,
town is too expensive.

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.510
Town-country brings together
all the best things.

01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:09.080
No sweating, pure air and
water, cooperation, no smoke.

01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:12.290
Why should there
be more cooperation

01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:17.750
in a town-country phenomenon
than in an urban setting?

01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:21.020
You may argue that in fact,
quite the opposite is probably

01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:21.980
true.

01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:27.020
That the higher proportion
of people likely to cooperate

01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:33.020
learn to cooperate in a dense
environment than in a loosely--

01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:37.340
but that's not at
issue for Howard.

01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:40.520
Howard's a man who learned
to be a court reporter,

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:45.200
but had the practical
genius of an Englishman

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:46.980
to build new towns.

01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:47.480
Next.

01:25:50.516 --> 01:25:52.330
Here, you can see it again.

01:25:52.330 --> 01:25:57.010
Yesterday, this is Manchester
as described by Engels.

01:25:57.010 --> 01:26:01.810
Today, tomorrow, living
and working in the sun

01:26:01.810 --> 01:26:05.020
at Welwyn Garden City,
one of the two cities

01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:10.120
that Ebenezer Howard proposed.

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:18.730
The early romanticization
of suburbia,

01:26:18.730 --> 01:26:22.580
it produces nature in
a domesticated form.

01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:26.260
Here's this benign husband
and wife and little daughter

01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:29.500
sitting in a man-made garden.

01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.075
People are friendly.

01:26:31.075 --> 01:26:31.575
Next.

01:26:36.250 --> 01:26:41.980
The greatest asset--
the Garden City movement

01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:44.440
became an international
phenomenon.

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.300
It was taken up by
the Regional Planing

01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:55.435
Association of New York in
1923 as one of its great goals.

01:26:55.435 --> 01:26:58.430
Here, you can see
some of the charm.

01:26:58.430 --> 01:27:03.850
There's a lot of invention in
site planning in these towns.

01:27:03.850 --> 01:27:07.655
Let's skip and go
on to some of those.

01:27:07.655 --> 01:27:08.155
Next.

01:27:11.250 --> 01:27:17.720
The idea-- this is
Letchworth, 1905.

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:25.570
But there was also the idea
that you could break up

01:27:25.570 --> 01:27:30.190
the facade of a street,
largely straight because

01:27:30.190 --> 01:27:36.700
of a mechanical system, by
identifying opportunities

01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:43.415
or creating a different
relationship to the street.

01:27:43.415 --> 01:27:43.915
Next.

01:27:52.190 --> 01:27:58.550
You can see some of the
items of this invented idea.

01:27:58.550 --> 01:28:00.920
First of all, the cul-de-sac--

01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:07.070
traffic should not run along
its clearly identified path.

01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:08.630
It should be stopped.

01:28:08.630 --> 01:28:14.060
The cluster, the
road which bends

01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:22.050
informs the curve, the
retention of our buildings.

01:28:22.050 --> 01:28:27.020
So again, here is a combination
of the old and the new.

01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:29.630
And landscaping became
an important part

01:28:29.630 --> 01:28:33.500
of the manifestation of space.

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:35.690
Different types of
landscaping in the form

01:28:35.690 --> 01:28:38.300
of large trees, small trees.

01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:42.860
This, in my view, is
the major contribution

01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:44.970
of Garden City knowledge.

01:28:44.970 --> 01:28:45.470
Next.

01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:53.950
Here is Nuovo Quartiere
of Villini, a Garden City

01:28:53.950 --> 01:28:58.870
suburb in Milano.

01:28:58.870 --> 01:29:00.610
They occur in Cape Town.

01:29:00.610 --> 01:29:03.310
They occur all over the world.

01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:09.580
The shopping center,
again, underscaled.

01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:13.210
In relation to in
the United States,

01:29:13.210 --> 01:29:17.050
the ratio of parking
space to floor space

01:29:17.050 --> 01:29:20.500
would be phenomenally
larger than here.

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:23.710
And one of the problems
with these kinds of towns

01:29:23.710 --> 01:29:30.005
has been the increase
in car population.

01:29:30.005 --> 01:29:30.505
Next.

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:36.280
The Regional
Planning Association

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:38.170
in the United
States-- this is again

01:29:38.170 --> 01:29:42.640
a diagram of Victor
Gruen, showing

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:45.790
how unsubtle the
simultaneous relationship

01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:49.690
with Patrick Geddes spoke of.

01:29:49.690 --> 01:29:53.830
Yes, there are people who
walk and there are people

01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:56.980
who travel longer distances.

01:29:56.980 --> 01:30:04.090
That they need to be separated
by a mechanical system

01:30:04.090 --> 01:30:04.645
is stupid.

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:12.610
It involves an introduction
of a new infrastructure, which

01:30:12.610 --> 01:30:15.550
is relatively purposeless.

01:30:15.550 --> 01:30:19.060
You can take apart
all the elements.

01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:22.240
But the idea of
cleanliness, of a kind of--

01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:28.720
the Victor Gruen plan,
the Washington plan,

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:32.500
has a kind of clarity
of fundamentalism,

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:37.030
which is supposedly
attractive, whereas in fact,

01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:39.640
the cancer-like
planned of London

01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:45.970
has items in it which have a
higher degree of intelligence

01:30:45.970 --> 01:30:47.090
than this.

01:30:47.090 --> 01:30:49.420
This is a lower level
of intelligence.

01:30:53.290 --> 01:30:55.990
The organic model again.

01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:59.470
The possible state of the
future in which each part serves

01:30:59.470 --> 01:31:02.560
its logical function in
support of wholesome activity

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:03.940
and good living.

01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:06.055
Each part has its right place.

01:31:10.690 --> 01:31:14.890
Central Park, a model
of the insertion

01:31:14.890 --> 01:31:23.560
of a natural phenomenon
by Olmsted and Vaux.

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:27.010
I think it's 1859, I'm not sure.

01:31:27.010 --> 01:31:31.480
And Olmsted, the
progenitor of much the idea

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.310
of the cosmic model--

01:31:33.310 --> 01:31:37.060
sorry, organic model,
planned for Riverside

01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:39.410
just outside of Chicago.

01:31:39.410 --> 01:31:44.590
The curved surface,
no straight lines,

01:31:44.590 --> 01:31:51.350
idiosyncratic, speed at
movement through the complex.

01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.850
Next.

01:31:54.990 --> 01:31:56.640
Sunnyside Gardens.

01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:02.700
Well on the left Clarence Perry
neighborhood theory measuring

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:07.980
the safe walking distance
of a child to school

01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:13.270
is giving a density of
an appropriate walking

01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:14.700
[INAUDIBLE].

01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:18.840
And Sunnyside Gardens,
Stein and Wright's

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:24.240
complex, where you
internalize the urban world

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:36.300
into a safe environment and
treat it as a communal asset,

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:40.260
with everybody
contemplating the unity

01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:44.070
of the social circumstance
which created.

01:32:47.670 --> 01:32:55.020
Over time, each owner
started building

01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:58.230
particular private
space enclosures

01:32:58.230 --> 01:33:00.780
eating into the public space.

01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:03.810
But in recent years,
there's been an attempt

01:33:03.810 --> 01:33:10.200
to reformulate the
original open space.

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:13.165
I don't know if that's Lewis
Mumford, but he lived here.

01:33:13.165 --> 01:33:13.665
Next.

01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:23.540
Chatham Village, a number
of these layouts occurred.

01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:27.530
Chatham Village in Pittsburgh.

01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:28.595
Next.

01:33:28.595 --> 01:33:30.560
The phenomenon is the same--

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:40.640
the predominance of nature, the
separation of places to walk

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:45.230
and places to drive, the
capacity to fix things

01:33:45.230 --> 01:33:50.790
in your own property, the
kind of control of the world,

01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:56.600
and really good neighborly
relationship between houses,

01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:03.560
at least that is accepted
without somehow the community

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:10.280
is energized by the fact
that the whole system is made

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:13.880
pro-humano in some way--

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:16.730
so it is thought.

01:34:16.730 --> 01:34:23.570
A good biological system
will animate its users

01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:26.450
to believe in it.

01:34:26.450 --> 01:34:30.950
You have no way of not
believing in your body.

01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:31.880
Next.

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:35.270
That's Radburn, New
Jersey, on the left based

01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:40.250
on walking distance of children
and the externalization

01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:41.280
of automobiles.

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:41.780
Next.

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:52.320
The greenbelt towns built under
the Roosevelt administration--

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:55.590
again, the walking
distance of children,

01:34:55.590 --> 01:35:03.030
and the use of major
curved geometries

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:10.140
to enhance the fact that the
buildings and the streets

01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:18.420
are not subject to
simple mechanization.

01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:23.340
But the patterns of the
street in themselves

01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:27.030
would animate or lead
to an understanding

01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:30.590
of the natural
quality of this place.
