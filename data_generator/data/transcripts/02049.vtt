00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.410
PROFESSOR: So another important
source of convection in an air

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.180
filled room is buoyancy
due to differences

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.510
in the density of the air
as the temperature varies.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.120
Even relatively small
variations in temperature

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.960
can lead to significant flows.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.510
There's another
dimensionless number,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.290
which controls the
appearance and strength

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:45.010
of such flows, which is the
Rayleigh number, written Ra.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.150
And this is also a
physical property

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.640
of the-- it's a combination
of physical properties

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.280
of the fluid plus the geometry.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.270
So in this case, the
relevant geometrical scale

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.180
is the height, because this is
a gravitational instability.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.880
So in the Rayleigh
number, we have gravity.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:16.600
I'll just define all these--
a gravitational acceleration,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.500
which is 9.8 meters
per second squared.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.620
We have-- well, if we define
the change in air density

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.080
relative to the initial
air density that's

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.310
caused by changes
in temperature,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.060
if the temperature
changes aren't too big,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.110
there is a linear
response, which

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.240
is defined by the thermal
expansion coefficient beta, so

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.100
beta delta T.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:53.360
So beta is the thermal
expansion coefficient.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.310
And this, for air, is
something like 3.1 times 10

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.370
to the minus 3 inverse Kelvins.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.400
OK, so basically we have gravity
times the change in density.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.350
That's the buoyancy
force per volume.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.370
And so we can write that as
beta delta T. Or I should say,

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.880
delta T is T maximum
minus T minimum.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.660
So there's some
temperature change.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.250
So the example we're
going to consider

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.290
is a cold plate above a hot
plate with a fluid in between.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.750
And then we have also
some other parameters.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.660
So we have-- the length
comes in cubed now.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.310
So it's very sensitive to
the size of the system.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.250
And then we also have
the kinetic viscosity

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.370
of air, which I'll
write again here.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.350
This also appeared in
the Reynolds number.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:03:02.620
And for air, this is 1.5
times 10 to the minus 5 meters

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.180
squared per second, roughly.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.600
And then finally, we
have alpha T, which

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.580
is the thermal diffusivity.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.100
So this parameter gives a sense
of how quickly heat energy is

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.770
transmitted by conduction and
diffusion through the fluid.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.900
And thermal
diffusivity, turns out,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.370
is pretty close to the kinematic
viscosity for a gas, like air.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.070
And the reason is that
the ratio of thermal--

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.640
well, in other words, the ratio
of the kinematic viscosity

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:54.050
to the thermal diffusivity
for air is around 0.7.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.930
And this ratio, by the
way, is called Pr--

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.640
the Prandtl number--
which is also

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.590
very important in
these sorts of flows.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.330
And for gases, basically
kinematic viscosity

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.060
refers to the diffusion
and momentum in the air,

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.640
whereas the thermal
diffusivity alpha is

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.550
the diffusion of heat energy.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.120
And in a gas, both
those processes

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.690
occur by collisions
of molecules.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.450
And since it's the
same mechanism,

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.279
you have roughly the
same order of magnitude

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.520
of those quantities.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.190
So basically, all
these quantities

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.020
enter the Rayleigh number.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.080
And the way to think
about, qualitatively,

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.670
what the Rayleigh
number is telling us

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:42.180
is the ratio of buoyancy
force to viscous stress, which

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.340
is trying to fight that
motion as we talked

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:52.050
about before, but also heat
diffusion or thermal diffusion,

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.470
which is also kind
of fighting it,

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.110
because it spreads
out the temperature

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.960
gradient because this is
a motion that is naturally

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.090
driven whenever a temperature
gradient exists which

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.500
is unstable.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.670
So because this beta
is typically positive--

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.550
so when you heat the
fluid, it expands.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.400
That's certainly the
case for most gases

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.020
and even for many liquids.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.740
Then what I've sketched here is
an unstable density gradient,

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.330
where if the cold
is above the hot,

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.180
there's a heavy fluid
above a light fluid.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.500
And at conditions of
low Rayleigh number,

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.220
this is stable.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.230
And in particular, if
the Rayleigh number

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.840
is less-- for this
particular case of two fixed

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.090
plates and an infinite
layer of fluid,

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.150
if the Rayleigh number
is less than 1708,

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.880
then we have a stable situation.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.300
Or it can be at
least meta-stable.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:49.450
It won't go spontaneously
unstable, so at least local--

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.450
stable to small perturbations.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:58.170
But then at this critical
Rayleigh number of 1708,

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.350
we start to get some spontaneous
flows, because what's happening

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.940
is that the heavy
fluid above, which

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.580
I've sketched in blue--
the cold fluid-- it wants

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.360
to sink to the bottom,
whereas the red, warmer

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.220
fluid is lighter and
wants to rise to the top.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.840
And so it has to find
a way to do that.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.630
And eventually, it
breaks symmetry and just

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.830
starts forming convection.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.080
And that is so-called
natural convection.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.790
So you have plumes of hot fluid
rising and cold fluid sinking,

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.540
driven at first by
fairly regular arrays.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.010
But as you increase the
Rayleigh number even further,

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.560
and if you increase it a
lot, then you eventually

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.700
get to a complicated
turbulent flow.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.290
So if you increase the Rayleigh
number on the order of 10

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.840
to the 4, you may have
some unsteady situations

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.150
as we saw with the
vortex shedding.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.520
But here, if you go to a
very high Reynolds number--

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.290
Rayleigh number, I should say--

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:55.860
greater than about 10 to the 9,
then you again get turbulence.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.090
So simply these temperature
variations are strong enough--

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.010
those buoyancy forces--
to completely destabilize

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.340
the fluid and generate
a turbulent mixture

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.370
where the hot and cold
are very quickly mixing.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.000
And I've sketched
here the hot and cold

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.060
as still being separate.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.200
But in fact, due to diffusion,
they will kind of also

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.720
be re-equilibrating
all the time as well,

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.700
although the temperature
gradient is needed

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.820
to kind of maintain that flow.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.340
So let's see how big
the Rayleigh number

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.030
is in different situations of
interest for indoor air now,

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.700
as well.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.540
So if we look, let's
say, in a room--

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.670
so let's have-- this
is another room.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:43.980
And let's imagine again, we have
our heating and ventilation air

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.530
conditioning.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.190
Let's say, it's an
air conditioning unit

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.990
on the top, which is
dumping in some cold air.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.760
And it's giving
it some velocity.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.659
So the velocity is associated
with the Reynolds number.

00:07:55.659 --> 00:08:00.220
That inertia will lead to
destabilization and vortices

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.790
and mixing by itself.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.880
But let's see what the effect is
of the temperature difference,

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.380
OK?

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.540
So we're injecting cold air.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.590
And we usually put it on
top, because we actually

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:09.880
want good mixing in the room.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.460
That's how these
systems are designed.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.590
We also inject heat normally
from below, for example,

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:18.520
from the lower sections of
the wall or from the floor.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.430
And so if we were-- and in
fact, I could just mention,

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.290
if we were to heat,
we would do that.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.450
And if we're doing air
conditioning or cooling,

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:29.960
we would do it from above.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.730
And so basically, there is an
unstable gradient like this.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.600
And let's actually put
some numbers in here.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.260
So what if we say that
the temperature difference

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.539
between the fluid we're
injecting, whether it's

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:44.020
heating or cooling, relative
to the sort of background

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.600
air in the room, which
is, let's say, closer

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.790
to the target temperature--

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.710
is approaching target
temperature-- let's say,

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.990
it's only 10 degrees
C. So that seems

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.790
like not a very big difference.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.830
But then we go
back to our height,

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.440
which is our length scale.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.240
And we say it's 2.7 meters, just
as sort of a standard ceiling

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.500
height.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.850
If you plug in the properties
of air with these numbers,

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:14.590
the Rayleigh number is
actually 10 to the 10.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.450
It's enormous.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.390
So that tells you that if you--

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.730
and that's partly because of
the huge scale here, right?

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.020
So H comes in cubed.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.680
So if you have 2 or 3 meters of
height, that's a lot of height.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.990
And so if you are maintaining
that kind of temperature

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.670
difference across
such a height, you're

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.700
going to be generating
very serious convection

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.370
in that system.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.710
So what's happening is that
besides the fact that you're

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.650
blowing and generating
flows by inertia,

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:43.380
you also have these
thermal flows going on,

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:48.000
which can be very,
very strong in a system

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.400
when there's even just a
few degrees of temperature

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.990
difference.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.840
You've probably
seen dust in the air

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.460
near a sunny
window, which allows

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.560
you to visualize the flow.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.110
And even if nobody's
moving-- the air

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.200
is fairly still--
you might see plumes

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.940
of rising air in one location
or sinking in another air.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.490
And if you look
closely, those plumes

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:10.890
may actually have very complex
convective instabilities

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:15.150
and turbulence even, even when
the temperature differences are

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.320
not so great.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.100
And in fact, we can
see such things.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.300
For example, if we have,
let's say, a window--

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:26.880
and let's say that
it's cold outside.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.680
And it's warm inside.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.480
Then just simply that
temperature gradient

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.210
means that there's a colder
air near the surface that

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.770
wants to sink.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.500
And so the flow rate
is going to look--

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.860
or the flow is going to look
something like a boundary layer

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.730
flow of fluid that is sort
of falling near the surface.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.910
And if the Reynolds
number gets high enough,

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.270
this flow can actually
become itself unstable

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.050
as it kind of goes
down the surface.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.010
So you can see that
these rising or falling

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.360
plumes of natural convection
near vertical services

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.090
that are heated or cooled
relative to the environment

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.650
can also lead to complex flows.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.700
And actually, a
good example of that

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.850
is the flow that
occurs around a person

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.650
just simply due to
the temperature.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:18.860
So if you look very
closely at a person--

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.530
I'm not going to draw
it very well here.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.710
But let's just say,
we have a person.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.340
And that's supposed
to be a head, OK?

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.650
If you look very
closely, the body

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.540
has a temperature
which is usually higher

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.800
than the ambient by at least
10 degrees if not more.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.920
And if you now plug in a little
bit smaller size-- let's say,

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.270
we plug in 30 or 40 centimeters.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.840
And we-- so let's
do that actually.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.100
So if we say that here, maybe,
H would be on the order of--

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.010
well, since this was 3 meters,
we'll go down to 0.3 meters.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:12:00.000
So we'll drop the size
roughly by a factor of 10.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.200
But it comes in cubed .

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.040
So that drops the Rayleigh
number by a factor of 1,000.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.360
So if we still keep our
delta T at 10 degrees--

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.430
and it might actually
be much more than that--

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.670
the Rayleigh number
around this person's head,

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:16.740
just simply by virtue of the
heat generated by the body,

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.220
can be of order 10 to the 7.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.610
So it may not be quite
into the turbulent regime.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.560
But it's certainly in
the regime where there'll

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.260
be some unsteady
complicated flows due only

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.200
to natural convection.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.410
And we're not even talking
about the person moving,

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:31.030
which gives you even more flow.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.370
And so what it actually looks
like if you look closely--

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.220
the air around a
person is actually

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:41.090
rising almost like a chimney,
driven by these thermal flows.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.970
And those flows even can go
turbulent or at least generate

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.670
some vortical structures.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:48.320
And of course,
these kinds of flows

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.490
are just due to temperature.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.350
In all these cases
due to the HVAC

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:52.730
and also due to
the person, there

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.560
are these convective
flows that we've

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.590
talked about from inertia,
which also contribute to mixing.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.050
So as we'll talk
about shortly, we also

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.940
know that this
person is breathing.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.070
Let's say, they're just
breathing through the nose,

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:04.570
even.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:10.170
Then there's some puffs
that are generated.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.920
And you've got the
thermal stuff going on.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.210
Also, the air that
you're breathing out

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.410
is warmer than the ambient.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:19.170
So it tends to want
to rise as well.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:23.180
So I hope I've convinced
you here that--

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:28.540
I'll write this as, these could
be buoyant respiratory jets

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.040
and puffs.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.360
So I guess the first
part of this section

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.090
is just to convince you that
the conditions in a room

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.610
are such that we
have good reason

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:44.030
to believe that there is
significant mixing of the air,

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.610
either due to inertial
effects from movement,

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:51.860
from ventilation air flows,
or from thermal effects,

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.410
as we have sketched here.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.160
And so at least, that
gives us a beginning

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.490
of a justification
for our assumption

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.170
of a well-mixed room.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:05.850
So in this video from Linden's
group at the University

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:10.590
of Cambridge, we can see a
visualization of the airflow

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:15.090
around a person who is
speaking or just breathing.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.940
And the videos are taken
by a differential synthetic

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.730
schlieren imaging
method, which allows

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:25.890
you to see basically the
changes in density in the flow.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.830
And what we see are
these thermal plumes

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:33.480
of warm air rising past the
body due to the difference

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.390
in the body temperature and
the ambient air temperature.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.780
And we also see, on top
of that, repeated puffs

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.960
coming from the breathing,
which interact with those plumes

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:48.850
and also themselves have buoyant
and turbulent flows therein.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:52.280
In the next video, we see
how different the flows

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.050
are when masks are worn.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:57.830
So we can still see the thermal
body plume rising vertically

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.480
past the person's face.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.060
But now the mask is preventing
the transfer of momentum

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.550
to the fluid to push
forward these puffs.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.920
And instead, we see
the leaking of some

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.450
of the breathed, exhaled
air rising, almost

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:15.620
entrained in the turbulent
thermal plume rising upwards

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.970
rather than being
ejected forward.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:21.950
And so this helps to eliminate
short-range transmission

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.470
due to those puffs and
really brings us closer

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:29.840
to an airborne model
of a well-mixed room.
