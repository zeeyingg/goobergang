JULIAN BEINART: OK,
we need to talk.

00:00:31.768 --> 00:00:33.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] sorry.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.620
JULIAN BEINART: No,
no, don't be sorry.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.723
I'm sorry I have to talk.

00:00:37.723 --> 00:00:39.988
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.740
We've been going for 20--

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.736
I think this is the 21st class.

00:00:47.736 --> 00:00:51.610
We have 26 altogether.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.220
I'm going to combine
two classes today

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.710
simply, because I want to leave
some more time at the end.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.240
We run out of time
at the end, and I'm

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.680
going to try to do this
heroic task of combining

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.740
two classes into one.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.065
OK, have you got this handout?

00:01:11.065 --> 00:01:12.805
It deals with two topics.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:26.350
First of all, let me
set the framework.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.600
I argued that modernism was
an existential preoccupation

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.420
with the present, given that
the present was sufficiently

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:46.810
rich and exploratory and
creative, and absolutely devoid

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.670
of the past.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.240
He didn't speculate
much about the future,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.650
arguing that if you take care
of your existence at the moment,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.720
particularly if you are on
the verge of a new world,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.540
prediction was not necessary.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.630
Curiously enough, the
past was not necessarily

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.500
intellectually either.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.500
This is just not because
of the absence of culture.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.670
This is largely a
European movement

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.120
to which people have been
thinking and philosophizing

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.130
about architecture and urbanism
for thousands of years.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:39.350
So the hermetic phenomenon of
modernism led me to explore,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:46.490
in last week's lecture,
in the postmodern version

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:54.200
of trying to use
devices such as geometry

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.600
to enhance the future
change, accepting

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.660
that the future implies change.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.860
It's difficult to precisely
be clear about to the extent

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.520
that stochastic methods
enable one to know something

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.315
about the future.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.910
Together with that
was a preoccupation

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.390
with the immensely larger
notion of the present,

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.730
much more interested
in the complexity

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.910
of the understanding
of the present

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.080
than modernism thought of.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.090
For Corbusier, the
relegation of the plane

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.320
of buildings in the
city to greenspace

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.840
didn't ask a question about
the institutional framework

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.920
for creating or
maintaining such a system.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.800
There were no questions
about what security

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.250
would be like in a
green plane of a city

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.230
with no local monitoring.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.670
Modernism was [? pre-crime, ?]
pre the maleability of social

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.990
institutions to allow people
to take part in decisions

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.870
in a democracy.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:35.220
It was apolitical, so Corbusier
could shift his correct plan

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:44.800
from corporate capitalism
to colonial Algiers

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.540
to syndicalist Moscow, making
plans for each of these,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.990
given the geometric
formations would be absolute.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.920
What I want to try to do
today to deal with the past.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.170
If we are now blessed with axes
both forward and backwards,

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:14.820
we have a much richer and
even more difficult to

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.910
deal with urban existence.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:28.990
And we try to make the world
of the past more complex.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.420
It divides itself into
two systems of knowledge--

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.730
history and memory.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.160
I'll spend a bit
of time with each,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.240
and try to give you some
accounting of the difference

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.550
between history and memory, and
spend a lot more time on memory

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.420
than on history.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.810
The first page of
the handout deals

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:07.330
with the list of 10 different
attitudes and practices

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.400
regarding the past.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.670
You can add number 11,
which I haven't, which

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:22.585
I've since added, which deals
with remembering at a distance.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.850
This phenomenon of
remembering at a distance

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.860
has become much more
available to us.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.090
It was available to
the Jews in 70 AD when

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:48.380
they left the last temple
and went into the diaspora,

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.960
but remembered Jerusalem in
their prayers every Passover,

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.910
even today, returning
to Jerusalem

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.440
being part of the mantra.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.630
Remembering at a
distance is also

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.430
possible in the interpretation
of Christianity, which I gave,

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:20.340
when Jesus in the forequarter
of the second Jewish temple

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:25.530
says the temple will be
destroyed in a number of years.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.890
He says to his
disciples, remember

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:35.370
that my body will be your
temple, referring in some ways

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:41.250
to the canonical version
of Christianity which

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:48.330
interprets Christ's body in the
mass through blood and bread.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:54.626
Still today, it's remembering
at a distance [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.020
So given that we
have an increase

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.430
in the diasporas of the
world through migration,

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.760
we just had an incident
this month in Boston,

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:17.720
which deals with the
phenomenologically difficult

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.050
notion of interpreting
allegiance

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.640
through after migration.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:31.180
This is a contemporary
problem, and it

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:40.450
makes urbanism very
much more difficult,

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.850
given conventional
notions of allegiance

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:49.890
to city, to state, to nation.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.030
I had a thesis two years
ago, done by a Korean woman

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:59.220
from Los Angeles, who analyzed
the-- do you know the thesis.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.530
AUDIENCE: You told me about it.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:01.050
JULIAN BEINART: Oh, did I?

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:01.740
I'm sorry.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.520
We analyzed the status
of immigrant groups

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.660
in Los Angeles, where I think
one third of the population

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:19.710
are non-American, or in the
process of becoming American.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:24.810
For them, there
was no city center

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.560
to give allegiance to as in
the traditional spatial form

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.300
of the city.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.830
So she took upon herself
to utilize the emerging

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.620
underground public
transportation

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.240
system as a dispersed
form of identity

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:50.670
for a migrated population, who
are generally poorer, anyway.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.770
I don't want to get on to that.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:58.900
Let me tell you the sequence
of what we're going to do.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.440
And we go briefly
through this list,

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.710
give you some
indications of examples,

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:15.880
and then going to
go to number 6--

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.520
no, number 8 and 9
to analyze briefly

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.200
the ideas of two urban
theorists of recent time, Aldo

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.270
Rossi, the Italian who won
the Prtizker Prize stupidly.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:37.960
He wasn't stupid, but the
Pritzker committee was stupid.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.490
He's a man who wrote a very
good book called Architecture

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:46.560
of the City as a theorist
who taught it in Switzerland,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:52.230
but his buildings are
sacrilegiously bad

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.600
and very few.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.760
And seeing the
Pritzker prizes still

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:03.540
reward people not for theory,
but for practice, it's a shame.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:09.240
This shows how misguided
architectural criticism is.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.580
And the other is
Leon Krier, whom

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.960
I've chosen as an arch
example of classicism

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.020
as a method of dealing
with the present

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.520
through the lens of the past.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.680
For the rest, I will
choose examples and slide

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.800
which indicate examples
from all of this list.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.320
Let me just go through
the list very briefly.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.220
You can reshape as before.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.070
The ghetto in Warsaw
was built much

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.680
like the version
of the ghetto which

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:56.340
the Jews revolted in at the
end of the '39, '45 war.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:00.210
So for parts of Bologna--

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:02.850
you can build anew.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:08.070
One of the best examples
is the rebuilding

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.860
of the center of
Rotterdam, and I there's

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:18.720
an illustration of
both in the text.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.840
Number 3, make an open
system to allow memory

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.510
to be achieved over time.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:29.130
This is the example of the
Free University in Berlin.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:33.630
We don't do anything
to mark the past.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.760
We leave it open to
the community who

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:41.800
lives there to create their own
monuments, their own memories,

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:46.260
their own museums, their own
patterns, their own geometries.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.190
If of the past, good enough.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:53.610
If not of the past,
but existentially only

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.440
of the present, good enough.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:07.320
There is a early
electronic website.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:12.120
[INAUDIBLE] was in my class,
in an advanced version

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.790
of this class, when
he was a student here

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.500
doing his doctorate.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.370
He unearthed an
electronic program

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.680
which people could join.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.660
There was a site somewhere,
nowhere, electronically,

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.890
and people could occupy
space systematically

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:37.050
in this virtual space.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.990
After a time, the
historical society

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:43.230
grew up in this virtual space.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:48.960
I imagine the need to program
your life in sequence.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:57.700
Freud said something-- well,
I'll quote Freud in a minute.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.460
Let's rather stick
to my program.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:06.070
So easy to jump
from one to another.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.380
And before, leave
all your fragments,

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.400
but add a new program.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:18.120
This plays on the duality
of meaning between a remnant

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.710
of the past and the present.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.620
Church Court is a good example.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.700
Church Court has dual
meaning, or at least

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.800
pertains to a dual meaning.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.230
You know what Church Court is.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.830
This is just the building
just across the bridge

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:38.910
on Beacon Street.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.190
The fragments of the
church are maintained,

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.250
and a new apartment
building is added to it.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:55.450
Freud said something
extraordinary.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.360
I can't find the quotation here.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:04.570
But Freud says that it is
impossible to represent

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:10.450
the same content pictorially
in the same image.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.360
If you want to share how
Rome has grown over time,

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.440
you have to
juxtapose situations.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:24.150
You cannot spatially have a
unique meaning which has both

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.000
ingredients in it
according to Freud.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.050
Therefore, it says, to
represent mental processes

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:34.890
through pictorially
image is a waste of time,

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:39.870
for it is implying that
in our mental mechanism

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:43.590
we are able to
simultaneously think

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:49.020
of our mother and our
girlfriend simultaneously.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:54.950
But we cannot depict spatial
contexts simultaneously.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:16:00.600
Now, juxtaposing the two
formal elements of Church Court

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.370
is a method.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:06.840
A Freudian-- not Freudian,
it's a pretty pedantic method

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.040
of getting meaning from
the past and associating

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.450
with meaning with the present.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.820
There was a church here.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.350
That is a memory function.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.350
There is now a building now.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.310
This is modern.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:22.850
There's no memory
yet attached to it.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:28.560
So in the space-time continuum,
you're representing meanings

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.630
at different times.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:34.590
You are also marking
urbanisticlly the fact

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.710
that on that corner,
there was a church,

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.600
and there was a
community of people

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.130
who worshipped in the
Back Bay prior to them

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.650
immigrating, and leaving
the need for the Back Bay

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:51.540
to produce only fewer churches.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.600
You can play around with this
game as long as you want to.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.360
I'll give you a
number of examples

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.410
of the obscurity of this game.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:07.500
And architects at times, like
Peter Eisenman and others,

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.760
have played around.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:14.000
In fact the Freudian quote
comes from Peter Eisenman's

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.069
introduction to
the Rossi's book.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:26.040
Number 5, you can connect
to past urban traces,

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.440
mostly invisible.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.360
I will show you a
couple of examples,

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:38.070
one of the Peter Eisenman
studio at Harvard using memory

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:45.000
to obscure memory traces
from the Midwestern town,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.030
and also from the Bicocca
Pirelli Competition in Milan

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:54.960
and number of years ago, which
all the world's architects took

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.920
part in.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.650
I will show you the second prize
entry by the firm from Torino

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:06.360
called Gabetti and
Isola, who tried

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:11.910
to use traces of
agrarian Roman fields

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:19.070
in their ecologically
advanced project.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:28.920
The trouble with obscure traces
is that they're not present.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:34.580
Who in the hell can recount a
past history without reference

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.080
to it?

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:44.700
We did a studio in Taipei
looking at the city center.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.970
The city center was based
on an old Chinese plan.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:54.680
The Japanese came along
and changed the orientation

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.590
of the original plan.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:02.720
Some of our students
tried to show this fact.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.730
But how do you show two
geometries at the same time?

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:13.400
You can overlay one on another,
but it's difficult to explain.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:21.630
But it's not a common,
but a real option.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:28.290
Number 6, create new tectonics
based on memory forms.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:31.710
The explicit example of
that is the Holocaust Museum

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:32.920
in Washington.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:38.150
Anybody been to the
Holocaust museum?

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.920
Four people.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.850
I'll quote James Ingo Freed,
the architect who designed it,

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:49.700
and his references to using
forms borrowed from Auschwtiz--

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.720
Arbeit macht frei.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:20:02.480
And we can judge the quality
of the present experience,

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.980
whose aim is to
teach us to remember

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.100
the events of the past.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:15.440
We have a whole panoply of
items, which we use spatially

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.270
to remember the past--

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:22.220
museums, memorials,
monuments, amongst others.

00:20:24.968 --> 00:20:27.470
I haven't got time
in this class to go

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.290
into the theory of
monuments, but we'll

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:31.802
talk a bit about them.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:42.050
Number 7, build monuments,
memorials, museums.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:44.120
Here we have a conflict.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.220
Robert Musil, the
French philosopher,

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:50.780
said there is nothing as
invisible as a monument, which

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:55.610
means that the monument
is made psychologically

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.755
current or non-existent by time.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:03.990
Which kid who goes
to Washington,

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.870
and is not told that that's
the Washington Monument,

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.840
knows that it's the
Washington Monument?

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.640
Who even knows who
Washington was?

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:19.836
Washington's a famous enough
person to be remembered.

00:21:19.836 --> 00:21:23.420
But there's is a town
in Russia, a small town,

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:28.280
named after Engels, and
one named after Marx.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.760
And they just they are
undistinguished and not even

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.390
on anybody's map.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:37.460
It's not that Marx
is not remembered,

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.210
but the physical manifestation
of him in a monument to him

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:42.380
is neglected.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.140
I'll look very briefly--

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.440
although I haven't
got the slides

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:59.420
to show you because of
time, of a new device

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:05.960
to take care of the lack
of presence of monuments.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:11.510
I advised the United
States Air Force

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.690
on the selection of
a site in Washington.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:18.980
The United States Air Force
wished to follow the Navy.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.960
The Navy have-- do you
know the Navy side?

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:29.740
It's opposite the-- it's a
developer project in downtown,

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:36.370
which has a semicircular plain,
piazza, on which stands a Navy

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:39.430
soldier and a map of the world.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:43.540
But in order to go
into the museum,

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.440
you have to go into
a developer building.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.230
And there's a computer
program on which you

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:53.500
can show your grandchild
a picture of yourself

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:59.950
in the Navy in 1927,
or whatever it is.

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:02.480
Our clients, the United
States Air Force,

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.410
wished to follow the
same tradition of having

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:06.750
two items in a museum.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:12.010
One is a symbolic fixed
item, and secondly

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.340
an updatable present.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.790
The first design
by architect who

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:21.340
happened to be the same
architect as the Holocaust

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:26.560
museum, Jim Freed, had a plane
with the basement underneath.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.160
And the basement had all
of the updating mechanisms.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:36.130
So you could go, but above
it was a huge symbolic item.

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:42.220
In fact, the memorial was
never built on that site,

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:48.410
because the Marines argued that
we were too close to the Iwo

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:54.130
Jima Memorial, which is a
literal evacuation of soldiers

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:57.440
fighting on an
island in the Orient.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.980
Anyway, I'm getting
carried away.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.300
Let's stick to this program.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.840
Number 8 and number 9--

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:15.190
number 8 is what I would refer
to in the work of Leon Krier.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:22.240
That is the establishment
of European classicism

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:28.060
as a universal past
independent of time, economy,

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:34.630
and culture, and therefore
the DNA of the past.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.520
And therefore, when you work
with the DNA of the past,

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.730
whether it be New Delhi or
in Richmond Terrace in London

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.610
on the river, you are
doing greater things.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:52.660
And we'll examine Poundbury,
the town that Leon Krier advised

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.580
Prince Charles on.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.310
Prince Charles is
very much involved

00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:03.910
in the same classicism
versus modernism argument,

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:08.440
arguing that London's
been defaced by modernism.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:14.960
And here, although I won't
go into it in detail,

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:20.050
we can add the phenomenon of
new urbanism to this category.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:29.815
To use classical
form is a choice.

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.630
It's a stupid choice,
but it's a choice.

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:45.960
You can't blame people for
disliking modernism when it

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.670
appeared, and for a long time.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:59.480
And so include them
in your client group

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.850
as active participants
in your design.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:14.775
To use nostalgia as reminiscent
of a lost past is silly.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:21.020
The new urbanism doesn't deal
with contemporary issues--

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:27.390
social equity, overuse of
automobile transportation,

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:29.330
et cetera, et cetera.

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:34.460
Diversity of population
in the metropolitan areas

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:39.990
is a diverse new
urban phenomenon.

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:44.000
It recreates
nostalgic pasts which

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.900
satisfies one much like candy
satisfies a child before he

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:55.010
grows up and nourishes himself
to believe the candy is not

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:56.395
good for your body.

00:26:56.395 --> 00:26:58.420
You need to eat decent food.

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:06.500
Number 9, we can use
Aldo Rossi's argument

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:12.470
that the city has autonomous
basic forms and places which

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:16.250
perpetuate themselves--
the idea the locus, which

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:20.540
I will discuss in a minute.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.640
Number 10, let context make
the proper associations.

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:34.160
This is a very appropriate form
taught in architecture schools.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.300
Rossi argues
absolutely against it.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.390
He says that
buildings make places,

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:43.860
and places don't make buildings,
and it's foolish for a building

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.490
to be made up of
adaptations of what

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.740
people have done in the past.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:53.430
It's a strange kind of
notion, but there's a politics

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:58.600
associated with context.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:05.310
For instance, the
expanding Spaniards

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:11.490
destroyed Cusco to a plane
and rebuilt it from scratch.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:23.430
They didn't destroy the
Alhambra in post-Islam Spain.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:29.580
How is it that the Crusaders
didn't destroy the Dome

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.680
of the Rock or the
Al-Asqa mosque--

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.180
simply put a flag on it?

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.210
Historians have argued that
[INAUDIBLE] be out of respect

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.910
for the quality of
the architecture.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.420
Now, this assumes a
conquering program having

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:50.280
a DNA which includes respect.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:57.610
AUDIENCE: It also assumes
that [INAUDIBLE] culture

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:58.608
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.060
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah, it
regards colonial cultures,

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:11.480
as the British [INAUDIBLE]
regarded Indian architecture as

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.990
pathetic, as childish,
as still to be achieved.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.830
It's a little remarkable,
given the history of Islam

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:26.990
and the European
center that they

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.830
would regard Islamic
architecture quite

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:34.550
as automatically as they did.

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:37.190
Maybe they were worn
out in the [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:41.060
They took a hell of a long
time to get rid of Islam.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:48.080
They spent all
generations of resources,

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.430
and then remembering
it at distance.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.860
The other example of number
6, other than the Holocaust

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:02.090
Museum, which comes to mind is
the building you might know.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:10.700
In Verona is Carlos
Scarpa's Castelvecchio, one

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.070
of the finest, if
not the finest,

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:16.580
example of preservation
architecture

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:20.630
I think in modern times
or in recent times.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:23.690
Castelvecchio, which I won't
illustrate-- because I had

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:26.240
to choose the number of slide.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.810
I'll try not to share
more than 30 slides--

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:32.110
60 slides per class.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.370
And it's very difficult at time.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:44.480
Castelvecchio was the
home of a royal family--

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.990
Scaligeri, I think they were.

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:51.650
In 1925, it was
made into a museum.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:57.440
In 1956, Carlos Scarpa was
asked to integrate the two.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:01.850
And he took the
forms of the past

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:06.290
and introduced them
to the new building

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:14.330
in a way which I think Jim Freed
did in the Holocaust Museum.

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:20.750
But this is difficult work,
and there are not many.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:23.190
I'm sure you can think
of examples as well.

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.100
But these are the
two that come to mind

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.740
when I think of this category.

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:35.375
Let's go to Aldo Rossi briefly,
and then to Leon Krier briefly.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.640
Rossi uses the past as
a tool for understanding

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.910
the present form of the city.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:53.340
For Rossi, past is a continuum
of which we are still a part.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:59.370
The past is perpetuated almost
fossilized in the city form,

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:04.050
even as that form and its
use are constantly changing.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:06.140
Primary elements
of the city form

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:10.860
are perpetuated, through
time creating an autonomous

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.440
system of basic
absolute forms around

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:18.740
which the city has been,
and continues to be, built.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.160
It's my abstraction.

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:26.860
Let's look at a couple
of things that he argues.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.870
He argues that
there is a dialectic

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:32.620
between the city as
stones and mortar,

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:38.470
the actual physical artifact,
and the city of our minds--

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:41.170
an ideal city that
embodies experiences,

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:47.650
meaning, and understanding that
is autonomous of time and use.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:54.220
Rossi doesn't discuss
memory very much,

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.740
but what he's talking
about are much more

00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:02.620
the attributes of memory than
the attributes of history.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:06.430
He refers in his
book to the work

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:10.810
of Maurice Halbwachs, the
French sociologist who

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:13.900
wrote a book called The
Collective Memory, which

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:19.570
I think is one of the
great books of our time.

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:24.505
And I will refer to
excerpts a bit later.

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:32.460
Rossi secondly divides
the city timewise

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.760
into primary elements
and dwellings.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:39.870
When dwellings are expressions
of ever-changing individual

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:44.720
will, they constitute the
vernacular architecture

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:51.720
that is subject to changes
in use, form, and meaning.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.820
In contrast,
primary elements are

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:58.170
expressions of collective
will, especially

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:00.460
the subgroup of monuments.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.370
So housing is temporary.

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:13.050
A neighborhood may be
permanent as a primary element.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.460
I quote from him.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.654
"A monument's
persistence or permanence

00:34:16.654 --> 00:34:19.659
is a result of its
capacity to constitute

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:25.440
the city, its history, and
art, its being and memory."

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:32.760
I've given you a copy
of his project in Padua,

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:39.880
the Palazzo della
Ragione, which was,

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.690
he argues, an example
of a monument--

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:47.429
these pages here.

00:34:55.659 --> 00:35:11.410
He goes on to use the term locus
to specify a particular space

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:13.990
or place in the
city, which forms

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:16.990
a part of its permanent history.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:19.420
And his argument is
the city needs to be

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:23.140
built on these permanences.

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:27.400
All new permanences should
be created at the same time

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:36.440
as maintaining fluidity in
the dispensing of housing.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:50.420
He makes the bold statement
that permanence in form

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:53.930
precedes permanence
in institutions.

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:57.680
I quote, "The permanence
of a form or its value

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:01.140
as a reference is entirely
independent on both

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:04.520
the specific functions
for which it was designed,

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.700
and its [INAUDIBLE]
with a continuity

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.680
of urban institutions.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.800
For this reason I'm
deliberately emphasizing

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.160
the form and the architecture
of the city, rather than

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.010
its institutions."

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:24.710
I mean, primitively, he's
saying that an old building can

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:28.130
take a different
use without changing

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:30.840
its form significantly.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.150
In fact, in the
history-memory distinction,

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:39.830
he controverts the normal
history-memory relationship

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:41.180
over time.

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:45.500
Normally, somebody like
David Lowenthal in the book

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.680
The Past Is a Foreign
Country-- one of the best

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:54.760
books on architecture
preservation, by the way,

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:58.960
says that typically,
memory is short-lived,

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:02.770
and it's replaced by the
permanence of history.

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:05.020
Rossi reverts the two.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:09.220
He says history occurs as
long as a building maintains

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:10.870
its present use.

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:16.300
Memory occurs, is instituted
once the use changes.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:21.040
These are abstract ideas.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:26.170
I don't know how much empirical
evidence there is for this,

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:30.730
or how much Rossi has measured
the permanence of institutions

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:33.880
as opposed to the
permanence of monuments.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.550
It doesn't matter.

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:44.960
Rossi is valuable because
he attracts attention

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:50.090
to the distinction in value
of certain forms of the city.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.230
I had an argument
with Kevin Lynch

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:59.770
about Aldo Rossi saying
this, and I'll just

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:05.650
quote Lynch from his own writing
about his antagonism to Rossi.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.300
You can make up your own mind.

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:15.370
"For Rossi, architecture is an
autonomous discipline, eternal,

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:19.090
outside of time,
creating form typologies

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:24.380
which have an independent
existence like Platonic cities.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.260
The city is a
permanent structure

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:32.800
through which it remembers
its past, it realizes itself.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:41.500
These attitudes unfold into
monstrous, seductive flowers.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.810
They are rooted in
the same false idea

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:46.210
that man and his
habitat are completely

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.330
separate entities,
linked only, if at all,

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:54.530
by some mechanical
one-directional causation."

00:38:54.530 --> 00:39:01.990
It's true that Rossi says in his
writing that form has meaning.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:03.820
Form creates certain things.

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:15.420
I'm using [INAUDIBLE]
remembers its past.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:19.170
I think I have to give Rossi the
benefit of not being so dumb as

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:23.640
to believe that
bricks have a brain,

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.170
or stone remembers anything.

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:31.500
He's doing a syllogistic jump.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.140
I think syllogistic
is the right word.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:37.890
He's assuming that you assume.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:42.360
That it's the mental
interpretation of what--

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:49.840
when Louis Kahn says, and
as he often used to say,

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.145
something makes itself.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:59.230
He's not referring to
the mechanical system

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.430
which produces light.

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:04.030
He's referring to the
human understanding

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:07.240
of the mechanical system
which produces light.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.050
He's compressing the idea.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.920
So I think Kevin is
wrong, and I told him so.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.650
But he didn't agree with me.

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:16.900
Poor man, he's not alive
any longer to fight.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:24.310
I think you have to
read Rossi now, and make

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:29.410
an independent decision of
how much that book means.

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:33.040
I don't think you need to
look at his other books

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.970
or to biography of an idea.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:40.720
Certainly, don't look
at any of his projects,

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.880
or go to one of them
immediately and be

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:48.820
appalled by the stupidity
of the thinking.

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:56.380
Leon Krier is a much more
indomitable character.

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:59.350
He automatically classifies.

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:03.820
He makes absolute judgments.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:08.320
For him, classical architecture
is the only architecture

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:13.570
that one should contemplate
independent of economy, time,

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:16.510
culture, et cetera--

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:17.470
technology.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:27.220
He also assumes that
equally stark judgments

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.800
can be made between
public buildings

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.990
and private buildings.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:37.120
For me, the genius of much
of the complexity of urbanism

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:43.180
is the overlapping between
public and private entities

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.470
in space.

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:49.720
If I drove down Memorial
Drive and got to Mount Auburn

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.210
Hospital and looked at
the school across the way,

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:54.970
which my children went to--

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:58.580
I had to pay an anomalous
amount of money to that school.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.630
So therefore, it must
be a private school.

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:05.780
But it looks like any
school down there.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:09.190
If I go down Mount Auburn Street
and come through Watertown,

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:13.870
there's a classical
facade facing me which

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:16.180
happens to be a public school.

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:19.150
In England, a public
is a private school.

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:22.320
In American, a public
school is a public school.

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:28.330
What classifications--
I will deal

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.580
with the dichotomy
or the dialectic

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:36.295
between public and private in
city form in Thursday's class.

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:46.340
Krier can be criticized
on many levels.

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:52.230
First of all, the
universality of classicism

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:56.470
is a political assumption.

00:42:56.470 --> 00:43:02.670
I don't know if Indians and
Gandhi assume classicism

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:06.560
to be a universal form.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.170
Certainly, I never grew up
in South Africa regarding

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:13.560
classicism as the
appropriate form

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.705
to satisfy Black
ambitions in South Africa.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:24.080
Classicism was always the
form of superior buildings.

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:28.040
When I went to the low courts,
it had a classical pediment.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:33.380
When I went to visit a
political friend of mine

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:37.920
in Johannesburg's
prison, I entered

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.570
under a classical entablature.

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:45.800
Classicism for me
growing up was associated

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:54.260
with values which were
eternal and beyond my reality

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.990
as a young person.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:01.370
I'm not sure I've ever outgrown
those versions of classicism.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.695
We have conflicts about
this version of the past.

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:15.295
I said this before, but the
Boston Symphony always--

00:44:15.295 --> 00:44:17.230
they always used to play--

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:19.030
I mean, there's a
concert I want to go

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:24.820
to New York in which Gustavo
Dudamel, the young conductor

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:28.270
of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic Orchestra,

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:31.840
is conducting
Bruckner's Number 8.

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:34.900
If it is a classical
symphony, which

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:38.440
is all of the overtures
of classicism,

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:41.230
it's Bruckner Number 8.

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:44.650
But he is playing
preliminary to it a piece

00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:51.550
by a composer called Corigliano,
a contemporary composer.

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:55.630
The weight of the
piece is in Bruckner.

00:44:55.630 --> 00:45:00.460
So there is a part of us which
establishes in our culture

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:05.860
certain values about
the past as absolute,

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.905
and certain values
about the present as OK.

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.540
We are constantly, in
my view of the world,

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:19.920
balancing these
two problematics,

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.680
coming to a satisfying
conclusions,

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:27.330
even arguing that Mozart's
piano concertos when he returned

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:33.570
to Vienna started accounting for
the popular impulse in music.

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:41.400
And Number 26 is a
wonderful, popular version

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:44.580
of his earlier piano concerto.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.895
I don't know how to leave you
with this Leon Krier position.

00:45:52.895 --> 00:45:55.130
I'll show you some slides.

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:56.390
Look at Poundbury.

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:03.800
The image I've given you is
from the 1976 La Villette

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.570
competition in which he
won the second Prize.

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:12.260
I won't show that to
you in the slides.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.820
It's the last pages of--

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:29.080
In many respects, if you look
at this project in detail--

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.840
particularly the
drawings, he draws,

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.610
and his wife draws, beautifully.

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:47.190
In order to create enough
identity in a 15,000-person,

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:54.170
place even at this density,
he has to introduce a linear

00:46:54.170 --> 00:47:02.330
system down the middle, full
of large buildings, hotels,

00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:04.340
convention centers.

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:09.680
No 15,000 part of a city
can support economically

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.570
this kind of program.

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:16.370
One of the problems that
the new urbanists have

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:20.060
is that in American
densities, if you were not

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:24.470
willing to walk more
than seven minutes,

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:28.340
you can drive to a
7-Eleven and a video store,

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:31.820
let alone to the
diversity of shopping

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:34.640
or commercial
opportunities that you have

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.490
if you increase the density.

00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:40.010
Suburbia is fraught
with the problem

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:43.580
of having too few people.

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:46.530
You can inflate it
as much as you can.

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:49.520
The second problem with
this clear preoccupation

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:55.010
with classicism is that it
doesn't allow for diversity.

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:03.900
The piece I quoted from
myself, in discussion

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:08.220
with Leon Krier at one
meeting, argues that argument.

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:20.160
Let's go on, because I don't
want to run out of time,

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.525
to discussion of memory.

00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:30.910
We know a lot more about
memory than we used to.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:41.150
Across the street, there
are bunch of people.

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:43.070
One of the institutes
is the institute

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:46.460
for memory, the
Picower Institute.

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:53.440
What we know about
memory is that it

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.570
operates through
the existence of 10

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:58.060
to the power of 12 neurons.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:01.460
And what is 10 to
the power of 12?

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:04.480
That's the number of
neurons in the human brain.

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:15.540
Each neuron is connected to
plus-minus 5,000 other cells.

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:20.120
So you have a network
of immense power.

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:23.930
50% of memory is created--

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:39.710
not memory, I'm
sorry, on perception.

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:44.840
Vision commands almost one
half of our brain's cortex.

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.140
To make sense of a picture
that you see through your eyes

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.710
takes half the power.

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:54.260
This requires more
computational power

00:49:54.260 --> 00:50:01.820
than the MIT engineers can
fathom, let alone produce.

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:06.320
Nancy Kanwisher, a
professor across the street,

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.090
writes the following.

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:11.060
I'm quoting her because I
don't want to make mistakes.

00:50:15.845 --> 00:50:19.220
"Object recognition
is no trivial task,

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:23.360
because the visual image doesn't
enter our brains as a developed

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:25.770
photograph."

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:28.730
Imagine that most of
architectural expression

00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:35.832
that I'm talking about is
processed by the visual brain.

00:50:35.832 --> 00:50:38.510
"Rather, it is like
a grid of pixels

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:42.380
on a digital camera, an
array of millions of numbers

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:46.670
indicating light and color
on our eyes' 10 million

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:50.920
or so photoreceptors.

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:53.050
As you walk down
the street, billions

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:59.140
of bits of visual information
strike your field of view.

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:03.820
That view refreshes itself
continuously as objects move,

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:08.080
lighting changes, or you
shift your eyes or your body.

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.090
Still, the briefest
glance is often

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:14.560
enough to recognize even a
never-before-seen objects.

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:17.770
In a fraction of a
second, its visual input

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:21.090
runs from the retina through
increasing the [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:25.060
of the visual stream until it
reaches the cognitive regions

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:25.710
of the brain."

00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:30.490
I'm amazed at this.

00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:41.820
Processing of visual
information is not automatic.

00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:43.070
It is selective.

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:48.470
What you decide to send to
the higher parts of your brain

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:55.160
is based on the selection you
make in the image you see.

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:58.040
Memory is very
difficult to deal with.

00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:05.570
We know it exists
because we have access

00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:07.510
to the cells of the individual.

00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:09.020
But what is collective memory?

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:15.070
I'm going to go through
a bunch of theses.

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:22.900
Let's see if I can goes through
those lists of distinctions.

00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:37.000
Here, I'm giving you a
list of five writers who've

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.070
tried to distinguish
history and memory.

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:50.735
Number 1, "When history ends,
memory begins," Aldo Rossi.

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:57.250
History precedes
memory-- his argument

00:52:57.250 --> 00:53:01.480
is that when a building
changes its function,

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:05.620
it invokes memory and ends
history, which is nonsense.

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:12.370
Maurice Halbwachs
says, general history

00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:16.315
only starts when tradition
ends and the social memory

00:53:16.315 --> 00:53:19.210
is folding or breaking up.

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:22.820
This is the conventional
interpretation.

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:26.920
Memory, if it is as
Halbwachs argues, the result

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:29.110
of social interaction.

00:53:29.110 --> 00:53:31.900
Halbwachs is very outspoken.

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:37.510
He writes a chapter on musical
memory, which is extraordinary.

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:41.260
He argues that it is impossible
to maintain musical memory

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:45.010
without being part of a group.

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:51.100
I am often amazed that a
pianist like Mauricio Pollini

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:59.680
will walk onto a stage
and play for three hours

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:03.670
without looking at a note.

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:07.570
He'll play from Beethoven,
he'll play from Chopin,

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:10.140
he'll play from--

00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:11.980
well, whoever he plays from.

00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:19.730
We still don't know, because
we can't penetrate the brain

00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:22.530
medically.

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:25.280
You can do it only if
you operate on tumors,

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.170
but you cannot--

00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:32.690
most of disease is
understood through symptoms

00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:35.600
or through blood measurements.

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:40.620
You can get neither very
directly from the brain.

00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:44.060
So the brain is the last
part of the human body that

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:49.100
is subject to
research in medicine,

00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:52.160
and the distance it
has to go particularly

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.350
for the neurodegenerative
diseases--

00:54:54.350 --> 00:55:01.190
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
autism, schizophrenia,

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:04.970
is long, long away,
although they are doing

00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:06.560
good work across the street.

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:15.800
So these assumptions about
memory are approximations.

00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:26.020
The only person who has a
very strong view on this

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:29.520
is Pierre Nora the
French philosopher,

00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:33.930
who says, "Memory is life born
by living societies founded

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:35.490
in its name.

00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:38.550
History, on the other hand,
is the reconstruction,

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:41.040
always problematic
and incomplete,

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.140
of what is no longer.

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:46.590
History is perpetually
suspicious of memory,

00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:50.520
and its true mission is to
suppress and destroy it."

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:56.520
This is very antagonistic
view of history's claim

00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:02.640
to coincide with memory,
time separating the two.

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:08.100
He argues that
colonization is based

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:11.520
on destroying the
memory component

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:15.030
of native civilizations.

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:20.200
He also says that postmodernism,
with false history,

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:24.480
fake history, sound
bites, virtual history,

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.550
compounds the problem.

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:33.330
Let's look at some of this
material a little more

00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:36.380
carefully.

00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:41.170
History has a long association--

00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:45.155
sorry, architecture has a
long association with memory.

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:55.940
The mnemonic device
for remembering

00:56:55.940 --> 00:57:02.480
is absolutely present in
the earliest histories.

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:06.020
Memory is quoted in
by Cicero and others

00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:12.500
as occurring when the Greek
Simonedes is at a meeting,

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:16.280
and leaves the meeting
because he's cold outside.

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:18.140
While he's outside,
the building's roof

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:21.530
collapses and kills
everybody in the room.

00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:26.460
He has a capacity of memory,
which reconstructs everybody,

00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:29.690
although the bodies
are disfigured.

00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:32.570
The notion that if
that act of memory

00:57:32.570 --> 00:57:36.470
was an important
phenomenon [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:42.110
classical societies
is made evident

00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:53.180
by the role that mnemonics
played in Greek education.

00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:54.650
Young men would walk--

00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:58.160
not women, young men would
walk around the pyramid,

00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:01.490
and they're concentrating
on the [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:05.090
the architectural
elements of the system.

00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:07.100
They'd walk round
and round and roun

00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:10.280
until it imprinted their minds.

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:13.567
They were open to question
about the constructions

00:58:13.567 --> 00:58:14.150
of the orders.

00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:24.335
Young men were taught to
debate using architecture

00:58:24.335 --> 00:58:25.235
as a mnemonic.

00:58:28.050 --> 00:58:29.290
You make an argument.

00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:32.740
You enter into the
foyer of the building.

00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:35.050
You make your argument.

00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:37.600
You turn right into a room.

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.100
That's your sub-argument.

00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:41.200
You return to the main argument.

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.610
You go to the left.

00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:44.980
You make another
second sub-argument.

00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:46.720
You return to the center.

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:48.250
You go up a staircase.

00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:50.230
You go to the third of the left.

00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:52.360
You return to the main argument.

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.340
You go to the fourth, and so on.

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:57.310
This is a very classical
form of learning.

00:58:57.310 --> 00:59:04.060
But when memory was not
available through television

00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:07.630
or through radio or through
telephones and so on,

00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:10.870
it was a very
precious commodity.

00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:23.180
And architecture as a space
is an important mnemonic.

00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:26.060
Architecture serves
as a memory system

00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:30.020
for ideas about human
origins, a means for recording

00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:32.960
understanding of order and
relationship in the world,

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:37.170
and an attempt to grasp the
concept of the internal cosmos,

00:59:37.170 --> 00:59:41.660
which has no fixed dimensions
with neither beginning nor end.

00:59:46.797 --> 00:59:51.350
There are endless references
to the use of mnemonics.

00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:54.800
Frances Yates' book
on memory and culture

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:57.860
refers to medieval
systems of theater

00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:02.180
writing as
mnemonics-- as devices

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:05.030
for learning about memory.

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:09.920
John Ruskin, the 19th
century British art historian

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:13.730
and philosopher,
writes, "We may remember

01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:16.580
without [INAUDIBLE] memory.

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:21.600
We may live without memory
and worship without memory.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.940
But we--" sorry.

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:28.970
Ruskin wrote a book called
Seven Lamps of Architecture,

01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:31.850
which none of you
know about, I'm sure.

01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:33.470
It's a book.

01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:36.177
Good. how do you know about it?

01:00:36.177 --> 01:00:37.802
AUDIENCE: I took a
class on the history

01:00:37.802 --> 01:00:39.690
of conservation [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:46.480
JULIAN BEINART: Seven Lamps
of Architecture-- sacrifice,

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.410
truth, power, beauty,
life, memory, obedience.

01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:55.030
Why would a 19th century
British art historian

01:00:55.030 --> 01:01:00.097
include memory as one of
the lamps of architecture?

01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:09.080
We cannot remember without her.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.800
These are obsessive arguments.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:22.170
But the whole apparatus of
the built world is a mnemonic.

01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:28.190
It's way of us maintaining
our daily life.

01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:30.895
This is Halbwachs' big point.

01:01:30.895 --> 01:01:33.730
I'll come to it in one minute.

01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:38.230
I'm trying to go through the
others as quickly as I can.

01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:47.470
The arguments about-- in
Jacques [INAUDIBLE] book about--

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:56.490
and in Yale professor
Kirsten Harris'

01:01:56.490 --> 01:02:03.930
writing about the
phenomenon of paradise.

01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:10.890
Paradise Lost is explicit
in its mission to us

01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:15.910
that we have been trying
to recreate paradise.

01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:22.050
[INAUDIBLE] paradise
refers to that.

01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:24.660
[INAUDIBLE] philosophers
have written

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.760
about the loss of paradise.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:32.910
Paradise Lost Who wrote the
epic poem Paradise Lost?

01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:35.580
Milton, Yeah.

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:39.900
I was confusing
with somebody else.

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:46.200
Harris also argues that we are
the only animal species that

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.170
knows that we're going to die.

01:02:49.170 --> 01:03:00.900
Therefore, our capacity
to be beholden to time

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:06.960
is greater, this phenomenon
of the building of ruins.

01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:11.760
The single appearance
of artificial--

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.340
how do you explain the
building of artificial ruins

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:20.880
in the 18th century, given
my argument about memory?

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.640
What is a sophisticated society?

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.390
What is the wealthy and
the sophisticated society

01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:30.285
in [INAUDIBLE] building
ruins on the property?

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.525
We go to Louis Kahn, whom I
quote in my writing on memory.

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:53.890
In the Hurva synagogue, which
was number 3, which is probably

01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:59.770
Louis Kahn's half
dozen best creations,

01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:03.520
although it wasn't
built, he was asked

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.840
to replace the traditional
Jewish synagogue

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.540
in the old city of Jerusalem.

01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:15.220
He refused the rabbi's
implication and said,

01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:17.330
I'm going to build it
on the site next to it.

01:04:17.330 --> 01:04:19.570
I'm going to maintain the ruins.

01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:23.770
Why did he argue for
maintaining the ruins?

01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:27.460
First rule, Kahn says
ruins maintain memory.

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:31.240
What is not built
is not really lost.

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:35.080
Second, a ruin free
of the obligation

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:38.120
to perform active
functions any longer

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.520
is able to fully express
its spirit or formations,

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:47.320
often more so than
whole buildings.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.270
A third aspect of
Kahn's thought is

01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:52.030
his linking of ruins
with the idea of silence.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:05:02.180
And then the fourth, his concept
of the fact that contemporary

01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:07.450
built forms could be given
metaphoric implications

01:05:07.450 --> 01:05:08.062
of ruins.

01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:16.460
The creation of a
perfect paradise

01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:18.980
lies at the center
of architecture.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.615
Paradise on Earth
is a kind of waiting

01:05:23.615 --> 01:05:29.330
room-- an anticipatory
suburb of kingdom come.

01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:35.270
Maurice Halbwachs
remarks that [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:37.580
is first and foremost
due to the fact

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:40.520
that physical objects
of our daily contact

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:43.670
change little or not
at all, providing us

01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:46.190
with an image of
permanence and stability.

01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:57.200
If I had to find my mirror
to shave in the morning,

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:00.260
in a different place
every day, I'd go mad.

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:03.140
I wouldn't shave.

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:06.200
If Memorial Drive changed
its function overnight,

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:10.550
and I had to find a new road
to come to MIT every morning,

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:12.890
I'd go mad.

01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:17.420
Guy de Maupassant
tells a horrible story

01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:21.620
of a mother and daughter
who come to Paris

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:23.870
during the plague epidemic.

01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:26.420
The mother doesn't know that
the daughter has plague.

01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:32.360
She hasn't-- they check into a
hotel where they reserved room.

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.700
The manager of the
hotel recognizes

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:36.770
the plague in the daughter.

01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:39.410
The mother and
daughter check in,

01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:44.000
go out to see doctors
for the rest of the day.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.190
The manager of the
hotel has their room

01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:49.490
changed while they're gone--

01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:50.870
redecorated.

01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:54.200
Their belongings are dispatched.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.440
They return that night,
and the manager tells them

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.030
that they made a mistake.

01:06:59.030 --> 01:07:00.800
They didn't check
into the hotel.

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:07.360
Guy de Maupassant
writes the story

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:12.500
to intrigue us about the need
for permanence [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:17.410
about the everyday fact of
checking into a hotel providing

01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:22.330
us with reasonable
expectations or nourishment.

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:25.210
Halbwachs is very full of this.

01:07:28.890 --> 01:07:30.770
I'll just quote
him in one place.

01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:41.230
"Thus every collective
memory unfolds

01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:43.510
within the spatial framework.

01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:46.300
Space is a reality that endures.

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:49.210
Since our impressions
rush by one after another

01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:51.610
and leave nothing
behind in the mind,

01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:55.090
we can understand how
we recapture the past,

01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:58.750
but only by understanding
how it is in effect preserved

01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:01.030
by our physical surrounding.

01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:04.930
It is to space, the space
we occupy, traverse,

01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:08.620
have continual access
to, or can at any time

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:11.440
reconstruct in
thought or imagination

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.540
that we must turn our attention.

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.840
Our thought must focus on
it if this or that category

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:19.390
of remembrance is to reappear."

01:08:22.279 --> 01:08:26.310
OK, running out
of time as always.

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:27.208
Jesus Christ.

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:42.340
Can't do two lectures in one.

01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:53.319
[INAUDIBLE] I just had a
few important things to say.

01:08:53.319 --> 01:08:56.740
Not important things to
say, but a few things,

01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:59.290
and it's quarter till 2:00.

01:08:59.290 --> 01:09:02.229
There are 30 slides
in each tray,

01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:04.750
so we're not going to make it.

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:09.609
What I suggest is that
I'll give you enough stuff

01:09:09.609 --> 01:09:11.274
to ponder about and read about.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:17.710
We'll take a break, look at
the slides in the first half

01:09:17.710 --> 01:09:20.380
of Thursday's
class, and I'll just

01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:22.950
shorten Thursday's class a bit.

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:25.025
This always happens at
the end of the semester.

01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:35.350
We'll now look at one of the
categories of transference

01:09:35.350 --> 01:09:41.410
of tectonic forms literally
to a new building.

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:45.370
James Ingo Freed writes
about the Holocaust museum.

01:09:45.370 --> 01:09:49.540
"I prefer memory to history
because I prefer the authentic

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:51.729
to the reconstructed."

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:53.830
History is reconstructed.

01:09:53.830 --> 01:09:56.650
Critics of history
are always assuming

01:09:56.650 --> 01:09:59.020
that it's reconstructed.

01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:02.860
That it's based upon
somebody else's measurements

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:06.970
and thought, not the
intuitive impressions that you

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:10.150
create in your own brain.

01:10:10.150 --> 01:10:15.200
Althouth, as Halbwachs points
out, relying on society.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:20.080
"History erases detail
at a painful cost.

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:23.940
It gains consistency through
abstraction and [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:26.740
the loss of the
richness of life.

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:29.660
As a physical artifact
of a given time,

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:32.160
place, and culture,
architectures

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.310
an undistorted, unchanged
thread of memory woven

01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:38.005
into the tapestry of history."

01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:45.600
What he says he's trying to do--

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.135
and we'll see in the images.

01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:53.750
"I discovered that the only
way for me into the Holocaust

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:56.900
was through both the
tectonics of the Holocaust

01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:00.590
and an invented
tectonics of my own.

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:02.780
There was an architecture
of the Holocaust

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:06.074
with its own tectonics
that surround the surface."

01:11:08.846 --> 01:11:19.060
What he's saying
is that the source

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:25.840
of what he wishes to
memorialize has a tectonic form.

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:28.900
He can abstract some
of those tectonics

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:31.180
and reproduce them in
the current version

01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:32.470
of the building.

01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:34.000
What are those forms?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:42.110
Steel, bricks, the use
of space, the clustering

01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:46.145
of the sequence in which
you go through the museum.

01:11:46.145 --> 01:11:50.510
You know that you go
up before you go down.

01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:56.180
Certain artifacts, such as the
little town which was destroyed

01:11:56.180 --> 01:12:02.670
and all the images plastered
on the ceiling, little devices

01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:04.100
which--

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:06.920
the elevated
passageways which have

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:10.940
diagonal structural
reinforcement.

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:14.840
All of these are
tectonic items which

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:21.410
are meant to meld the
present and the past,

01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:25.700
meant to inflict themselves
on your memory in a way

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:29.380
that you are [INAUDIBLE]
with what you're

01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:31.145
seeing as an actual event.

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:41.590
It's very difficult to know
about when this is crap

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:45.861
or whether this is
fundamentally powerful stuff.

01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:50.620
We are in an age where
distortions are so absolute

01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:56.890
and borrowing is so absolute
through virtual media that

01:12:56.890 --> 01:13:01.360
[INAUDIBLE] is a
genuine article--

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:09.050
a genuine borrowing is
difficult to evaluate.

01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:15.860
But I've experienced
the museum a couple

01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:23.060
of times partly as an architect,
partly as just as a citizen.

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.950
The remarkable
thing is that you go

01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:35.240
through the disposition of
evidence, very clinically,

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:38.840
almost historically
accurate evidence.

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.630
The dates of every
single item are.

01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:48.920
Included the mechanical railroad
car that took Jews to Auschwitz

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:54.890
is actually there, or
when America turned down

01:13:54.890 --> 01:14:00.870
the boat of immigrants,
that's there.

01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:06.050
Then you go down and you leave
the building through a room.

01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:10.790
And the room is just
based on the voices

01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:14.330
of people who were
in Auschwitz talking

01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:20.880
about things like,
my mother said to me,

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.610
don't worry about the food.

01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:24.020
You eat the food.

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:26.270
I have had enough already.

01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:28.970
I knew my mother they
had nothing to eat,

01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:32.060
but she was wanting
me to survive.

01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:37.190
The poignancy of that
material touches your memory.

01:14:37.190 --> 01:14:40.670
It evokes your own
experience with your mother

01:14:40.670 --> 01:14:44.070
in Freudian terms.

01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:49.640
So in the piece of
writing I've given to you,

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:54.110
Stan Anderson writes a
piece at a conference which

01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:59.480
I ran in 1994 about memory.

01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:06.095
And Freed and the
French philosopher

01:15:06.095 --> 01:15:10.430
whom I quoted
about memory seemed

01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:17.480
to indicate that we have this
bifocal impression, knowledge

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:19.130
of the past--

01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:23.990
history which is categorical
and empirical and selected

01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:35.150
by other people, an apparently
objective rendition of my past,

01:15:35.150 --> 01:15:40.130
and my own rendition of
my past, which is lively,

01:15:40.130 --> 01:15:45.830
irregular, full of obstacles,
full of juxtapositions.

01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:50.540
Like Freud says, I
can't externalize what

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:54.770
I remember visually very well.

01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:59.810
I could draw my mother next to
my daughter and my grandmother

01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:03.260
and the woman I
see in my dreams,

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:05.270
but I can't put them
all together as I

01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:07.820
can in my psychic experience.

01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:22.630
There's a politics of memory,
the Jews maintaining memory

01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:26.860
through the book, through
the remembrance of Jerusalem

01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:31.300
on an annual ritual,
and so on and so on.

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:36.490
I gave you this piece
from The Boston Globe,

01:16:36.490 --> 01:16:40.360
which is interesting, because
it's a selective memory

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.040
situation.

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:45.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:45.190 --> 01:16:46.610
JULIAN BEINART: Oh, yeah.

01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:51.370
Sorry, I'll give
you the references.

01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:55.180
Mass xeroxing often
cuts out the top.

01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:59.620
It's a critique of Rossi's
book written by, I think,

01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:05.350
Francesco [INAUDIBLE] And
I'll give you the reference.

01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:26.970
At this time of these textile
mills in Lowell, one of us

01:17:26.970 --> 01:17:28.620
here thought how
wonderful it would

01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:33.600
be if we could put the new
University of Massachusetts

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.650
branch.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:35.310
Where's Lowell?

01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:37.140
Lowell's in
Massachusetts, isn't it?

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:38.466
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:17:38.466 --> 01:17:41.280
JULIAN BEINART: Into
these old buildings.

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.310
And we were all doing
sketches in studios

01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:49.660
showing how wonderful
it would be to do this.

01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:52.180
Here's a man who says
those memories were awful.

01:17:56.170 --> 01:18:02.360
What are you memorizing things
of the past that we find awful?

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:07.090
It's a memory, again,
selectively experienced.

01:18:07.090 --> 01:18:14.510
How you, as a professional,
condition your own memory with

01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:19.060
the memory [INAUDIBLE] people,
presumably such a lively

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:23.830
function that the only
thing you can do is--

01:18:26.690 --> 01:18:30.250
in this memory world,
there's some strange things.

01:18:30.250 --> 01:18:40.600
There's an MCP thesis done in
which the student was a trained

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.220
philosopher--

01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:46.150
a phenomenologist.

01:18:46.150 --> 01:18:51.340
And he wrote about
his parents' apartment

01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:58.110
in New York and growing
up, and his reactions when

01:18:58.110 --> 01:19:01.200
they changed the room when
he left to go to college

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.020
and rented the room.

01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:07.635
His whole thesis was
based upon his dreams.

01:19:10.230 --> 01:19:11.720
Fact is, it was a lie.

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:13.250
He never had those dreams.

01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:16.880
He reinvented the
dreams for his thesis.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.670
So it was a complex
mixture of data.

01:19:19.670 --> 01:19:26.690
He should have been failed,
but nobody knew the reality

01:19:26.690 --> 01:19:29.090
until he told us afterwards.

01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:32.540
But it was such a
brilliant set of occasions,

01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:38.270
of being two foot tall and
seeing the refrigerator

01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:39.560
and what it meant.

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:43.040
Seeing the large bed that his
mother and father slept in,

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:46.130
and wondering why they
needed such a large bed,

01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:52.650
and dreaming of
interpolations of that

01:19:52.650 --> 01:19:57.350
as remembered by an adult
and what that would mean

01:19:57.350 --> 01:20:00.645
for architecture understanding.

01:20:00.645 --> 01:20:01.145
Anyway.

01:20:14.770 --> 01:20:17.710
I won't be able
to deal with some

01:20:17.710 --> 01:20:22.360
of the examples
from Washington as

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:26.680
well as I would showing
the history of monuments

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:27.550
in Washington.

01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:36.250
The amazing thing is that
none of the classical features

01:20:36.250 --> 01:20:44.650
of monuments were maintained
since the Vietnam Memorial.

01:20:44.650 --> 01:20:46.030
A couple of things
have happened.

01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:49.215
Number one, the World
War II Memorial,

01:20:49.215 --> 01:20:55.620
there's a neoclassical
construction--

01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:59.560
a Leon Krier construction
with absolutely no

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:03.940
merit at all, other than
in the merit of nostalgia.

01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:12.420
Maya Lin's Vietnam Memorial
is an extraordinary adventure.

01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:16.320
It takes the idea of
connecting a monument

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:18.960
to individual
experience by putting

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.780
the names of the people.

01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:26.790
Your grandson will be able to
go to that name in 25 years time

01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:29.980
or 100 years time.

01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:33.430
Ross Perot's
objection and the need

01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:39.040
to add a soldier a
figure at the entrance

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:44.530
is a stupid attempt to add
nostalgia to the abstraction.

01:21:44.530 --> 01:21:49.160
The power of monuments often
lies in its abstraction,

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:52.270
in its being of
cleansed of irrelevance.

01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:56.080
The obelisk of Washington,
I will show you

01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:01.000
a slide that in the 19th
century, people in Washington--

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:07.350
certain people wanted to
garnish the obelisk memorial

01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:11.580
with evidence of the
inner decoration.

01:22:15.450 --> 01:22:17.790
What has happened
in recent times

01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:25.380
is that we've lost the capacity,
it seems in architecture,

01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:30.770
to memorialize through objects,
through forms themselves.

01:22:30.770 --> 01:22:34.112
AUDIENCE: Is that because
we're lacking the capacity

01:22:34.112 --> 01:22:36.022
to see beyond the evidence?

01:22:36.022 --> 01:22:37.230
JULIAN BEINART: I don't know.

01:22:37.230 --> 01:22:38.670
I wish I could answer that.

01:22:44.210 --> 01:22:54.530
The version of the Roosevelt
Memorial, which is a garden,

01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:59.280
dispenses with the
need of architecture.

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:03.570
The three versions of
the Roosevelt Memorial,

01:23:03.570 --> 01:23:08.400
which I will have shown you,
are large slabs of stone.

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:12.490
From stone to garden is
one of the ways in which

01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:17.280
American culture dispenses
with things it can't deal with,

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:20.740
or has inadequate solutions for.

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:23.460
Nature's always
there to accommodate.

01:23:26.490 --> 01:23:29.550
If you lose in
man-made construction,

01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:31.050
nature is always there.

01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:38.700
That's why I have my doubts
about the constant evocation

01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:39.990
of nature.

01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:45.420
Nature's too friendly a partner
when examined superficially.

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:51.030
We'll look at some of
these images on Thursday

01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:53.490
and see if we can remember
the arguments we made.

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:08.900
The left diagram is
from Rossi's book.

01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:11.420
In fact, both diagrams
are from Rossi's book.

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:20.180
You will recall, Rossi
argues a number of themes--

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:23.780
one about the relationship
between the city

01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:28.880
of the mind and the built city;
number two, between permanences

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:35.700
and temporary parts
of cities; thirdly,

01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:39.860
be the relationship between
institutions and forms,

01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:41.730
and so on and so on.

01:24:41.730 --> 01:24:48.140
Essentially, his argument is
that the ideas and examples

01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:53.420
fossilized in the city which
are worth excavating and using

01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:58.400
is a template for future growth.

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:02.060
The Palazzo [INAUDIBLE]
on the left,

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:08.510
destroyed by a hurricane in
1956 and rebuilt with different

01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:12.830
uses, but maintaining
its place in the city.

01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:16.460
The example on the right
is Carlo Fontana's attempt

01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:21.350
to make the Colosseum into
a church, the argument,

01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:23.840
again, that the
framework of the form

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:28.970
is significant in realizing
an institutional change

01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:32.150
from the killing of
Christians to the celebrating

01:25:32.150 --> 01:25:35.030
of the life of Jesus.

01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:37.760
It doesn't seem to matter.

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:39.080
Next.

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.130
OK.

01:25:40.130 --> 01:25:42.620
This is [INAUDIBLE] in France.

01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:46.880
The influence of the permanence
of the surrounding wall

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:52.490
in Lucca, the Roman
Forum, as an antecedent

01:25:52.490 --> 01:25:55.530
to the most important
public place in the city.

01:25:55.530 --> 01:25:56.030
Next.

01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:06.160
Spalato in the
former Yugoslavia.

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:13.840
An example of the slow--

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:24.970
this is Hadrian's palace, which
is slowly and over time taken

01:26:24.970 --> 01:26:27.880
up by other people and invaded.

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:31.810
And the invasion and the
subsequent disjunction

01:26:31.810 --> 01:26:36.310
between what is there in the
past and what is now built

01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:40.270
is of interest to Rossi.

01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:44.350
This slide on the right is
from the Architettura Razionale

01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:46.150
exhibition in Rome.

01:26:46.150 --> 01:26:47.785
I don't know the date.

01:26:47.785 --> 01:26:50.860
It's an important image.

01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:55.450
It's public housing
or social housing

01:26:55.450 --> 01:26:59.620
on Karl-Marx-Allee in at
that time East Berlin.

01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:03.620
The argument is that
locus is significant,

01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:07.810
even if the
architectural form isn't.

01:27:07.810 --> 01:27:11.800
As the argument would go,
this is the equivalent

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:18.100
of putting social housing
on Fifth Avenue in New York.

01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:24.970
By manifesting locus, or
the importance of location,

01:27:24.970 --> 01:27:28.390
you send important
messages not only

01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:35.005
about the form of the city, but
the meaning of its retention.

01:27:35.005 --> 01:27:35.505
Next.

01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:46.250
The project in Gallaratesse,
a housing project in Milano,

01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:51.710
designed by Aymonino
and Aldo Rossi

01:27:51.710 --> 01:27:59.600
has this extraordinary
empty set of spaces

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:03.440
underneath the
housing on the right.

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:10.050
The idea is that people
who are migrating

01:28:10.050 --> 01:28:16.260
to live in this housing in the
north used to live above shops.

01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:19.990
This is a theme which, if
you're ever interested,

01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:23.820
you should look at
[INAUDIBLE] and look

01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:28.560
at Giancarlo De Carlo's project
in Matera, which I showed you

01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.310
very briefly, where he
makes a point of maintaining

01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:35.580
the shopping
underneath the housing.

01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:39.960
Here, Rossi does an
abstraction of it.

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:43.890
There is no need for
shopping in this project.

01:28:43.890 --> 01:28:48.090
So he relies on people's
memory, and gives them

01:28:48.090 --> 01:28:55.950
enough clues apparently to
situate virtual shopping

01:28:55.950 --> 01:28:58.650
in this space, which is--

01:28:58.650 --> 01:29:05.400
it's a crazy idea, but
he does crazy things.

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:09.330
It's also in line with
his own architecture,

01:29:09.330 --> 01:29:17.910
which has reduced alphabet
of forms as the basis

01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:20.335
for making new things.

01:29:20.335 --> 01:29:20.835
Next.

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:27.730
I was going to show
you two projects

01:29:27.730 --> 01:29:33.220
in San Francisco, which have
relied on the idea of locus

01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:35.560
in redeveloping.

01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:44.320
On the left is the plan of the
Berkeley cooperative society,

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:49.360
which owns the land on the right
of the [INAUDIBLE] Building,

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:54.280
and it wishes to
engage in building

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:58.570
public housing on the property.

01:29:58.570 --> 01:30:05.020
The architects, Marvin
Buchanan and Donlyn Lyndon,

01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:07.480
argue that replacing
all the buildings

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:12.070
would delete the important
elements of the existing

01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:13.730
context.

01:30:13.730 --> 01:30:18.100
The second thing is that, unlike
public housing where people

01:30:18.100 --> 01:30:21.910
are moved from where they
are to somewhere else,

01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:28.030
this maintains the
possibility of maintaining

01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:35.680
the place of where these people
are in relation to the Berkeley

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:37.955
campus just down the road.

01:30:37.955 --> 01:30:38.455
Next.

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:48.730
By choosing to build
public housing in such

01:30:48.730 --> 01:30:55.720
a contorted site, it
demands the introduction

01:30:55.720 --> 01:31:02.990
of more diverse forms
of housing than normal.

01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:08.200
This slide on the left shows
the attempt to maintain a tree

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:10.270
and build around it.

01:31:10.270 --> 01:31:13.180
On the right is the
community celebration

01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:16.480
for the opening of the housing.

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:20.740
The point here is
that the locus is

01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:24.910
the relationship in
space between a place

01:31:24.910 --> 01:31:26.950
and its surroundings.

01:31:26.950 --> 01:31:33.490
Building on that, or creating
a new version of that idea,

01:31:33.490 --> 01:31:37.085
is essentially what
this place has done.

01:31:37.085 --> 01:31:37.585
Next.

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:45.090
This is a project on
the edge of Chinatown

01:31:45.090 --> 01:31:50.700
in San Francisco at the corner
of Stockton and Sacramento

01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:51.930
Street.

01:31:51.930 --> 01:31:55.830
It's a very steeply
sloping site, which

01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:58.770
went through three versions.

01:31:58.770 --> 01:32:02.850
The first version had
told two tall towers.

01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:07.620
And the basement
and the elevation

01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:11.790
on Stockton Street, which is the
main street through Chinatown,

01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:15.090
was given over to
parking and to shops.

01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:21.030
This was during
Richard Nixon's time.

01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:26.040
Richard Nixon needed votes
in California, rather than

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:29.670
San Francisco, rather badly,
and the federal government

01:32:29.670 --> 01:32:33.850
allowed this project to
go through two stages.

01:32:33.850 --> 01:32:37.740
So helped by the local
community churches,

01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:42.870
the project ultimately
resulted in two lower towers,

01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:47.070
both for the Chinese
social housing,

01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:50.220
and the ground floor
turned over to a community

01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:53.940
center and a daycare
center, and the parking

01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:57.840
limited to Chinese groups.

01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:02.280
Just further up the
hill is Nob Hill,

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:06.180
which is some of the most
expensive housing in San

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:07.080
Francisco.

01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:17.390
This is the opening
of the housing.

01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:20.570
Halfway up the hill,
the project has

01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:25.620
a plane, which is only a
horizontal plane available.

01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:29.660
And that is made
into a public space

01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:30.945
at the center of the housing.

01:33:30.945 --> 01:33:31.445
Next.

01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:38.850
You can see the slope looking
downwards and the diagram

01:33:38.850 --> 01:33:40.950
on the right.

01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:45.900
This is all published in
Society & Space for those of you

01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:50.080
interested in researching
this any further.

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:50.580
Next.

01:33:56.650 --> 01:34:06.350
Another contemporary version
of the issue of locus

01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:13.640
is through the highly publicized
invention of the marketplace.

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:17.120
Michael Sorkin is rather
nasty about most things,

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:22.220
calls it a happy
festival place, implying

01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:26.840
that you have to be happy
to enjoy the world of this

01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:38.750
[INAUDIBLE] In both projects,
which maintain the site,

01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:44.930
the notion of the program
is maintained as well.

01:34:44.930 --> 01:34:49.940
Food becomes the
basis of the new site.

01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:58.010
And although the food is
highly selective and priced

01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:03.140
to a market of a
singular kind, there's

01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:08.240
is not much diversity
of population or places

01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:11.145
in this environment.

01:35:11.145 --> 01:35:11.645
Next.

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.740
This is South
Street Seaport done

01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:21.250
by the same
architects as Faneuil

01:35:21.250 --> 01:35:23.740
[INAUDIBLE] Marketplace.

01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:29.950
Here again, it's building
on the locus, if you want,

01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:34.370
of the existing fish market.

01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:34.870
Next.

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:41.510
A third version of
this comparatively

01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:42.950
is Pike Place in Seattle.

01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:50.990
Pike Place in Seattle has been
memorialized by the painter

01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:57.290
Mark Tobey on the right and the
existing market on the left.

01:35:57.290 --> 01:36:01.940
This was a market where
farmers would bring produce

01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:05.240
into the town, and
people would buy directly

01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.430
from the market here.

01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:12.470
There would be no middleman,
no second order clientele.

01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:18.660
In Faneuil Marketplace,
we have British tea sold,

01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:23.870
which is a commodity so removed
from any direct relationship

01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:26.630
between consumer and producer.

01:36:26.630 --> 01:36:34.395
Here, the tradition is
established in these images.

01:36:34.395 --> 01:36:34.895
Next.

01:36:38.610 --> 01:36:44.460
Threatened by urban renewal,
the project on the left

01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:49.290
determines to remove the
vestiges of the market

01:36:49.290 --> 01:36:50.820
altogether.

01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:56.040
And public opposition, organized
by some of the university

01:36:56.040 --> 01:37:05.280
faculty, maintain the idea
of keeping the quality

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:08.890
of a public market as a place.

01:37:08.890 --> 01:37:09.390
Next.

01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:16.720
We'll go through a number
of diverse examples.

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:23.260
Here is the apparatus for
achieving dual meaning.

01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:27.010
On the left is Church
Court at the intersection

01:37:27.010 --> 01:37:30.400
of Mass Avenue
and Beacon Street,

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:36.010
where you can, in one
image next to each other,

01:37:36.010 --> 01:37:41.080
see the contemporary
housing and the old church.

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:47.110
Remember my quotation from
Freud, that in spatial terms,

01:37:47.110 --> 01:37:51.400
you have to separate out images.

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:54.490
You cannot have the same
content in one image.

01:37:54.490 --> 01:37:56.470
Here, they are separated out.

01:38:00.132 --> 01:38:03.610
The example on the right
is also from Boston.

01:38:03.610 --> 01:38:06.070
It's in Newton,
where a restaurant

01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:09.220
has taken over church.

01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:13.600
Churches are seen to be benign
institutions for accommodating

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:17.200
new communal uses.

01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:20.440
We had a student here tried
to do the thesis in Toronto

01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:24.820
on taking a meat
abattoir building

01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:28.570
and turning it into
a housing, and trying

01:38:28.570 --> 01:38:30.760
to deal with the
stigma of making

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:41.375
housing [INAUDIBLE] which
was considered unattractive.

01:38:41.375 --> 01:38:41.875
Next.

01:38:45.010 --> 01:38:49.000
An example of a significant
environmental Rouge plant

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.990
in Detroit memorialized
in a number

01:38:52.990 --> 01:39:00.370
of ways by Sheeler's
photographs on the right--

01:39:00.370 --> 01:39:09.800
next-- by being the home of the
Model T, the first automobile.

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:15.800
Also, the first workers strike
and the formation of a trade

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:21.020
union, and an amplitude
of notions which

01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:23.210
should be memorialized.

01:39:23.210 --> 01:39:26.270
But the absence
of any Rouge plant

01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:29.820
is so large, that there's
nothing to be done.

01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:34.730
There's no use for the Rouge
plant in contemporary Detroit.

01:39:34.730 --> 01:39:40.010
So this is an example where
what should be memorialized

01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:42.930
is lost in the absence
of a new program.

01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:48.420
Next.

01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:58.960
This is the Bicocca
competition in Milano

01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:04.210
on the site of the large
Pirelli tire factory,

01:40:04.210 --> 01:40:11.470
which has moved out, leaving
a lot of infrastructure

01:40:11.470 --> 01:40:18.370
and a [INAUDIBLE] which
is subject to competition

01:40:18.370 --> 01:40:20.950
where almost all the leading
architects the world were

01:40:20.950 --> 01:40:26.510
invited to submit entries.

01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:30.940
I'm going to select two
entries to compare them.

01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:35.260
On the right is
Giancarlo De Carlo's On

01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:38.770
the left is the site plan.

01:40:38.770 --> 01:40:42.130
On the right is Giancarlo
De Carlo version.

01:40:42.130 --> 01:40:46.300
Using a large number of
the existing buildings,

01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:49.270
the whole idea is that
programmatically this

01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:55.030
would become, in Italian,
a new technological pole--

01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:59.530
P-O-L-E. It's only something
Italians can understand.

01:41:02.290 --> 01:41:08.170
What it's meant to be is some
kind of new electronic product

01:41:08.170 --> 01:41:12.160
management enterprise.

01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:16.885
Giancarlo uses a large number
of the existing streets

01:41:16.885 --> 01:41:24.140
and buildings, and introduces
new elements where needed.

01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:24.640
Next.

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:32.010
Gabetti and Isola, a firm
of architects from Torino,

01:41:32.010 --> 01:41:35.520
came second in the
competition, do

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:40.270
something which is interesting.

01:41:40.270 --> 01:41:46.740
They go back to find that
the Romans plow the land--

01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:54.540
organize the land in a
diagonal set of forms.

01:41:54.540 --> 01:42:01.830
And they start working
on this hidden geometry,

01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:06.330
and develop a plan based
upon the hidden geometry

01:42:06.330 --> 01:42:08.370
of the Roman land.

01:42:08.370 --> 01:42:08.870
Next.

01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:15.730
If they then
transfer their design

01:42:15.730 --> 01:42:20.650
into the world of ecology,
it's a green set of buildings.

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:28.540
All of the notions
of other buildings

01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:32.990
should be environmentally
controlled and rationed

01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:36.340
and so on is part of the design.

01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:38.650
The issue that is
interesting here

01:42:38.650 --> 01:42:43.180
is, how do you connect
hidden references

01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:45.090
to existing conditions?

01:42:49.130 --> 01:42:53.270
Who would know the connection
between the Roman fields

01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:54.950
and the new buildings?

01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:56.100
How would you know that?

01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:58.010
How as an architect
do you make--

01:42:58.010 --> 01:43:03.500
you can put up a poster
or a bronze plaque

01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:04.400
telling the story?

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:06.260
But you can't have
the two contents

01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:08.030
simultaneously available.

01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:16.700
We are encumbered, unlike Freud.

01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:18.740
According to Freud,
we as architects,

01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:20.600
who are spatialists,
are encumbered

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:24.590
by not being able to
simultaneously produce

01:43:24.590 --> 01:43:32.145
an experience as presumably
you can in the human brain.

01:43:32.145 --> 01:43:32.645
Next.

01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:39.150
A similar stupid proposition.

01:43:39.150 --> 01:43:42.510
Not stupid proposition, but
more stupid than Gabetti

01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:44.670
and Isola's work.

01:43:44.670 --> 01:43:47.490
They actually are
very good architects.

01:43:47.490 --> 01:43:49.980
And I think in the
Bicocca competition,

01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:56.660
this is the most
interesting projection.

01:43:56.660 --> 01:44:00.370
This is from a studio
at the Harvard GSD.

01:44:00.370 --> 01:44:03.420
The site is Columbus.

01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:06.070
Where's Columbus, Ohio?

01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.570
Yes.

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:14.755
This is where Eisenman is
going to build an art museum.

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:21.340
He digs deep down
under the ground

01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:25.840
to find that this was an
Indian burial ground originally

01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:30.850
on which the Americans
built Camp Sherman, an army

01:44:30.850 --> 01:44:35.260
camp, on which the town
of Chillicothe was built.

01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:37.060
And now it's become Columbus.

01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:44.990
So there are four layers of
geometry, one above the other.

01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:51.850
So by the use of
the term scaling,

01:44:51.850 --> 01:44:56.830
he devises a method of
slowly retrieving the traces

01:44:56.830 --> 01:45:00.275
from underneath upwards.

01:45:00.275 --> 01:45:00.775
Next.

01:45:04.030 --> 01:45:10.930
Through a series of geometrical
moves to ultimately induce

01:45:10.930 --> 01:45:14.455
a solution for the museum.

01:45:17.050 --> 01:45:20.980
The problem again is the same
one as the Bicocca competition

01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:23.900
problem.

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:29.510
What is the record of your
invention made public?

01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:32.960
How available is
the relationship

01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:37.950
between your final
product and your work?

01:45:37.950 --> 01:45:43.610
Who in heaven's name would
know the relationship

01:45:43.610 --> 01:45:47.300
as an outside experience?

01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:53.150
In any case, what is the point
of digging for inspiration

01:45:53.150 --> 01:45:55.890
under the ground when
you have [INAUDIBLE]

01:45:55.890 --> 01:45:59.150
atrophy of
conventional geometries

01:45:59.150 --> 01:46:02.000
to use for architecture?

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.570
What is the advantage?

01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:08.070
It's a problematic question.

01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:10.940
Nobody at the GSD
asked the question.

01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:12.620
This became a wonderful game.

01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:20.080
There is no virgin
territory in this sense.

01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:24.220
Everything has an underneath
evocation of some use.

01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:31.220
It's landscape
urbanism penetrating

01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:33.740
beneath the skin
of the landscape

01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:40.205
into some territory, which is
enough to gestate new forms.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:43.500
Next.

01:46:46.662 --> 01:46:55.010
This [INAUDIBLE] work
on the grid of Chicago,

01:46:55.010 --> 01:46:58.690
producing this through a
series of exercises, scaling

01:46:58.690 --> 01:47:01.490
and transmission,
is equally stupid.

01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:05.110
Mixed.

01:47:05.110 --> 01:47:10.510
Not stupid-- intellectually
interesting, but so what.

01:47:13.490 --> 01:47:15.740
This is not a painting class.

01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:25.380
Do you need to know-- when
you look at a painting of Van

01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:31.290
Gogh's painted when he was in
asylum in the south of France,

01:47:31.290 --> 01:47:35.670
and he painted through a
particular window looking

01:47:35.670 --> 01:47:39.930
across the landscape, you
don't know this background.

01:47:39.930 --> 01:47:41.890
You just look at the painting.

01:47:41.890 --> 01:47:45.630
The painting has to
have enough in itself

01:47:45.630 --> 01:47:48.570
that the history is redundant.

01:47:48.570 --> 01:47:51.810
Who goes to an art
exhibition and demands

01:47:51.810 --> 01:47:57.280
that they understand the
history of each painting?

01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:04.650
How much of the history is part
of the experience of the art?

01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:11.750
I'm asking you a question.

01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:12.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:25.835
You cannot really appreciate
a Japanese sword katana done

01:48:25.835 --> 01:48:30.955
by [INAUDIBLE] without knowing
the context in which it was

01:48:30.955 --> 01:48:31.455
made.

01:48:31.455 --> 01:48:33.290
JULIAN BEINART:
No, I understand.

01:48:33.290 --> 01:48:35.150
That's what we have museums for.

01:48:39.074 --> 01:48:40.352
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:48:40.352 --> 01:48:41.810
JULIAN BEINART: An
art production--

01:48:41.810 --> 01:48:46.580
sorry, an art production should
be able to stand on its own,

01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:51.560
independent of the knowledge
of the culture and so on.

01:48:54.930 --> 01:48:59.970
That's my own sense
of the capacity

01:48:59.970 --> 01:49:06.160
that we all have to
abstract from form ideas.

01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:08.080
AUDIENCE: Can you
explain different layers

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:11.578
of meaning [INAUDIBLE]

01:49:11.578 --> 01:49:13.120
JULIAN BEINART: You
might-- now, as I

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:17.110
said before, in looking
at a Van Gogh painting,

01:49:17.110 --> 01:49:19.780
you may well want to go
back to his drawings.

01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:22.810
You want to read his
letters to his brother.

01:49:22.810 --> 01:49:27.470
You want to understand his
epilepsy, and so on and so on.

01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:30.910
But essentially, given the
canvas in front of you,

01:49:30.910 --> 01:49:34.840
it should have enough content.

01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:41.260
You can increase the content,
but it cannot be totally

01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:49.060
dependent on your ability
to connect backwards.

01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:51.160
These examples we
just looked at,

01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:54.070
from Eisenman and
Gabetti and Isola,

01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:56.890
depend on your ability to--

01:49:56.890 --> 01:50:00.580
there's no evidence.

01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:03.010
Well, the new building
may be a consummate work

01:50:03.010 --> 01:50:08.650
of art, in which case reference
backward is immaterial.

01:50:08.650 --> 01:50:16.150
But as a device for
creating urbanism,

01:50:16.150 --> 01:50:17.950
it's a difficult argument.

01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:22.900
I'll concede the
difficulty of the argument.

01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:28.540
When Haydn uses the data
of his wife's birthday

01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:31.810
as the beginning
of some music, does

01:50:31.810 --> 01:50:36.880
the music quality
depend on you knowing

01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:39.730
that it was the
trivialization which

01:50:39.730 --> 01:50:42.010
caused him to write the music--

01:50:42.010 --> 01:50:45.670
a trivial beginning?

01:50:45.670 --> 01:50:52.450
I tend to argue in
favor of what you

01:50:52.450 --> 01:50:55.570
see being able to be
explained by what you see.

01:51:00.016 --> 01:51:04.520
AUDIENCE: Julian, we had in in
Politecnico di Milano an entire

01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:13.190
class for one year that was
about retracing the [INAUDIBLE]

01:51:13.190 --> 01:51:17.270
and then doing a project
[INAUDIBLE] But I would say,

01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:20.450
all my education in
Italy was-- like,

01:51:20.450 --> 01:51:27.800
urban design education was
strongly based on retracing

01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:36.150
former traces or ruins of
whatever was previously,

01:51:36.150 --> 01:51:41.700
and then integrating them into
the [INAUDIBLE] It was the word

01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:46.090
[INAUDIBLE] was
oriented towards--

01:51:46.090 --> 01:51:48.620
JULIAN BEINART: So it means
you can't build in America.

01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:52.890
AUDIENCE: It means that I felt
really lost when I came here,

01:51:52.890 --> 01:51:54.853
and then there was [INAUDIBLE].

01:51:54.853 --> 01:51:56.520
JULIAN BEINART: But
I'm just showing you

01:51:56.520 --> 01:52:01.150
that Eisenman found four
layers in Columbus, Ohio.

01:52:01.150 --> 01:52:01.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:09.563
But it's-- yes,
[INAUDIBLE] like that.

01:52:09.563 --> 01:52:10.980
JULIAN BEINART:
There are no doubt

01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:15.870
instances where retrieving
ideas from the past

01:52:15.870 --> 01:52:20.610
is significant in
connecting you to something

01:52:20.610 --> 01:52:21.980
interesting about the future.

01:52:24.630 --> 01:52:25.935
This comes up very often.

01:52:25.935 --> 01:52:28.420
AUDIENCE: There shouldn't
be a restriction,

01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:33.020
because if you just need
to anchor it to the past,

01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:35.400
that means that there
is no room for a fully

01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:37.610
original idea from scratch.

01:52:37.610 --> 01:52:40.315
So it needn't be--

01:52:40.315 --> 01:52:43.920
[INAUDIBLE] to be
exclusive in nature.

01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:46.470
JULIAN BEINART: Well, I
wonder how many people

01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:49.260
have original ideas
from scratch, anyway.

01:52:49.260 --> 01:52:53.160
We all beleaguered by knowledge.

01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:56.670
Some is explicit, so is not.

01:52:56.670 --> 01:52:59.440
I don't know exactly
why I draw my hand,

01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:01.770
and draw in a particular way.

01:53:01.770 --> 01:53:04.050
Neither did Picasso.

01:53:04.050 --> 01:53:06.850
I mean, he drew in 70,000 ways.

01:53:06.850 --> 01:53:08.820
Sometimes, it's
clear [INAUDIBLE]

01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:12.390
art historians to show
what he was trying to do.

01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:21.520
Sometimes, he just draws with a
hidden vocabulary of knowledge.

01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:23.170
It's a contentious issue.

01:53:23.170 --> 01:53:27.790
All I'm trying to argue
is that these examples all

01:53:27.790 --> 01:53:33.250
try to connect you to
previous knowledge.

01:53:33.250 --> 01:53:36.790
AUDIENCE: Because of the
preservation that they want--

01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:39.870
it's all about preservation,
your view and your perspective

01:53:39.870 --> 01:53:42.355
on that, I guess.

01:53:42.355 --> 01:53:47.010
And I don't think during
our education in the US,

01:53:47.010 --> 01:53:49.160
we don't have so
much focus on that.

01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:50.800
JULIAN BEINART: No.

01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:52.990
Understandably, if
you grew up in Italy,

01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:58.240
it's a little difficult to
bypass the extraordinary things

01:53:58.240 --> 01:53:59.890
that have been done.

01:53:59.890 --> 01:54:03.100
If you grew up in
Greece, of course--

01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:08.440
Georgeas is not here today.

01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:09.610
He grew up in Greece.

01:54:09.610 --> 01:54:12.190
I wonder what you would
make of reconstructing

01:54:12.190 --> 01:54:19.780
the Agora as an item worth
generating a new vocabulary.

01:54:19.780 --> 01:54:22.910
Have you been to
the Agora in Athens?

01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:25.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:26.750
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:29.270
No, I'm thinking of
the Agora particularly,

01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:33.620
because it's such an
extraordinary difficult

01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:34.340
phenomenon--

01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:40.820
37 acres of land to invoke.

01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:48.620
The Romans-- [INAUDIBLE] was a
much easier literal formulation

01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:52.370
to seek adaptations from.

01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:55.430
The Greeks didn't
believe in the cardinal.

01:54:55.430 --> 01:55:00.530
There is no cardinality in
the Agora in Athens There

01:55:00.530 --> 01:55:04.580
no organization based upon
a simple precept, such

01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:08.360
as you need a horizontal line
and a vertical line to cross.

01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:14.850
This is complex
territory, and I'm

01:55:14.850 --> 01:55:18.660
not enough of an art historian
to take this further.

01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:20.130
Let's move to Leon Krier.

01:55:23.090 --> 01:55:30.740
First of all, there is stupid
distinction between res privata

01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:32.900
and res publica.

01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:34.760
In the next class,
which we'll do

01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:38.660
in this start in the second
half after these pictures,

01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:45.980
I'll try to show you how
inappropriate this distinction

01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:47.000
is.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.820
For him, a good city is one
in which the public domain is

01:55:52.820 --> 01:55:57.770
evidenced through a series
of architectural forms

01:55:57.770 --> 01:56:00.890
which deviate really
from classical form,

01:56:00.890 --> 01:56:04.160
or deviate, which are
determined by their allegiance

01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:05.790
to classical form.

01:56:05.790 --> 01:56:06.290
Next.

01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:15.490
The world of the private are
really rectangular boxes.

01:56:15.490 --> 01:56:18.850
A good city is
one which combines

01:56:18.850 --> 01:56:24.880
the two, in which the public
is signally differentiated

01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:25.600
from the private.

01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:30.830
What happens if you
are wealthy and you

01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:37.680
want to put a classical arch
in the front of your house,

01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:38.910
I don't know.

01:56:38.910 --> 01:56:41.380
But let's leave that example.

01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:41.880
Next.

01:56:44.862 --> 01:56:51.570
The use of classicism in this
project of his for an island

01:56:51.570 --> 01:56:57.390
resort off the coast of Africa.

01:56:57.390 --> 01:57:03.600
It aims to recreate
a context borrowed

01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:05.580
from a significant past.

01:57:09.700 --> 01:57:13.080
It may be exotic enough
to attract people

01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:18.180
looking for another
experience in life, even

01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:29.220
if it's quixotic and veneer
and lacking in originality.

01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:33.750
But then, who cares what
the original consequence

01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:36.060
of classical architecture was?

01:57:38.350 --> 01:57:38.850
Next.

01:57:42.810 --> 01:57:46.530
When it's taken seriously,
such as by Prince Charles

01:57:46.530 --> 01:57:49.500
and his confreres
in England, you

01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:54.290
see a political
argument made in favor

01:57:54.290 --> 01:58:00.750
of Canaletto's version of London
and what London has become.

01:58:00.750 --> 01:58:02.640
According to Prince
Charles, London

01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:05.980
has been brutalized by
modern architecture.

01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:06.480
Next.

01:58:09.850 --> 01:58:13.360
So Richmond Terrace on
the left on the Thames

01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:18.490
is an office complex designed
by Quinlan Terry, who

01:58:18.490 --> 01:58:22.240
works with classical
architecture, as opposed

01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:29.020
to these ugly buildings,
which the Prince assigns

01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:32.200
to modern architecture.

01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:41.350
So here is the attempt to use
an architectural form, derived

01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:45.700
from classicism quite
freely, to maintain

01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:52.820
a certain civility of form
and a certain expression,

01:58:52.820 --> 01:58:56.020
which is universally
admired and understood,

01:58:56.020 --> 01:58:58.460
instead of the
arbitrary selections

01:58:58.460 --> 01:59:00.740
of form under modernism.

01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:01.240
Next.

01:59:07.170 --> 01:59:13.980
In the Holocaust
Museum in Washington,

01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:17.340
the architect says that
he wishes to excavate

01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:20.070
memory instead of history.

01:59:20.070 --> 01:59:25.170
So he makes the intellectual
leap, or the artistic leap,

01:59:25.170 --> 01:59:30.870
by taking forms which
emanate from Auschwitz,

01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:34.200
and introducing them into
the vocabulary of forms

01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:36.630
that he uses in the Holocause--

01:59:36.630 --> 01:59:42.950
bricks, steel, triangular
metal sections.

01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:43.450
Next.

01:59:53.130 --> 01:59:57.780
In keeping with
Washingtonian urbanism,

01:59:57.780 --> 02:00:02.940
the interior of the
building is exotic.

02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:07.200
The performance of the
building as it faces the public

02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:07.810
is quiet.

02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:11.460
Next.

02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:21.840
Similarly, on the left is a plan
by a Dutch landscape architect

02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:25.230
of, up above, field patterns.

02:00:25.230 --> 02:00:29.640
Below is a housing project
based on the field patterns

02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:33.390
of the previous agriculture.

02:00:33.390 --> 02:00:38.180
And on the right is a
house in Switzerland

02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:46.160
by Mario Botta, who says,
"I'm obliged to build

02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:50.060
a building in suburbia and
isolate the building, which

02:00:50.060 --> 02:00:51.460
I don't like.

02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:53.790
I'm going to do it,
but at the same time,

02:00:53.790 --> 02:00:57.800
I'm going to deviate its form
so significantly that it's

02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:00.560
a different product altogether."

02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:05.990
So here is the
argument on the left

02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:16.280
that there's enough trace
again for you to impose on it

02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:19.880
an argument of consonance.

02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:25.730
On the right is an acceptance
of a certain spatial vocabulary,

02:01:25.730 --> 02:01:32.060
but then in particular denying
the vocabulary by making it

02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:32.970
round.

02:01:32.970 --> 02:01:33.470
Next.

02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:42.350
Here is a simple example.

02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:46.880
In Groningen, in
Holland, a library

02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:50.450
is extended by building
it as exactly--

02:01:50.450 --> 02:01:54.260
building two new
arms of it parallel

02:01:54.260 --> 02:01:56.210
to the existing building.

02:01:56.210 --> 02:01:59.325
There's no question but
that they should look like.

02:01:59.325 --> 02:01:59.825
Next.

02:02:03.210 --> 02:02:10.170
And lastly, a few
ideas from Washington.

02:02:10.170 --> 02:02:22.130
Washington's plan made
selecting site for monument

02:02:22.130 --> 02:02:28.035
and the maintenance of memory
through monument quite easy.

02:02:28.035 --> 02:02:28.535
Next.

02:02:33.890 --> 02:02:37.370
Let's jump to the
contemporary problem.

02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:39.020
These are two.

02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:49.220
On the left is the first attempt
to design the FDR Memorial.

02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:56.870
These panels of stone are taller
than the Washington Monument.

02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:59.730
The family objects.

02:02:59.730 --> 02:03:02.420
Another architect is
brought in to reduce

02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:06.540
the height of the panels
down to a smaller level.

02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:07.040
Next.

02:03:10.970 --> 02:03:16.010
The last outcome was the attempt
to leave architecture alone

02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:22.640
and to use a garden as
the appropriate memorial.

02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:27.590
Now, this is either because
contemporary architecture

02:03:27.590 --> 02:03:30.560
has no way of doing memorials.

02:03:35.370 --> 02:03:37.810
Do you know Frank
Geary's proposition

02:03:37.810 --> 02:03:41.170
for the Eisenhower Memorial?

02:03:41.170 --> 02:03:44.380
Has anybody seen it?

02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:48.220
It's under grave
discussion at the moment

02:03:48.220 --> 02:03:51.010
as to whether it's
acceptable or not.

02:03:51.010 --> 02:03:56.320
It has none of Geary's formal
language of architecture

02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:58.340
as embedded in the project.

02:04:04.490 --> 02:04:09.850
This is a case where nature
is seen as invariably benign.

02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:16.870
If you can't do a man-made
manifestation of something,

02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:20.195
you rely on nature
to do it for you.

02:04:20.195 --> 02:04:20.695
Next.

02:04:27.060 --> 02:04:30.270
This is a late 19th
century attempt

02:04:30.270 --> 02:04:48.630
to cover the existing obelisk
with an armature which renders

02:04:48.630 --> 02:04:52.980
it more publicly acceptable.

02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:59.880
It's probably the
finiteness of a monument.

02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:04.890
The obelisk is, after all,
a very elementary geometry,

02:05:04.890 --> 02:05:08.700
which needs to be denied
by those who need to give

02:05:08.700 --> 02:05:11.220
it more appropriate meaning.

02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:13.260
The same thing on the right.

02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:17.730
This is Ross Perot's addition
to the Vietnam Memorial.

02:05:17.730 --> 02:05:21.630
Maya Lin's memorial
is absently abstract.

02:05:21.630 --> 02:05:27.060
It has only vertical
planes with names on it.

02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:30.810
In order to render
it more acceptable,

02:05:30.810 --> 02:05:39.600
we get the addition of this
example of human soldiers.

02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:40.950
No women, of course.

02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:49.150
The abstraction allows
almost everybody

02:05:49.150 --> 02:06:01.250
to take part in it, whereas once
you express particularities,

02:06:01.250 --> 02:06:06.770
you have the problem of what
particularities to choose.

02:06:06.770 --> 02:06:10.700
An obelisk is universal.

02:06:10.700 --> 02:06:14.480
A decorated obelisk
means that somebody

02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:19.260
had to make decisions about what
is the appropriate decoration.

02:06:19.260 --> 02:06:19.760
Next.

02:06:23.130 --> 02:06:27.030
And two last examples of
a contemporary monument

02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:33.930
are expressions of the need to
retain memory about something.

02:06:33.930 --> 02:06:39.780
On the left is the Navy
Memorial in Washington.

02:06:39.780 --> 02:06:43.920
It's a developer project which
has left a space in front,

02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:48.960
a circular space with a single
figure of a soldier that

02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:50.670
is the Navy sailor.

02:06:50.670 --> 02:06:56.010
It's a male again-- white
male, on top of the world.

02:06:56.010 --> 02:07:00.420
But at the same time, you
enter a door to the right,

02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:03.480
and you go inside
this interior space,

02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:07.290
where you can see a movie about
the wonder of the United States

02:07:07.290 --> 02:07:08.110
Navy.

02:07:08.110 --> 02:07:10.110
And there's also
a computer which

02:07:10.110 --> 02:07:14.520
will show your grandchild
how wonderful you were

02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:17.760
when you were a young sailor.

02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:19.530
Next.

02:07:19.530 --> 02:07:22.775
The Air Force Memorial
tried to do the same thing.

02:07:22.775 --> 02:07:26.460
Here is the first project
for the Air Force Memorial.

02:07:26.460 --> 02:07:30.000
It sits on a plinth,
which is the updated

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:34.860
version of the world on top of
a symbolic representation, which

02:07:34.860 --> 02:07:38.010
is fixed.

02:07:38.010 --> 02:07:42.450
Here, you have a
combination of the idea

02:07:42.450 --> 02:07:48.400
that the memorial, which is
only fixed and not updatable,

02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:55.030
needs to have an updating system
as a part of a binary system--

02:07:55.030 --> 02:08:01.750
one perpetual one
updated contemporary.

02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:12.170
I think these two are
examples of a kind of move

02:08:12.170 --> 02:08:21.260
to democratize or bring
architectural form

02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:26.610
into everyday existence.

02:08:26.610 --> 02:08:29.040
I don't know how
successful these will be.

02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:35.770
Next.

02:08:35.770 --> 02:08:40.090
It's the [INAUDIBLE] OK, we've
gone through a whole series

02:08:40.090 --> 02:08:44.020
of examples of issues.
