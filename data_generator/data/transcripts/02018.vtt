00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.980
PROFESSOR: So as a
more technical aside,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.200
let's analyze more
carefully the problem

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.970
of release of viral load from
a drop by process of diffusion.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.250
So here, again, I
sketch a droplet,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.970
which would typically be an
aerosol droplet in the size

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.890
range of, let's say, microns.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.650
And the virion of
interest has a size

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.680
that is much smaller than that
on the order of, let's say,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.480
100 nanometers.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.870
And this white path is showing
how such a virion would

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.430
go from its initial position R,
let's say, as a radio position,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.380
to the boundary.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.800
Now, the general
problem of finding

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.510
the expected first passage time
from the point inside a domain

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.240
to a boundary is a
classical problem

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.480
in the theory of stochastic
processes and random walks.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.830
And it has the following
representation.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.340
So the mean are
expected first passage

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:14.120
time from a point to
an absorbing surface

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.120
solves the following problem.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.150
Is the Laplacian of that
time with a minus sign

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.870
is 1 over D where D
is the diffusivity.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.010
And so this is the DV
that I described before,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.780
the diffusivity of the virion.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.780
And the boundary condition
for this equation

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.530
is that it's an absorbing
boundary, basically.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.810
So when the virion gets
to the surface it's gone.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.430
And that's when the
stochastic process finishes.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.030
So it's tau equals 0 on
radius capital R, which

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.280
is the radius of the droplets.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.440
So that's on the boundary.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:57.320
So in the case of a
spherical drop, then

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.980
we can write this equation
in spherical coordinates.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.070
So that's minus 1 over
r-squared, r derivative

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.030
of r-squared D
tau DR. And that's

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.860
equal to 1 over capital D.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.450
And then again, our
boundary condition

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.850
is the tau of capital
R is equal to zero.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.590
Another boundary condition we might
mention is that D tau DR at R

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.780
equals 0 is zero.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.329
That's a symmetry
boundary condition.

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.380
So when you're right in
the middle, basically,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.700
there should be no--

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.350
there's no favorite direction
for the diffusion process.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.150
And so, therefore, the
derivative this time

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.090
with respect to R must
be 0 at the center

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.200
because it's a symmetry
boundary condition.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.260
OK, so we can now go ahead
and solve this problem.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.740
Let me put the r-squared on
their side and use primes

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.380
with no derivatives.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.790
So let's write this
as r-squared tau

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.410
prime, prime equals
minus r-squared over d.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.780
And if I now
integrate both sides,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.970
I get r-squared
tau prime equals--

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.810
and then here we
get a minus r-cubed

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.030
over 3D plus a constant.

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.000
And that constant immigration
according to the symmetry

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.240
boundary condition has to
be 0, because tau prime is

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.910
0 at r equals 0.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.950
So we can simplify
this and write

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.150
tau prime is minus r over 3D.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.360
And so then I can
integrate again.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.680
And I found that tau of r is--

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.260
well, I integrate this,
I get r squared over 2

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.040
is integral of r.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.680
So that gives that
an r-squared over 6.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.210
So there will be a 6
D and minus r-squared.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.280
And there'll be a
constant integration.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.370
And in order to satisfy this
boundary condition of vanishing

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.290
a capital R, you
can see that I can

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.910
write the constant this way.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.490
And I'll write it as
capital R squared over 6D

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.780
is a constant of integration.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.360
So basically, the profile of
the main first passage time

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.560
is essentially a parabola.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.269
So as a function of distance R
from the center of the droplet,

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.640
you have this shape to the
mean transmission time.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.910
And the maximum here,
the maximum value

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.260
is tau 0 is the maximum value.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.720
And that is r-squared over 60.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.950
So that's if you happen
to be unlucky and right

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:39.540
in the middle.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.090
That's the longest
you would expect

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.040
to take from a particular part.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.920
Now on the other hand,
as I've sketched here,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.320
in a typical droplet, if
the virions are randomly

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.409
distributed, some of them,
like this guy over here,

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:53.030
happen to be very
close to the surface.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.280
So you're not going to have
to wait this long for them

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.790
to escape.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.340
So now we can ask the question,
what is the average escape

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.340
time over all the initial
positions of the virus,

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.100
or virion, assuming that
the virions are uniformly

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.130
distributed at random in
the initial condition.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.090
So if we do that, then
we're solving for the--

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.180
that's all [INAUDIBLE],,
so I'll put it over here.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:24.600
The average escape time or
first passage time for the virus

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.150
will be tau bar.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.210
Well, what I'll do is
I'll integrate over

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.770
all the positions and
then divide by the volume

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.550
because a uniform distribution.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.909
So I'll write the
integral over the volume

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:39.840
as 4 pi, the solid angle times
integral from 0 to capital

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:47.340
R of tau of r r-squared DR. And
I'll divide by the total volume

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.720
4/3 pi capital r-cubed.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.900
OK, so if we do
this integral here,

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.820
so when we plug-in
this, first of all,

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.470
we can see that
we get, obviously,

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.540
for the constant term,
r-squared over 60,

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.810
we just have a ratio of volume
over volume, which is one.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.380
So we get r squared
over 6D is the first term,

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.850
just integrating that constant.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.040
But then it's 1 minus.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.980
And then instead
of r-squared, you

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.940
have r-squared times
this r-squared.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.440
It says r to fourth.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.600
So you integrate that.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.780
You get r to the fifth over 5.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.800
And so then you get
1/5 over this 1/3 here.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.460
And that gives you 3/5.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.490
And so that gives, when
I subtract one minus 3/5,

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.750
I get 2/5.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.120
And 2 over 6 is 1/3.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.940
And so this ends up
being r-squared over 15D

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.490
as we had previously quoted.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.830
So it's worth going through
the calculation just to see.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.659
This number 15 is an
order of magnitude.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.530
It's larger than 10.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.070
So while we normally
estimate diffusion times

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.640
to be of order length
squared divided by D,

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.010
so r-squared over
d, this calculation

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.130
shows that the actual
average time is much smaller

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.110
than that by a factor of 15.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.870
And that's precisely because
the virus virions sometimes

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.700
find themselves initially
near the surface.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.870
So they get out more easily.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.490
So you don't have to
wait for diffusion

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.690
across the entire drop.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.370
That sets the overall scale.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.340
But the average
drop diffusion time

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.760
is actually less than that.
