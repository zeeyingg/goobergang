JULIAN BEINART: The
next three classes

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.270
deal with a discussion of three
models, which we developed

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.020
in this class with Kevin
Lynch, and I've subsequently

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.260
changed and added to.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.200
The three models are not unique.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.620
They are examples
of models which

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.740
inform the form of the
city, have instructions

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:05.880
as who should take part,
have premises of materialism

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.180
or theism associated with them.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.780
I'll go through the
first one today,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.450
what we call the cosmic model.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.100
And you can see that the
definitions of states

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:35.730
is subjective, control
science, nature, type, and form

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.365
tools will be what we will
discuss in this class.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.390
The most common
theory associated

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.870
with the beginning of cities
has a materialist basis.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.170
This is of course wrong.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.020
The materialist basis
is based on the notion

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.590
that a surplus is produced
through agriculture.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.190
And a surplus requires a system
of bureaucracy, a literature,

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:24.260
or literal elite, a method for
controlling irrigation systems,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.380
and so on, and the
primitive notions of trade.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.000
Why don't I just read you
a standard explanation

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.140
of surplus, because you
should remember the word.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.320
It's an important
word in the theory

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.700
of city form, the notion
of the production of more

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.470
than you need.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.700
It involves storage, it
involves the world of--

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.680
that's why I regard the
invention of the potter's wheel

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.470
is one of the more significant
inventions of humankind.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.670
How do you store food?

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.610
What do you do with
the surplus of food

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.070
unless you have commodities
or containers that

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.155
can separate the food from the
corrosion forces of nature--

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.395
the surplus.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.750
"Surplus production
beyond the immediate needs

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.950
of the community made possible
the emancipation of some people

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.470
from the toils of the land."

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.270
Here's an interesting
observation--

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.040
that if you produce excess,
you relieve certain people

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.550
of conventional duties.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.790
We have excess
which relieves a man

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.120
to become the conductor of
the New York Philharmonic

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.890
Orchestra.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.920
It's only when you
have a surplus which

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.050
is not taken into account in
much of our modern economics.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.230
"But this creates
the opportunity

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.060
for specialized
source and groups

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.490
associated with namely scribes,
craftsmen, priests, warriors.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.190
Surplus production
presumes irrigation

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.600
and efficient irrigation system
produces a complex bureaucracy.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.390
And that means cities."

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:38.290
This theory, materialist
theory, is best written

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.580
about in Gideon Sjoberg's
book, The Preindustrial City--

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.330
S-J-O-B-E-R-G-- and in Gordon
Child, an Australian writer,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.370
who wrote a book called
Man Makes Himself.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.360
These are classic depictions
of surplus theory.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.060
There's a version of
surplus subdivision,

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.730
of surplus theory
into two kinds.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.140
One held by Jane
Jacobs in her book

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.620
The Economy of Cities,
which argues that

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.530
in the town of Catalhuyuk--

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:21.100
C-A-T-A-L-H-U-Y-U-K, was
the center for industrial

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.410
production of obsidian.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.040
And agricultural served,
as it does conventionally

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.250
in our societies, as
the source of production

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.380
for industrial commodities
such as obsidian.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.460
This is different from the
agricultural surplus, which

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.610
regards agriculture as
the primary function

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.390
and pays no attention
to material production.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.740
Most students of
the origin of cities

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.380
now don't believe in either
of these two propositions.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.530
So forget them.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.670
They're not important.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:15.530
The common version
of this new theory

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:21.950
suggests that original cities
were ceremonial centers, places

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.300
of holy ritual, which explains
the risky force of nature

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.340
and secured them
for human benefit.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.520
Peasants supported
them voluntarily,

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.020
attracted by their
holy power, thus

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:41.420
arose a permanent priestly
class, awesome and seductive.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.290
Only later did the marks of
urban civilization appear--

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.970
ore, trade, writing, extensive
cross-specialization, and so

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.090
on.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.230
So that the first cities
were mental weapons, not

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.290
physical forces.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:04.510
Now, let's look at some of
this a bit more carefully.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:17.590
Joseph Rykwert in a book called
The Idea of a Town writing

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:22.390
about the definition
of Roman cities--

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.390
"the Romans are considered
to be the prime rationalists

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:32.680
of ancient times and
the towns are often

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.570
seen as rational outcomes
of surveying technique

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:46.370
and military fortification.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.390
I quote, Rykwert says,
"the town is not really

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.810
a natural phenomenon,"
here setting up

00:07:53.810 --> 00:08:00.140
a distinction between the
form of the town and nature.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.230
We'll get into the
fallacies of biomorphosis

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.780
and so on as we go
through this class.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.440
You will understand that
I'm not a naturalist.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.330
I understand that everything
that happens around us

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.020
is processed by the
amount of material,

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.190
the 1,250 cubic centimeters
in the human brain.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:30.190
It's interesting in talking
about the cosmic model

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:35.169
to notice the definition
in formal religion

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:37.610
of the idea of heaven.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.200
Heaven is only a
concept of humankind.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.515
We'll touch on that a bit later.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.925
Lewis Mumford-- just choosing
little bits from these

00:08:55.925 --> 00:08:56.425
sources--

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.740
"the original aspects
of temporary settlements

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.440
have to do with sacred
things, not just

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.720
with the physical environment.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.250
They relate to a more valuable
and meaningful kind of life

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:17.260
where a consciousness that
entertains past and future

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.920
apprehensive primal mysteries
of sexual generation

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.050
and the ultimate
mystery of death

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.720
and what may lie beyond death.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.140
These central concerns
about is the very reason

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.110
for the city's
existence, inseparable

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:37.960
from the economic substance
that makes it possible."

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:43.240
Another item from
Mumford talking

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:48.190
about the exaggerated
height and thickness

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:51.760
of walls in earlier cities.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.410
The wall of Khorsabad
which is an Assyrian town,

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.790
the fourth capital city
of the Kingdom of Assyria,

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.330
built around 700 BC--

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.270
the walls are 75 feet thick.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:13.840
There is no possibility that
you build 75 feet thick walls

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.380
for military purposes.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.110
In Mumford's term, it
is only for the gods

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:24.250
that men exert themselves
so extravagantly.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.390
It's a wonderful phrase.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.980
Remember it, never forget it.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.540
It's only for the
gods that men, if you

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.600
wish to enlarge
the notion of gods,

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:40.690
and I'll discussed the notion
of a god gene a bit later.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:49.000
What we do is not only based on
simple postulates of function.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:11:00.490
It's central to
architecture as a discipline

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:04.930
that it's only for
gods that men exerts

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.570
themselves so extensively.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:13.760
Quoting from another source,
"every feature of the city

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.040
reveals the belief that man was
created for no other purpose

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.190
than to magnify
and serve his gods.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:26.738
That was the city's
ultimate reason for being."

00:11:26.738 --> 00:11:30.610
Now here you have
two postulates.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.960
You have to survive,
you're at the birth

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:42.550
of an instrument, a city, which
both has to deal with-- so

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:46.420
your survival possibility.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.000
You look to the stars.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.640
The stars are permanent.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.280
It's not really difficult
to erect a vertical stick,

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.840
a gnomon, in Mesopotamia.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:08.890
And at noon, the stick will
cast a shadow to the north.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.210
You'll be able to build
a compass around that.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:15.170
At the same time
it's doing that,

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:23.110
you will wonder why the town of
Chang'an in 190 BC in China is

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:27.400
built according to the
stars of the Dipper.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.290
I will show you a
slide of that plan.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.160
It's one of the
remarkable plans.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:42.970
So the stability of astronomy
in the earliest cycles of cities

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:50.110
and the creation of a deity
significance in relation

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:54.580
to each of these acts, it's one
thing to know where north is.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.520
It's another thing to
build your city according

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.170
to the primary
objectives of religion.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:06.990
We'll go on a little, but
picking up little aspect

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.540
to this.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.430
Most of the
significant buildings

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:20.290
built in archaic times
involve enormous amounts

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.200
of human labor.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.350
For the Pyramid of
Cheops, which has nothing

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.040
to do with function whatsoever.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.180
It has nothing to
do with materialism.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:35.140
It is in fact such an
exhaustion of materialism.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:45.400
The Pyramid of Cheops took
100,000 men 20 years to build.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.830
The Great Pyramid
of Cheops was built

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:54.310
with about 2,300,000 blocks
of stone, totaling about six

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.410
million tons in weight.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.550
They have blocks that average
two and 1/2 tons, but range up

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:04.960
to 15 tons, which
have to be quarried,

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.040
handled, and
transported up a river,

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.280
lifted 100 feet to
the level of the site

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.090
with sledges, rollers,
sleepers, ropes, and levers.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.780
You don't do that
for anything other

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:26.035
than the belief in
the post-secular life.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.620
Egypt didn't produce
any large cities

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:37.400
for various reasons, which we'll
talk about later in this class.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:47.560
But many argue that much of
the disposition of resources

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.720
consequently centered
on the building

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:55.295
of post-contemporary life.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:08.050
The most significant buildings
in most of these early cities

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:09.885
are religious buildings.

00:15:09.885 --> 00:15:14.080
They're generally built out
of compression structures.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:20.140
Solomon's Temple at
1000 BC in Jerusalem,

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:25.270
Herod's Temple, 70 years
before the birth of Christ--

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:28.960
both enormous
compression structures.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.450
Associated with these
compression structures,

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.600
which in generally can't
go up to more than 200

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.690
to 300 feet in height.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:43.450
The temples of Chichen Itza in
Mesoamerica-- about 200 feet.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:48.230
The Tower of Babel is
about 200 feet in height.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.680
The Tower of Babel has
the Temple of Marduk

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.720
on the top of the
Tower of Babel.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.440
All of this is
synchronous with the fact

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.670
that religion was interpreted
not by every person

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:08.430
but by gurus, by priests, people
who achieved enormous power,

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:12.750
but didn't distribute the
secrets of their power.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.870
The Holy of Holies
in Solomon's Temple

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:21.810
is still being sought for
by filmmakers and people who

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:25.710
want to excavate under the
Holy Mountain in Jerusalem.

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:31.485
Of course, something which is
prohibited by political forces.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:40.050
The origin of the mosque,
the church, and the synagogue

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:44.370
is later, in my view.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:54.990
The democracy of religion, which
we all know utilized, I think

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:58.380
comes in a different pattern.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:03.860
The first action that I
think in this direction

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.989
comes from the Jewish
exile in 700 BC.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.240
Nebuchadnezzar and
the Babylonian Army

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.660
destroys the first
Solomon's Temple.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:21.200
He takes the Jews
in exile to Babylon.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.579
Babylon is the greatest city
in the world at the time.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.950
The Jews don't abandon
their religion,

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.830
despite the fact that
they don't have a temple

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:34.940
and they don't have priests.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.900
They start praying
in schools, in homes.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:44.150
Ezekiel appears as part of--

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.880
how many chapters of
Ezekiel are in the beginning

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.280
of the Old Testament?

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.540
A whole bunch of them.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.400
What are they about?

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:58.040
They are all about
measurements of a temple.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.140
These measurements
have been interpreted

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.200
in all kinds of ways over time.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.070
The fact is that when the Jews
were released from Babylon

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:10.490
in exile, they
returned to Jerusalem

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:15.270
and Israel read the Bible to
the people for the first time.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:18.230
Later on, I think one of
the conflicts about Jesus,

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:21.560
in my view-- and I will go
into this in more detail

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.120
in the story of Jerusalem--

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:31.250
is the fact that the synagogue
and the democratic religion

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:35.270
was growing in power
under the Pharisees

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:40.760
and that Herod's Temple
was the last resort

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.910
of the power of the priests.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:49.250
And Jesus was a
confrontation to the priests,

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:54.290
to the Jewish priests,
who are on the way out.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:19:04.000
And his death was the mark of
the transition in Christianity

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.890
from, well, the birth of
Christianity to the church--

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:13.990
and later on, 700 years
later, to the mosque.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:18.010
So we have an image of
the pre-democratic church

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:21.700
environment as buildings
of compression,

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.720
no penetration of the
building by the people,

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.600
the slaughtering of animals.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.020
At Solomon's Temple, I
think 200,000 animals

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.390
were slaughtered, or 20,000.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.180
It doesn't matter.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.970
It's just a number.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:45.690
The giving a gift at
the birth of a ritual

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:48.590
is also part of that
same phenomenon.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.170
Many of these
priestly directions

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:58.100
still occur in some ways
in contemporary religion.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:04.370
Anyway, so we have
an image of a town

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:09.080
as a pristine object
which changes very

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.570
regularly and under control.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:16.190
It doesn't change sporadically,
it stays the same.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:20.525
Population growth is very
low, death rates are high.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:27.980
Population growth rates in
medieval Europe due to disease

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.320
was something like
0.6% per annum.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.990
So the idea that things change
very radically and very rapidly

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.210
is a very contemporary idea.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:41.510
You could build a city in
which everything roughly was

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.070
the same.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:45.920
And the routines for
understanding it and managing

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.860
it are also more
or less the same.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:55.460
This kind of city is a
mental force in itself.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:59.000
It accumulates the
understanding of it,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.265
it's perpetuated
through rituals.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:09.650
Rituals, according to
Mircea Eliade, E-L-I-A-D-E,

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:15.800
a Romanian religious philosopher
whom I will quote for in a few

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:20.840
minutes, these
are distinct-- oh,

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.580
let's wait until we get there.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:33.440
Human life is thereby given
a secure and permanent place.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.090
The gods [INAUDIBLE]
is kept often,

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.215
not incidentally, the
structure of human power,

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:44.600
of priests and kings, and
abilities is also maintained.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:58.750
Let's listen to Eliade's
depiction of archaic man.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:02.350
"If we observe the general
behavior of archaic man,

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.020
we are struck by
the following fact--

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.570
neither the objects
of the external world

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.420
nor human act,
properly speaking,

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.780
have any autonomous
intrinsic value.

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:20.880
Objects or acts acquire
the significance

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.270
and become real
because they reenact

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:29.160
after one fashion or another a
reality that transcends them."

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.650
This is difficult
stuff to understand.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:36.510
"Amongst my countless stones,
one stone becomes sacred,

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:40.410
and then instantly becomes
saturated with being.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:44.760
It becomes reality as opposed
to an everyday reality.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:51.750
It constitutes a hierophany
H-I-E-R-O-P-H-N-E-Y,

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:55.900
because it commemorates a
mythical act, and so on.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.700
The object appears as the
receptacle of an external force

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:06.920
to differentiate it from
the crude product of nature.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.620
The object fashioned
by the industry of man

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.560
acquire the reality,
the identity,

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.310
only to the extent of
their participation

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:20.360
in a transcendent reality."

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.170
In relation to the
form of cities,

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:28.080
Eliade talks about three things.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.350
Reality is a function
of the imitation

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.990
of a celestial archetype.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.300
I mentioned before.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.250
Number 2, the symbolism
of the center.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:46.710
Why a center?

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:52.410
The word Babylon means the
conjunction of the heaven

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:55.710
and earth and the subterranean.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:01.290
Jerusalem is known for its
being a city on the ground.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:07.080
In Christianic terms, there's
a city 15 miles above.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:13.620
Raphael paints a wonderful
picture of the earthly city,

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.380
heavenly city.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:22.530
Pope Urban II in 1080 in talking
to the Crusades in Europe

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:26.580
before they set off
for Jerusalem talks

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:33.660
to them about taking the earthly
city and the heavenly city.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:38.320
The invention of heaven
is a human invention.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:50.280
The Hebrews, the Jews didn't in
early accept the idea of a life

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:56.340
beyond the normal daily
experience of life.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:01.110
The center is not
only the position

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:05.490
of maximum concentration,
it is the position

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:10.020
of maximum identification.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:16.680
It's described in many of
these terms in cosmic terms

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.620
not only as a functional
economic center, but as

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:24.390
the central place which
distinguishes itself

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.670
from other place.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:32.460
In Eliade's terms, there's a
difference between the sacred

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.380
and the profane.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:38.190
The profane is the
everyday world.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:44.040
Reverse it, our secular world
is not in our terms profane.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:48.810
But in archaic times, he argues,
the secular world is profane.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:53.130
The religious world,
the only world,

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:57.510
purposely created through
hierophany of significance.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:09.070
Eliade argues that the third
impact on the form of towns

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:13.210
were rituals,
significant gestures

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:17.500
to acquire meaning
attributed to them.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:22.990
I might not have time to go into
these examples in China, India,

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:24.670
and Mesoamerica.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:30.250
But in the town of
Madurai in Southern India,

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:34.960
I will show you a slide of the
ritual still practiced today

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.980
of each cycle of
time as time passes.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:44.230
According to Eliade, progress
does not seen in terms of time

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:46.060
by archaic man.

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.350
Time was not linear--

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.070
time was circular.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:54.020
There's no notion
about the past.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.520
The present, the existence
of important things

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:04.270
is very much in association
with the security

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:05.740
that you give to everything.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:10.880
I'm just conscious
of time so I'm

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.240
going to go through,
skip some of this stuff

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.080
and try to concentrate
on a few of the items.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.330
What I'd like to
do is in relation--

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:36.940
oh, I didn't tell you
what I handed out to you.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:37.690
I'm sorry.

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:48.970
This is an image of a town.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:49.830
Where is it?

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:58.860
It's a rather famous city.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.290
It's a classical city.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:02.860
It's Athens.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:11.030
The image shows Athens
is being built largely

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:21.470
around an elevated
system of space

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:26.840
called the Acropolis,
a religious god.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:38.180
And its extension to the water
around the town of Pireas,

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:43.380
the Harbor of Pireas,
depicts the implication

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:48.300
of building a town whose form
is much more mechanical and much

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.630
more of the kind that we
will talk about next Tuesday.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:57.900
We have two forms of the
same system, one dedicated.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:06.630
We know Pireas is purely a place
in conjunction with an expanded

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.630
view of the Mediterranean--

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:14.040
the Acropolis of Athens
plus the monuments of gods

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:14.925
all over Athens.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:24.240
Depicts a consciousness
of what we

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:29.430
might call the religious gene.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:33.870
The greatest gene is a
term taken from archaeology

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:36.150
relatively recently.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:42.120
And based on excavations
in the Mayan world, which

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:45.075
argues that belonging
to religions

00:29:45.075 --> 00:29:48.270
was a very, very early
phenomenon, largely

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:51.540
because of the security
the community gave--

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:56.340
belonging to the same thing
provided fundamental security.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:02.290
And the god gene, in a Darwinian
sense, is built into all of us.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:06.600
Those of us who
don't believe in god

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.140
are not part of
the Darwinian bet--

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:15.780
we are creatures of obstinance--

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.240
and since the
Enlightenment have been

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.350
free to criticize
whatever we want to based

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:25.230
on fact or on mythology.

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:27.750
I'm going to go
through the components

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.970
of a theory on the second page.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:31.090
AUDIENCE: I have question.

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:32.300
JULIAN BEINART: Yes.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.280
AUDIENCE: Regarding the
layout of having both Athens

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.715
and Pireas at the same time.

00:30:36.715 --> 00:30:37.590
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:42.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] social
division between them?

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.480
And if so, what were
the different types

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.750
of social groups, like
division one versus the other?

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:54.940
JULIAN BEINART: Athens during
the fifth century, and only

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:59.740
for one century,
experimented with democracy.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.850
At that time, all citizens
were considered equal,

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:05.475
except for women or slaves.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.140
There's a machine in
the museum in Athens

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.580
which is almost like
a machine in which you

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.720
put in your fingerprint and
it registers you for voting.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:29.500
So in Democratic Athens,
as Socrates would explain,

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:34.330
all people were considered
equal in the first notion

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:36.310
of a crude democracy.

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:39.460
It didn't last very long.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:47.180
Athens is situated in rocky
country, very poor agriculture.

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:52.780
So it's dependent on other
sources of basic supply

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:57.610
of food, such as wheat.

00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:59.860
In later years, it
was so desperate

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:05.470
that it tried to attacked
Sicily, which has always been

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:09.220
a center of wheat production.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:15.160
So Pireas was part of the
extension of Athens for food.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:19.120
It was purely a
machine-like enterprise.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:24.100
It only had to produce
goods for the service

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:28.330
of the democratic capital,
which was experimenting

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:31.270
with all kinds of ways
of life, including

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:36.940
the purposeful
application of democracy.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:41.650
Within Athens, democratic
Athens itself, yes, there

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:44.350
were areas where
the more powerful

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:47.350
lived and there were areas
with the less powerful.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:50.590
Socrates himself used
to walk through Athens

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:52.390
on a daily basis.

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:54.700
It was small enough to do that.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.490
And he would go through
different neighborhoods,

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:59.740
according to his
own descriptions.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:02.020
Socrates never wrote, of course.

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:07.320
So it's all told by
Plato and other people.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.275
But that's the short
answer to a long question.

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:22.880
The history of Athens is an
interesting story in itself.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.090
And I hope we'll have
some chance in this class

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.570
to deal with it.

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.590
I'm not sure that I am
going to, but we'll try.

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:45.030
The other sheet is a plan of
Angkor Wat, 13th, 14th century

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:50.010
city in Cambodia,
which I want to use

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:55.320
as an illustration of the
conjunction between built

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:59.010
form associated with
religion, built form also

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:03.880
at the same time serving
practical purposes.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:10.860
The feng shui in China
faces houses to the south.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:16.320
You are the lady who knows
more about China than I do.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:21.179
Feng shui is a mystical
system for the selection

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:26.850
of the site for the
location of buildings

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:33.719
which, practically speaking,
faces in the right direction.

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:36.630
Feng shui would be
hopeless if it faced houses

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:41.550
towards the north in a climate
in the northern hemisphere.

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:46.739
The same with my description
of the Hindu structure

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:50.219
of Angkor Wat.

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:54.479
Let's look at some of these
components of a theory.

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:06.500
First of all, the
notion of returning.

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:14.730
If there is
discrimination in places

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:18.480
which have been struck by
hierophany and therefore

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:23.610
more significant, they would
be relatively few of them.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:28.020
And some would be given
particular mythological

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:35.220
significance, and the idea of
retaining would be significant.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.010
Mumford says, in the
history of cities

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.300
the magnet comes
before the container.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.780
It's an interesting
sentence to remember.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:49.200
Movement towards cities,
called urbanization

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:54.060
in contemporary times,
is a reenactment

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:59.550
of a ritual of movement
to special places--

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:04.110
in our case is now to
secular capital cities

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:06.375
or industrial cities
or economic cities.

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:15.080
I will show you a
slide of Olympia

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:19.670
in Greece, the birth
of the Olympic games,

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:26.090
held every four years from
776 BC, a place to which

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:30.140
we return in only four years.

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:35.000
The contemporary
Olympic games has also

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.300
maintained the cycle
of returning to a place

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:39.800
every four years.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:43.910
Hitler wanted the
Olympic games after '36

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:46.080
to be in Berlin forever.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.800
In fact, he and Speer
designed a stadium

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:52.280
which was so large that the
Olympic rules would have to be

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.925
changed to fit the stadium.

00:36:55.925 --> 00:36:59.330
But that was
Hitler's prominence.

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:03.710
Hitler also invented the idea
of carrying the Olympic flame,

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:09.140
which now becomes an
economic popular piece

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.240
of the Olympic games.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:15.710
776 Olympic site was
a religious site,

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:19.730
which priests walked around.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:24.500
Hitler, in trying to
manifest the assumption

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:29.390
of the meritocracy
of the Aryan race,

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:35.840
made special attempts to
link Germany under Hitler

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:39.870
with Greece, with
the Athenian culture.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:43.160
A lot of archaeology
was sponsored

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:48.800
by German researchers.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:55.370
Hitler wished to combine the
permanence and the predominance

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:57.620
of the Aryan race.

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:03.680
So he took the idea of
taking the flame from 776,

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.880
the site of 776
BC, and taking it

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.150
to that point of the earth
where the games would

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:14.130
be held there four years.

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:17.960
There's no other significance
to the carrying of the flame.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.830
There was no flame carried in
the original Olympic games.

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:26.450
It's only a creation of
a manic manifestation

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:30.230
of racial supremacy.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:35.950
But there are places in the
world which still venerate

00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:39.610
the idea of pilgrimage,
which is still

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:43.630
a fundamental source
in Islam for returning

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:51.730
to Mecca each year, places
like Varanasi and Fatima

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:55.000
in Portugal, places that
have been sanctified

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.260
in some way or other.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:05.170
Pilgrimage-- I'll deal with
pilgrimage in another class.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:08.930
Pilgrimage is a very
interesting function

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:13.330
of lateral movement
between cities

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:17.020
prior to the economic
significance of economic trade.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.839
Natural phenomena, number 2.

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:34.190
Angkor Wat had a population
of, some people argue,

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:37.070
as large as a million
people in the 14th century.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:42.170
I don't believe it, but
there is no way of knowing.

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:45.980
It's significance in size
was based on the fact

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:51.470
that it had enough water to
produce more than one crop

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:53.120
of rice per year.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:57.620
Sometimes with that
amount of water,

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:01.210
you could produce three
crops of rice per year,

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:05.660
therefore feed an
enormous population.

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:11.120
The plan of Angkor has
two large water systems--

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:17.150
two are called baray, B-A-R-A-Y.
The west baray is about 7

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:19.670
kilometers in length.

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:23.780
The east baray, about 5.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.930
These are large bodies of water.

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:29.750
They are precisely enclosed.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:34.990
The deviation of the
rectangular geometry

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:39.330
is something like 0.01% error.

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:43.850
They are perfectly
constructed water bodies.

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:46.040
Between the water are towers.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.350
In religious terms,
in Hindu terms,

00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:02.570
the towers stand for
the peaks of Mount Meru,

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:06.170
between which are seven
oceans and six continents,

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:08.690
with Meru in the center.

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:10.985
The lakes are the
depictions of oceans.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:21.380
When I visited Angkor
for the first time,

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.560
my guide said to me
that there was no water

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:28.880
outlet from these two
baray water systems

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:33.450
to an external water source.

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:37.970
There's a large 87
kilometer lake a number

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:43.040
of kilometers away from Angkor,
but these are religious items,

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.700
these water bodies, but they
have no practical significance.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:49.490
Recent archaeology
has established

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:56.420
that there's a big water supply
system from Angkor to Lake

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:59.780
Tonle Sap, I think it is.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.340
So here you have
the ambivalence--

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:08.990
the city in creating an
ambivalence of symbolism.

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:15.500
It works symbolically and
also works practically.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.560
Whoever you are, you can
associate the significance

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.600
with symbolism.

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.550
It's a kind of curious
democracy that you

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:25.820
can choose which system
you want to believe

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:30.980
for the genuine
authority for your town.

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:36.170
We give everybody the chance,
if they have any kind of--

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:38.900
forget about
contemporary analogies.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.976
I don't want to make
contemporary analogies.

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:54.580
Another aspect of
significance in [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:59.050
we talk about archaic
times is that one

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:01.630
of the reasons we don't know
about the origin of language

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:04.750
because there is nothing about
language that is fossilized.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:11.350
Much of our knowledge of
what I'm talking about

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:13.960
is based on fossilization.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:19.690
And stone fossilizes
much longer than wood.

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:23.810
The empty space where the king
of Angkor Wat or the emperor

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:28.510
of Angkor Wat sat
is now a blank space

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:32.035
because wood is deteriorated
faster than stone.

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:47.610
Measuring the stars--
all the Babylonian cities

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:53.580
had the archive in the
[INAUDIBLE] system.

00:43:53.580 --> 00:44:00.150
The City of [INAUDIBLE] was
marked after the Cancer.

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:04.860
The city of Nineveh was
marked after Ursa Major.

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.696
The City of Assur--

00:44:06.696 --> 00:44:07.410
after Arcturus.

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.230
I've already
mentioned the creation

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:15.350
of the City of
Celestials, Jerusalem,

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:17.990
was created by God
before the city was

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:19.610
built by the hand of man.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:28.190
St. Augustine found three
versions of Jerusalem,

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:31.220
sometimes referring to
the earthly Jerusalem,

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:37.160
sometimes to the heavenly,
sometimes to both at once.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:41.490
St. John-- forget
about St. John.

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:44.510
He had an extraordinary--
his size of Jerusalem

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:47.750
was about 1,500 miles
long, about half

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:50.960
the area of the
United States, so much

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.030
for believing the disciples.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.410
There's a book
called The History

00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:59.750
of Heaven, which is an
interesting bit of little book.

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:09.590
He discusses how contrived the
notion of heaven actually is

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:15.950
and how as far as the
money is his religion

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:21.230
became stronger as Christianity
took over from Judaism

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:24.920
and Islam took over
from Christianity, Islam

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:33.410
occurs a millennium, 700
years after Christianity.

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:35.780
The Koran has much
more attention

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:40.250
paid to it to
ecclesiastical circumstances

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:43.220
to post-living circumstances.

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.970
You could almost understand in
the Koran is when I read it,

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:50.420
how joyous it would be
to be in the afterlife

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:53.210
then in secular life.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:57.410
This notion of
privileging the afterlife

00:45:57.410 --> 00:46:00.590
is of course criticized
by Marx as one

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:03.880
of these many
critiques of religion,

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:10.760
that it is nothing natural
about making humankind suffer

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:15.800
through the abuses
of mankind in return

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.655
for which you have promised
ecclesiastical benefit.

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:28.546
Just want to rush through
these so we have time.

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:37.845
Fixing places.

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:46.340
In the feng shui system,
there are ways in which

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:49.460
you can find a site for a town.

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:53.240
The tradition of
divining, dousing,

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:58.370
geomancy, astrobiology,
were all primitive methods,

00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:03.470
if you want to call them
pseudosciences for determining

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:05.690
a place.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:09.890
A place is not to be taken
by a developer as a site

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:11.990
for an old age community.

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:19.890
A place is one which has sacred
significance in this model.

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:25.430
The center of the
Earth, the Axis Mundi,

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:31.190
is the center of
all the centers.

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:37.610
It is an accommodation
of the cosmic model.

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:47.300
In the Jewish religion, the
Temple Mount in Jerusalem

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:54.500
is the site of Adam, and each of
the site of Abraham and Isaac's

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:59.000
offering to God and
God's willingness

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.085
to stop Abraham
sacrificing Isaac.

00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:10.700
All of this is sedimented
into the Jewish religion.

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:14.600
The Temple Mount--
both Solomon's Temple

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:18.530
and Herod's Temple are
built on the Temple Mount,

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:24.110
making this the center not only
of Judaism but of the world.

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:28.170
And Judaism was arrogant enough
that until the birth of Christ

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:29.630
it was the center of the world.

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:36.730
Christianity, for
reasons which I'll

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:39.460
go into in the
history of Jerusalem,

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:43.240
in the case study of
Jerusalem, didn't abide by.

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:49.600
For 500 years, the Temple Mount
was a dump of Roman ruins.

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:52.690
The Church of the
Holy Sepulcher was

00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:55.840
built to turn away
from the Temple Mount.

00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:01.900
When the first members of
Islam came into Jerusalem,

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.360
and they wanted
to choose the site

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.370
for their own religious place.

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:11.660
They chose the Temple Mount,
not the Christian sites.

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.570
The Christians finally turned--

00:49:16.552 --> 00:49:18.910
it's too much of a detail.

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:22.582
I'd have to draw it to
make it more sensible.

00:49:22.582 --> 00:49:25.879
AUDIENCE: Why did they
choose a Jewish site versus--

00:49:25.879 --> 00:49:27.190
JULIAN BEINART: Because they--

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:28.315
AUDIENCE: A Christian site?

00:49:28.315 --> 00:49:29.950
JULIAN BEINART:
Because they claim

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:34.570
to have many of the same
religious heritage, Abraham,

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:37.690
many of the religious gods.

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:41.780
Jerusalem was always considered
the second or third largest,

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:47.320
most significant in
the Fatiha literature,

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:50.260
which celebrates cities.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:53.410
Jerusalem, after
all, the mythology

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:59.350
of the ascent from the
Dome of the Rock to heaven

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:02.860
is important mythology in Islam.

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:06.100
The Dome of the Rock is one of
the most significant buildings

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:07.150
in Islam.

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:09.220
It's on the Temple Mount.

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:11.890
Al-Aqsa Mosque is
on the Temple Mount.

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:16.090
There's a continuity
of even violently

00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:21.560
different religious forms,
excepting Axis Mundi.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.670
There's an economy
of religious sites.

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:28.930
If you're not sure
about your god,

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:34.270
maybe the fact that the
previous god sanctified a place.

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:36.160
It's like buying
into a firm that's

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:41.170
had a good economic record,
even if you are in competition

00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:42.940
with the firm itself.

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:47.132
AUDIENCE: Were they expecting
a grid system by doing that?

00:50:47.132 --> 00:50:48.340
JULIAN BEINART: I don't know.

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:51.880
We'd have to get in when we do
the case study in Jerusalem.

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.850
And I can talk about
it in more detail.

00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:57.370
We can talk about--

00:50:57.370 --> 00:50:59.260
there's only one
place in Jerusalem

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:04.440
where all three religions
are represented vertically.

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:08.090
It's the Christian,
Islam, Jewish--

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:15.270
the Tomb of David, the Christian
Last Supper, and the Islam

00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:19.110
Ottoman Manifestation above it.

00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:21.720
I'll go into that with
diagrams and show.

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.480
How are we doing?

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.850
OK, we've got a
few more minutes.

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:34.940
Another aspect of
this kind of city

00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:36.850
is the definition of boundaries.

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:44.000
Boundaries and ritual
perambulation--

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:50.640
the celebration of the
Kingdom of Phnom Penh

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:55.200
involved people circulating
around the town.

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:59.580
Joshua and Jericho, a
circuit of the white walls

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:03.790
of Memphis for each new
coronation of a pharaoh.

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:06.780
A Jewish synagogue
where you perambulate

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.760
around the central--

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:12.270
not the Torah, but
the central locus

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:16.890
from where the prayer is
read is a perambulation.

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:20.550
Romulus in the circular
rampart traced by the plow

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:23.078
to ensure the safety of Rome.

00:52:27.958 --> 00:52:31.590
The Roman Mundus, the meeting
of the Earth and the lower

00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:32.090
regions.

00:52:36.247 --> 00:52:40.620
The Laws of the
Indies, which built

00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:45.450
much of Central America and
St. Augustine in Florida

00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:53.130
all the way to Los Angeles,
says that the settlement

00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:55.800
should have a stockade,
even though there

00:52:55.800 --> 00:53:01.570
is no fear of military
action from residents.

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:08.760
The idea of mocking away
your world begins and ends

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.600
is significant.

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.260
We have a problem
about cities now

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:17.250
which dribbled into
some other form, then

00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:23.640
what architects consider to
be the central site of a city.

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:26.580
The bimodal or the bi--

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:29.130
I don't know if it's exactly
bimodal, it's not bimodal.

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:39.810
It's the concept of having
more than one allegiance, which

00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:41.070
is baffling.

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:50.190
Cities are always, as
I quoted Marx, class,

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:53.370
cities presume any difference
between the country

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:58.620
and the city, that as
long as that mark was

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:03.900
clear and understood through
walls, everybody was happy.

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:07.680
Once the city expanded
beyond the walls,

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.230
we have been left in doubt.

00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:13.065
This model made no
place for doubt.

00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:25.400
[INAUDIBLE] the center is
circumvented by a form.

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:33.050
There's another pretty
curious example of this kind.

00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:37.430
In Dorset, in England,
there are stone mounds

00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:43.610
which, seen from the
air, form giant forms.

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:48.020
In southern Peru,
the Nazca lines

00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:53.390
are huge conglomerates
of huge spiders,

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:59.000
identical, these lines
up to 900 feet long.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.040
In Glastonbury, in
England, there's

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:05.840
a planispheric circle
10 miles in diameter.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:10.520
There's a Gemini figure
made up of field forms.

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:13.730
These unexplained
natural devices,

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:17.300
which must have in
some ways had to do

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:26.350
with a system of
cosmic identity.

00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:27.768
The geometry of the land.

00:55:30.383 --> 00:55:34.570
The Romans, despite
their great rationality,

00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:36.640
used the system
of augury to find

00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:39.130
the right place
in the countryside

00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:42.500
from which to
survey could begin.

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:48.820
They ended up with the Decumanus
Maximus being the east-west,

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:55.840
and the Cardo Maximus being
the north-south axis of a town.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:03.090
This directional cardinality
occurs in a number of places.

00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:10.470
The Kaaba is depicted with four
quarters and diagonal lines

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:13.920
running to the
corners northeast.

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:18.855
The Union Jack is a
flag of the same plan.

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:27.150
Not only does it symbolize
the center of the Axis Mundi,

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:32.070
but it depicts things, that
you get the quartier in France

00:56:32.070 --> 00:56:33.990
as a part of the city.

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:36.720
You get the notion
of the headquarters--

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:40.645
what is the headquarters?

00:56:40.645 --> 00:56:43.470
It's a Axis Mundi
in military terms.

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:53.980
I'm tempted to, in this
case, just do a drawing.

00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:09.340
This is an early symbolic
map of Mexico City.

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:12.490
The Aztec leader's
name is Tenoch.

00:57:18.830 --> 00:57:26.360
He's depicted as next to an
eagle landing on the water

00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:32.000
with four streams, of course,
suggesting a connection

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.040
outwards to the
rest of the world.

00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:43.620
I choose this as an example
of this kind of figure.

00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:48.870
I choose it for another
interesting silly reason.

00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:52.920
What is the name of the
first city in the Bible,

00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:56.935
the Christian-Jewish Bible?

00:57:56.935 --> 00:57:58.755
AUDIENCE: Enoch?

00:57:58.755 --> 00:58:01.616
JULIAN BEINART:
Why do you know it?

00:58:01.616 --> 00:58:06.657
AUDIENCE: It's Cain's son.

00:58:06.657 --> 00:58:07.490
JULIAN BEINART: Yes.

00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:11.425
AUDIENCE: And then it's that
name minus the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:58:11.425 --> 00:58:13.580
JULIAN BEINART: Why
do you think there's

00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:15.758
a conjunction in the name?

00:58:15.758 --> 00:58:18.545
AUDIENCE: I have no idea.

00:58:18.545 --> 00:58:20.670
JULIAN BEINART: I haven't
the faintest idea either.

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:27.605
The first city in the Bible
is curiously called Enoch.

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:34.895
What is Enoch?

00:58:34.895 --> 00:58:36.860
It's the name of Cain's son.

00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:43.640
Adam's Hut in Paradise,
Joseph Rykwert's book,

00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:47.570
presumes that paradise
was perfection.

00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:49.550
There was no need for shelter.

00:58:49.550 --> 00:58:53.120
There's no need for
architecture in paradise.

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:55.340
We have changed that
view, of course.

00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:59.570
Architecture is
important for everything.

00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:03.200
Cain is banished from paradise.

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:06.350
He's a murderer-- he
murders his brother.

00:59:06.350 --> 00:59:08.900
He forms the first
city, the first cities

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:11.210
of crooks, murderers.

00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:14.960
The first urban
community in the Bible

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:19.460
is a community of retrogrades,
of people who have

00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:22.040
been expelled from paradise.

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:28.400
The Christian view
of this is that there

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:34.040
must be something
extraordinary about the city

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:38.220
and goes into the question of
salvation, and so on and so on,

00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:41.450
which I don't understand.

00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:44.260
But Enoch is the
name of the town.

00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:46.220
The whole idea--
Kevin Lynch was always

00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:51.080
fascinated by the idea
of why people name towns

00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:53.850
after their children.

00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:56.750
And he had a kind of convoluted
theory, which I can't

00:59:56.750 --> 01:00:01.190
remember as to why that occurs.

01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:08.510
But here, Enoch
is the first city

01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:16.520
in the Judeo-Christian
enterprise, a city of evil,

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:21.100
although it's been
sanctified in other ways.

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:35.430
But this is
Tenochtitlan, having a

01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:40.330
assuming a similar
kind of reach out,

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:45.810
an Axis Mundi, where the most
important thing takes place,

01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:49.810
the eagle is a symbol of
some kind, in any case,

01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:51.830
the leader is next to the eagle.

01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:54.665
It lands on the water.

01:00:54.665 --> 01:00:57.240
The site is a lake.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.970
The cactus, for some
reason or other,

01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:06.923
is the permanent
prodigious natural form.

01:01:06.923 --> 01:01:08.340
Do you know anything
about cactus?

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:13.880
I never know to explain
the cactus, anyway.

01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:25.465
The second last of these items
is the consciousness of place.

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:32.860
I haven't got time to
go into this phenomenon

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:37.990
except to tell the
story of Levi-Strauss'

01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:41.590
telling in Tristes Tropiques.

01:01:41.590 --> 01:01:43.840
Levi-Strauss studies the Bororo.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:46.960
The Bororo are a
primitive group of people

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.580
in the Mato Grosso in Brazil.

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:54.150
Much like the Dogon
in Africa, they

01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:59.580
are a kind of naive people.

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:04.770
The Dogon do wonderful sculpture
and put their sculpture

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:10.110
often in places for posterity.

01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:21.880
Bororo is a system in which
the town or the village

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.400
is circular.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.930
Each place has a
particular identity.

01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:30.930
And what are called moieties.

01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:35.370
There's a belief systems
are related to the place

01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:36.210
that you occupy.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:45.840
When the Salesian missionaries
came to missionize the Bororo,

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:50.130
they replaced the
circular locations

01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:52.860
with rectangular constructions.

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:58.290
The Bororo lost not only
their sense of place,

01:02:58.290 --> 01:03:00.760
but their sense of identity.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:09.560
So responding to the existence,
the psychic existence,

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:13.310
was their position in place.

01:03:13.310 --> 01:03:20.860
We have elements of it today
in our religious life--

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:24.440
those of you who
have religious lives.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.100
The position of place in
front of the altar in relation

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:31.670
in front of the cross,
the carrying of the cross,

01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:32.240
and so on.

01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:48.780
There's a story in South African
history of the famous battle

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:52.620
between the Zulus and
the Afrikaners in Natal

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:58.600
in which the versions of
history are very different.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:01.440
The Zulus claim that
the white settlers

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:05.250
tried to get into the
women's quarters, which

01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:09.870
are highly separate identities
in a circular system.

01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:21.790
The Afrikaners claim that the
white people were attracted

01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:27.220
to the center of this
town and were then killed,

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:29.890
leading to the famous
Battle of Blood River,

01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:32.890
and so on and so on.

01:04:32.890 --> 01:04:35.870
Numerology, which
I won't go into,

01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:42.130
if you read the cosmology
of Chinese cities,

01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:44.530
we should have enough.

01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:52.390
The nine square system,
figures adding up vertically

01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:54.445
and horizontally
to the number 15.

01:04:57.210 --> 01:05:06.340
I'm throwing at you a lot of
little stories, fragments.

01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:14.665
There's no coherent overall text
on what I tried to describe.

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:22.640
As for what it means
today, it's up to you to--

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.700
or up to us to
make sense of this.

01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:28.890
We still have people
standing before judges.

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:34.100
We still have a
significant night.

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:38.540
Why build a Tower of
Babel 300 feet high?

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:44.540
Why built the
Temple of the Moon.

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:48.260
It's the Temple of the Moon.

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:54.350
In Tenochtitlan on the Street
of the Dead, to the same height

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:56.090
and put the priests on the top.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:03.620
There are many fragments of this
which make up an idea of a kind

01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:09.290
of city which is no longer
prevalent in our thing

01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:16.940
but still remains to the extent
when I said in our last class

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:22.550
that we cannot under Darwinian
science explain phenomenon such

01:06:22.550 --> 01:06:25.640
as consciousness or mind.

01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:31.700
Quoting from a
recent book called

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:39.350
Cosmos of Mind, which is a
critique of Darwinian science,

01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:42.110
"architects more than
planners, by and large,

01:06:42.110 --> 01:06:48.980
have a sense of the innate
importance of experience

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:53.870
and believe through working at
it and every day observation

01:06:53.870 --> 01:07:02.090
and studying things you can
approximate good solutions."

01:07:02.090 --> 01:07:07.160
Whether a street in
Fifth Avenue in Manhattan

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:11.060
has cosmic significance,
I don't know.

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:15.750
Whether the Macy's parade
adds to that significance

01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:18.470
I don't know.

01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:22.130
I certainly know that
the parade in Madurai

01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:25.430
is different from
the Macy's parade.

01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:29.840
This Macy's parade is
not a godly phenomenon--

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:32.360
it's the experience phenomenon.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:39.020
As we go on in this case,
I'll be fussing around

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:42.750
with this
epistemological problem.

01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:45.320
How much is assumed
in our construction

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:50.600
of the form of cities
in the rational system,

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.770
which we've learned
since the Enlightenment?

01:07:54.770 --> 01:08:02.240
To what extent do we
consciously or how much

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:06.470
do we attempt to
maintain an interest

01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:11.770
and extend in our explicit
interest in symbolic form?

01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:21.569
Symbolic form is
a powerful measure

01:08:21.569 --> 01:08:25.290
of the success of this
generation of cities.

01:08:25.290 --> 01:08:28.340
There's no question that
all the evidence suggests

01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:33.680
that our cities start with a
consciousness and expression

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:36.990
of religious form.

01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:40.160
There is the stories.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.380
You have to believe me--

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:43.744
no reason to.

01:08:43.744 --> 01:08:44.929
Let's look at some pictures.

01:08:48.569 --> 01:08:52.130
This is Kevin Lynch's
depiction of the sites

01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:54.920
of cities that
we're talking about,

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:59.960
Mesoamerica around
about 1100 BC,

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:11.210
700 BC, Egypt, well, 3500 BC,
Jericho, 8000, Sumer, 4000,

01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:19.165
Indus, 2500, Shang
China about 1700 BC.

01:09:19.165 --> 01:09:19.665
Next.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:29.729
OK, this is a painting of
the town of Catalhuyuk,

01:09:29.729 --> 01:09:33.720
which Jane Jacobs
claims to have been

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:36.960
a center for the
production of obsidian

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:42.359
and used the agricultural
area around it as servicing

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:45.330
the industrial function.

01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:48.660
The curious thing about
another depiction,

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:52.470
which is on the other slide,
is that there is hardly

01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:55.350
any public space at all.

01:09:55.350 --> 01:10:01.290
These are obviously alleys from
one group of houses to another.

01:10:01.290 --> 01:10:02.050
Any questions?

01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:04.380
AUDIENCE: What's the
name of the [INAUDIBLE]??

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:06.000
JULIAN BEINART: Catalhuyuk--

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:12.700
C-A-T-A-L-H-U-Y-U-K.
It's in Anatolia.

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:18.060
I don't know whether
it's in Iraq or Turkey.

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:19.500
AUDIENCE: It's in Turkey.

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.390
JULIAN BEINART: It's in Turkey.

01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:23.845
Catalhuyuk is Turkish, isn't it.

01:10:23.845 --> 01:10:26.280
AUDIENCE: There is a book by
Bill Bryson called At Home

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.140
where he talks
about the ceilings

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:30.000
and how peculiar
are the entrances

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.160
and exits between buildings.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.660
How is that
reflected in the map?

01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:34.350
I'm trying to--

01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:36.250
JULIAN BEINART: I don't know.

01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:42.510
These maps, like the map
in just outside Oman,

01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:49.440
the first map of Jerusalem,
are very abstract depictions.

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:50.520
This is a wall painting.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.041
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:52.041 --> 01:10:57.360
JULIAN BEINART: And the
other one is an abstraction.

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:01.350
I would place very little
faith in the observations

01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:05.310
of these towns.

01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:08.570
Archaeology is
safer, and I don't

01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:11.550
know how much archaeological
investigation has

01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:13.445
been done at Catalhuyuk.

01:11:13.445 --> 01:11:15.734
AUDIENCE: That's why
he talks about double

01:11:15.734 --> 01:11:20.390
spaced in between and
a [INAUDIBLE] grid.

01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:23.130
JULIAN BEINART: I don't
think it's Jane Jacobs,

01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:25.600
but somebody has
spoken about the roofs

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:30.330
as being planes of utility.

01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:32.100
I don't think there's
much to be gained.

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:34.110
It looks like a
contemporary drawing

01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:36.670
for a squatter settlement.

01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:37.170
Next.

01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:44.430
Returning to particular place.

01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:48.360
Banaras is on the left,
Kaaba on the right--

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:54.935
an annual pilgrimage,
an every day pilgrimage.

01:11:54.935 --> 01:11:55.435
Next.

01:11:58.150 --> 01:12:05.600
Catalhuyuk-- the
notion that the water

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:15.190
is the replication of the
ocean and the vertical building

01:12:15.190 --> 01:12:19.465
the depiction of a mountain.

01:12:19.465 --> 01:12:22.990
Mircea Eliade often talks
about mountains and cities

01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:28.160
as being center in this
kind of cosmic model.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:28.660
Next.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.960
One of the reasons
for the towers

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:45.940
is because people
have no capacity

01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:49.705
to span any large distance, so
the distances are very small.

01:12:53.230 --> 01:12:58.520
Here is a parade of stone
figures on a sports field,

01:12:58.520 --> 01:12:59.740
where it's just behind this.

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:01.900
The royal palace
doesn't exist anymore

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.590
because it's built out of wood.

01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:04.090
Next.

01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:14.835
The phenomenon, and
this is Chichen Itza.

01:13:14.835 --> 01:13:15.335
Next.

01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:32.980
Chichen Itza, Masada, one
of Herod's vacation homes

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:36.400
built on the side of the hill.

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:41.650
Again, the notion of
building on top of something.

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:46.690
The Romans finally
conquered Masada

01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:51.905
by building a earth
bridge to the top.

01:13:51.905 --> 01:13:52.405
Next.

01:13:57.190 --> 01:13:59.800
A depiction of
the Babylon tower.

01:14:02.710 --> 01:14:05.080
Not a very good one.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:09.250
And the mixture of
astronomy and religion

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:13.420
in the case of Tenochtitlan.

01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:16.955
Equinox sunrise over
the Templo Mayor.

01:14:16.955 --> 01:14:17.455
Next.

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.795
Here's the city of the Dipper.

01:14:23.795 --> 01:14:27.980
The constellations Ursa Major
and Ursa Minor superimposed

01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:31.400
in the plan of Han
Dynasty, Chang'an.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:35.510
The popular belief of subsequent
generations that the city was

01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:37.790
consciously designed
to this pattern

01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:41.570
is unsupported by any
independent event,

01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:44.990
nor do the positions
of the imperial palaces

01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:51.320
coincide with that of the
pulse star, and so and so.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.680
There's some doubt about
this, but it's a nice drawing.

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:00.560
Next.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.030
The astronomical
observatory in Chichen Itza.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:21.050
A temple town in Southern India.

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:24.800
Now in each of these
vertical constructions

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:30.130
is not an astronomical
tower, but there's

01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:34.850
a regularity of the vertical
phenomenon throughout the town

01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:36.735
depicting something or other.

01:15:36.735 --> 01:15:37.235
Next.

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:46.330
a gnomon, a tool
used by the Romans

01:15:46.330 --> 01:15:49.480
for finding a propitious site.

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:54.040
And the geomancer's an
astrobiological instrument

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.530
for choosing the right site.

01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:58.030
Next.

01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:07.240
Chinchiri in Anatolia.

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:09.610
Interesting, the first town--

01:16:09.610 --> 01:16:14.470
settlement is fortified
with a wall that

01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:22.090
is small that surrounds the
town as intimately as possible.

01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:25.450
When the town is
economically successful,

01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:30.160
it builds itself in the
first century before Christ

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:33.370
a surrounding wall
which is based

01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:42.650
on a superior geometry, a
perfect geometry, a geometry

01:16:42.650 --> 01:16:48.020
which can be associated
with centrality,

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:53.450
with permanent symbolic
enclosure of high order

01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:54.650
and so on.

01:16:54.650 --> 01:16:57.830
Here the town of [INAUDIBLE]
in the 1st century BC.

01:17:01.610 --> 01:17:04.640
It used to be in the
south of the USSR--

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:07.730
I don't know where it is now--

01:17:07.730 --> 01:17:11.470
which has an
astronomical center.

01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:15.980
It has astronomical
observation site in the center.

01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:23.295
And the town follows the
pattern as it moves outwards.

01:17:23.295 --> 01:17:23.795
Next.

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:31.500
The town of Edfu on the Nile.

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:35.565
Peculiar.

01:17:35.565 --> 01:17:42.180
A marvelous conjunction
of light and shadow

01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:45.675
in the marking of
a special place.

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:51.600
Edfu is the town.

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.343
It's a small town on
the banks of the--

01:17:53.343 --> 01:17:54.260
AUDIENCE: Of the Nile.

01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:56.040
JULIAN BEINART: But
you have replications

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:59.970
of this in Luxor and
in Karnak and so on.

01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:08.580
I chose that one because I
happen to photograph it myself

01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:13.290
and I was still struck
by the conjunction

01:18:13.290 --> 01:18:16.740
of the positive light in
the form of the towers.

01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:24.520
Here's a typical
perfect Chinese town.

01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:31.200
The emperor is in
position number 1.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:37.230
The subsequent position's
in 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:41.310
But the town is symmetrically
divided between right and left.

01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:45.570
There's a color for the right,
there's a color for the left.

01:18:45.570 --> 01:18:49.080
This is a town which is
perfectly controlled.

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:52.320
And its form is
a pristine object

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:58.090
for depicting symbolic
security and actual security.

01:18:58.090 --> 01:18:58.590
Next.

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:09.130
Jerusalem is the head
of the three continents.

01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:12.600
The Temple Mount, which I will
describe in much greater detail

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:13.975
as we go on in this class.

01:19:13.975 --> 01:19:14.475
Next.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:22.760
Oh, here we've gone out again.

01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:32.680
Those are the formation seen
from the sky in Glastonbury

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:33.755
and Dorset.

01:19:33.755 --> 01:19:34.255
Next.

01:19:38.670 --> 01:19:43.540
The map of Mexico City and
the actual first settlement.

01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:44.040
Next.

01:19:49.635 --> 01:19:56.540
The moiety town of the
Bororo, the position

01:19:56.540 --> 01:20:01.370
of the clan system, and
moiety A and moiety B,

01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:04.800
specifying the
significance of place.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.580
Place is not arbitrary.

01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:10.810
Place is connected to
fundamental existence.

01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:17.120
And here in the
town in Cameroon we

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:23.630
have a similar disposition of
man, wife, man, man, man, man,

01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:27.800
man, man, wife, wife,
wife, and so on.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:29.540
Not to be mixed up.

01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:31.790
No cohabitation.

01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:32.290
Next.

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.430
The depiction of place.

01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:42.610
This is the Gate
of Heavenly Peace,

01:20:42.610 --> 01:20:48.940
the marker of the distinction
between the whole Heavenly

01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:59.650
City and the Sacred City, marked
here by a more recent emperor.

01:20:59.650 --> 01:21:05.450
And here are the
location of the Mausoleum

01:21:05.450 --> 01:21:11.710
to Mao on Tiananmen Square,
bereft of any disposition

01:21:11.710 --> 01:21:15.190
of location which
is fundamentally wed

01:21:15.190 --> 01:21:19.270
into the system of the town.

01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:21.490
It is anywhere.

01:21:21.490 --> 01:21:28.550
It looks as if it could be
anywhere, and it doesn't.

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:31.310
The strength of that
pattern on the left

01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:37.328
is infinitely larger
than the strength--

01:21:37.328 --> 01:21:41.360
the construction of
the right is not wed,

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:47.720
is not bred into the large
identity of the city.

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.010
Next.

01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:52.760
It could be anywhere.

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.860
Let's just pass this.

01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:57.310
This is a feng shui problem.

01:21:57.310 --> 01:21:59.930
Next.

01:21:59.930 --> 01:22:03.860
Depictions of the
system of approach

01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:09.560
to the central imperial
position in the city.

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:13.040
Here are the idea
of a set of boxes,

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:16.725
revealing more as you
go into the system.

01:22:16.725 --> 01:22:17.225
Next.

01:22:20.410 --> 01:22:25.270
The mandala, the central
premise of the Indian system.

01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:35.170
A depiction of the body
of the Brahma in a system

01:22:35.170 --> 01:22:38.860
of subdivision of land here.

01:22:45.878 --> 01:22:49.630
The Hindu religion
has a number of texts

01:22:49.630 --> 01:22:53.360
about this siting of place.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:56.590
The south Shilpa Shastras.

01:22:56.590 --> 01:23:02.140
Here you see some
depictions of the way

01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:07.925
in which the basic mandala
system can be demarcated.

01:23:07.925 --> 01:23:08.425
Next.

01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:17.140
Let's take one of them.

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:20.440
The village [INAUDIBLE] is
appropriate for retired life.

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:24.080
The village is one, two--
five parallel streets

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:25.000
from east to west.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.780
Can you imagine us
living in a system where

01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:31.870
we control the
environment so religiously

01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:34.690
that a developer
in Florida would

01:23:34.690 --> 01:23:40.135
be told to build a religious
center on this basis

01:23:40.135 --> 01:23:43.130
of a mandala construction.

01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:46.285
It's beyond our belief system.

01:23:46.285 --> 01:23:46.785
Next.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:50.595
Jaipur.

01:23:50.595 --> 01:23:51.095
Next.

01:23:53.870 --> 01:24:00.590
In Madurai the rituals
performed regularly

01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:07.980
throughout the year conforming
to the town's structure.

01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:13.160
So that when you are performing
a ritual, it is territorial--

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.260
you're passing
through territory.

01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:21.620
Number 2, it is reinforcing your
notion of the plan of the town.

01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:26.000
What do we do today to
reinforce your understanding

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.820
of the plan of Boston?

01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:31.130
It's unnecessary.

01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:35.270
Maybe if you're driving a car
and you move along the river,

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:39.140
there's some sensibility about
the movement from the suburb

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:41.690
to the center of the city.

01:24:41.690 --> 01:24:43.010
Next.

01:24:43.010 --> 01:24:44.270
The Street of the Dead.

01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:59.200
Here's the vacant geometry
of a typical settlement

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:02.840
in the Mayan world.

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:07.990
Apparent lack of
axial relationships,

01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:10.795
the so-called vacant
city because there's

01:25:10.795 --> 01:25:13.990
very little evidence
the way people lived.

01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:18.700
Again, what is left are
elements of stone construction,

01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:19.200
monument.

01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:25.095
I think that's the lot.

01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:35.150
On Tuesday, we will
look at some examples

01:25:35.150 --> 01:25:44.120
of a completely
different formal system,

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.850
one which is
open-ended, loose, not

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:49.235
regulated by a central force.

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:55.830
So, have a good weekend.
