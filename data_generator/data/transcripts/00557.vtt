00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:30.540
JULIAN BEINART: To describe
the spatial history of London

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:37.530
in 45 minutes is impossible.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.130
London has to be seen in the
light of a number of issues.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.680
It's the greatest
open city in history.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.980
I'm going to be interested
in the spatial development

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:04.560
of London from about 1750
onwards, the period which

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.150
we have demarcated as being
the advent of modernism.

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:17.995
Sit down.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.760
London was first occupied
by the Romans in 43 AD.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.630
And they stayed in
England until about 400

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.900
AD, a long period of time.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.685
London never built great walls.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.160
As I said in a previous
class, the walls in Europe

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:07.240
are widest on the east
and get distinctly less.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.030
Paris rebuilt the walls a
number of times, as late

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.350
as the 19th century.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.610
But the British, separated
from continental Europe,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.550
never invested a great deal
in protecting the city.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.560
The crossing of the River Thames
was towards the northeast--

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.890
that is, towards what is
now the city of London,

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.315
the business and most protected
original part of London.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.670
The period post [INAUDIBLE]
can be characterized

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.180
by the application
of the British

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.550
of a number of contested
arenas of social life

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.840
and economic life.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.660
Already in 1838, the
Chartist movement

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.820
agitated for the
Democratic use of the vote.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.190
The first labor
unions were starting

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.360
to be originated in
the early 19th century.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:29.840
Charged labor was
put out of business.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.680
The origins of public housing--

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.180
the state never built
housing for people

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.310
except if there had to be
housed under poverty conditions.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:52.460
Most of the cities
in pre-English Europe

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:59.330
relied on religious powers
and charity to house people.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.950
There was no notion that the
public had any responsibility

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.510
for housing the population.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.760
So at least amongst
the many innovations

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.890
that this period
endorses, one would

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.180
include the major,
major, major organization

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.530
of the state towards
environmental improvement,

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.070
taking care of
public sanitation,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:39.830
the origin of welfare, state
health, building bylaws,

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.390
the emergence of
women's rights, the laws

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:50.540
against racial discrimination,
and the emergence

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.860
of the first--

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:01.890
I would call the modern
city-planning organization

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:13.800
with London County Council,
1889 to 1965, the most dramatic

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.620
state organization to
organize the application

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.990
of spatial and
social principles.

00:05:28.576 --> 00:05:30.425
The London County Council--

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.790
one of the problems
about city planning

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.020
is that you need an organization
internal to the state

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.190
or to the city to maintain
the quality of work.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.600
Outside consultants are OK.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.340
Unlike architecture,
with outside consultants,

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.160
you can build a building.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.620
City planning is a
continuous process

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.180
of adjustment, management
of public wealth

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.940
and private wealth.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.350
And one of the biggest
problems of working

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.820
in many parts of the
world today, for me,

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:21.300
is to adjust the level
of work in relation

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.860
to the level of the
capacity of application.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.560
There's no point in using
advanced levels of spatial

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.870
control in a city which cannot
maintain its application

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.460
and adjustment.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:49.650
I'm just, at the moment, engaged
with the city of Abu Dhabi, who

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.930
wants some help making
a new strategic plan.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.770
They want to do it without
outside consultants.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.790
They want to do it through
their own internal labor force.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.900
The real question is whether
they're going to be able to.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.380
But that's an
ongoing discussion,

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.760
which I'm having with them.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:20.550
London had already
established an enormous number

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.320
of characteristics of a
cultured and open city.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.285
Shakespeare bought a
house in London in 1613.

00:07:30.285 --> 00:07:32.880
He paid for it
through the profits

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.800
he made on theater
audiences in central London.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.770
John Locke, in 1685--

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:53.710
1689, perhaps--
published a paper

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.300
arguing for the separation
of church and state.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.230
It was really towards the
end of the 17th century.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:11.530
London has maintained
itself as an open city.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:16.900
2.6 million of the current
population of London

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.540
are foreign-born.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.970
That's about 30% of the
population of London today

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.530
are foreign-born.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.640
I think that's roughly
equivalent to Los Angeles.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.970
I'm not sure about Los
Angeles, but forgive me.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.400
I'm just guessing.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.960
I should know, but I
don't know a great deal.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:50.860
I read from the New York Times,
March the 4th, 2012, writing

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.140
about London.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.270
Every month, some
young bureaucrat

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.460
in the Chinese
State Administration

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:02.920
of Foreign Exchange reaches
out to a trader in London

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:08.230
and buys or sells billions
worth of US treasury bonds.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:12.850
London is the world's
largest market for dollars.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.070
So if you think
about all the money

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:19.910
that's being paid by
the Chinese government,

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.280
it's paid to London.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:29.650
London has remained the
central economic site

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.050
for a great deal of the
international world.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.780
We thought, perhaps,
by looking at some

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:52.630
of the spatial attributes
from the two major disasters,

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:58.540
the fire of 1666 and the
plague epidemic of 1666--

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:07.270
no modern city has ever been
struck by two major disasters

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:11.830
so close to one another.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.320
The Fire of London
was the greatest fire

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.690
the world had ever seen.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:25.170
On the 1st of September,
1666, the wooden structures

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.880
close to the river,
to the docks,

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.120
exactly the same as
Chicago in the Chicago Fire

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.230
200 years later--

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.380
the mayor was
apparently unimpressed

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.030
when first called to the scene.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:48.330
He expostulated, pish, a
woman might piss this out.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.030
He woke up the next day
to find half the world

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.350
around him destroyed.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.220
The fire interested
us less than the fact

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.970
that five days after the
flames had been controlled,

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.070
a young professor
of anatomy called

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:11.760
Christopher Wren, not yet
widely known as an architect,

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.830
approached the king with a plan.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.170
The plan took no account
whatever of the medieval street

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:22.400
plan.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.920
He superimposed his
grandiose vision

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.370
of wide avenues radiating
in straight lines

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.390
from the Royal Exchange.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.340
On 13 September,
Charles II, the king,

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.120
issued a proclamation,
assuring the city that,

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.190
quote, "though
every man must not

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:45.340
be suffered to reap
whatever--" oh, I

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.980
don't want to read the quote.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.440
Essentially, Wren
assumed that you

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:56.290
could socialize land and
change the form of a city

00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:00.130
by imposing a new
spatial pattern on it.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.240
The king said no, in
England, we respect

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.640
the ownership of
private property,

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:12.820
even if it's of a small scale.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.580
And I will not
endorse a plan which

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.360
does not advocate the
maintenance of the rights

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.270
of my citizens to land.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.100
There was another plan by John
Evelyn, which I'll show you.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:36.560
Wren build an
enormous amount of--

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.820
in the post-fire era, he
built a number of churches.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:45.960
And many of them is still there.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.260
He, of course, built
St. Paul's Cathedral.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.620
His clients didn't
like it very much.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.740
In his latest,
1713, I think he was

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.740
begging them to pay his income.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.840
So much for Wren.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:14.210
The principle that
London would not

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.360
be subject to the
powers of the state

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.360
to change its
spatial pattern has

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.690
been central to the maintenance
of the form of London.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:30.410
London doesn't
have large avenues.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.480
It has one, perhaps.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.580
Oxford Street is the old Roman
road from the east to the west.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:42.320
It has no north-south road
except for Regent Street, which

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.330
we'll discuss a bit later.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.300
It is the imposition of
a particular situation.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:14:00.210
The second epidemic of
London was the plague.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:07.740
But before the plague,
London's River Thames

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:11.340
had an underclass of
people who made a living

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.403
out of the filth of this river.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.590
They were people
called bone pickers,

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.570
rag gatherers, pure finders,
dredgermen, mudlarks,

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:32.450
sewer hunters, dustmen, night
soil men, bunters, toshers,

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.790
shoremen.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:39.080
If they had all formed
themselves into a union,

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.540
this London
underclass would have

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:45.005
been the fifth-largest
agglomeration of people

00:14:45.005 --> 00:14:45.755
in all of England.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:59.520
The consequences of
the river's water

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.680
being as polluted
as it was was only

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:10.740
established through the genius
of a man called John Snow.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.960
Before that, the
outbreaks of cholera

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.760
were generally assumed to
be a condition of the air.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:22.570
The miasmic theory of
cholera was prevalent.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:25.830
London's Parliament had to
shut down one summer because

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:29.790
of the stench from the river.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:33.180
But John Snow-- you
must read The Ghost Map.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.790
Has anybody read the
book The Ghost Map?

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:38.070
Good for you.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:43.140
I'm really using London as an
example of the transformation

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:47.610
of a 19th-century city
under extraordinary level

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:50.610
of commitment and skill.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:16:01.290
Up till 1854, cholera was seen
as a disease borne by the air.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.250
There'd been many
attempts to make

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:12.340
the process of draining your
body a little more elegant.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.820
A water-flushing device
had been invented

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:20.500
in the late 16th century,
who installed a functioning

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.290
version for his godmother,
Queen Elizabeth.

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:27.400
The device didn't take on
until a watchmaker called

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:33.670
Albert Cummings
designed an improved

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.190
version of Herrington's design.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:42.940
At the Great Exhibition of 1851,
an estimated 827,000 visitors

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:43.630
used them.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:54.590
After that, the seated toilet
became much more common

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:55.610
in London.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.640
According to one estimate,
the average London household

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:05.089
used 160 gallons of
water a day in 1850.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:08.369
Thanks to the runaway
success of the water closet,

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:11.015
they were using 244
gallons per day.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.810
Snow transformed the
world of cholera.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:24.760
You have to read the book to
understand the Sherlock Holmes

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.560
genius with which this man
observed the situation, which

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:34.990
resulted in his finding
that cholera was carried

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:40.960
by a bacillus borne by water.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:46.570
All of the improvement
in the seated toilet seat

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:49.270
simply meant that
more and more feces

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.450
were being poured into cesspools
because there was no sewage

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:53.480
system.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:59.980
Imagine a city where there is
no sewage system, where there

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.970
are constant
outbreaks of cholera,

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:12.400
until one modest general
practitioner in the West End

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:17.650
comes up with the notion
that it's waterborne.

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:23.560
Such is the genius of British
endeavor at this time.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.780
It took only seven years.

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:33.960
Yeah.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.540
The most advanced and
elaborate sewage system

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:41.970
in the entire world was
largely operational by 1865.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:46.080
Joseph Bazalgette, the
engineer, in six years

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:51.060
had constructed nearly
82 miles of sewage

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.420
using over 300 million
bricks and nearly a million

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.800
cubic yards of concrete.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.350
The main--

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.540
All the sewage flowed
into the Thames,

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.350
which either remained
static or flowed,

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:33.275
eventually, out to the sea.

00:19:33.275 --> 00:19:44.620
Bazalgette built two in the
north and one in the south.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:51.300
This took all of the sewage
and water, wastewater,

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:58.370
and pumped or used elevation
to export it to the sea.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:08.160
Around central London, he built
two embankments, the Chelsea

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.980
and the Victoria embankment
on the north and the Albert

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.185
embankment on the south.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:19.590
This is one of the
biggest industrial feats

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.420
in human history.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.700
The extraordinary thing is
that if you're in London

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.730
and you walk on the embankment,
you don't know anything

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.710
about what it's doing.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:34.980
London advertises Big Ben
because you can see it.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:40.280
The underground of
cities is impalpable.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:47.780
This is an extraordinary example
of the genius, Sir Joseph

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.485
Paxton, who designed the
Crystal Palace, the Gardener.

00:20:51.485 --> 00:20:55.290
He said, we in Britain solve
problems by common sense

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.765
and technology, not bombast.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.980
I wonder what the American--

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:09.560
what a city like Boston would
build in six years, hardly

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.370
a sewage system.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:27.490
The next issue again
starts with a disaster.

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.130
We want to examine the
transformation of land

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.500
in central London.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.685
We start with a story.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:44.130
Alexander, the nephew
of Mr. Hugh Audley,

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:48.300
died in the plague.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.090
Mr. Audley was a
lawyer, a great leader.

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:55.440
He amassed a great legendary
wealth through dealings

00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:00.330
with a court of wards, the
court which apportioned

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:04.560
lands forfeited to the Crown
when the owner couldn't

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.020
pay the fees.

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:17.430
Among his property rights
which he accumulated

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:22.020
was the Manor of Ebury, which
was swamps and farmsteads which

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.980
ran from the Thames River as
far north as the old Roman

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.790
road to Bath, Oxford Street.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:34.230
So the West End of
London was a swamp.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:39.810
It accrued into the
hands of this family.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:43.740
Through a number of
generations, it passed down

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:47.280
to a woman called Mary Davis.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.320
Mary Davis had needed money.

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.505
She arranged a marriage
to Lord Berkeley.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.550
These were rural
establishments looking for land

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:05.940
in the center of the city.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.180
Lord Berkeley--
Mary was only seven.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:13.710
And their marriage arrangement
was made with the Berkeley's

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.450
10-year-old son.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:19.140
But there was no money.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:25.560
They couldn't raise an
additional 3,000 pounds.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.010
The next marriage deal was
with Sir Thomas Grosvenor

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.690
at the age of 21.

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.160
Mary-- now 12--

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.420
was married in 1677.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:41.280
Mary developed mental illness,
became a fanatic critic--

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.910
oh, Catholic, not a critic.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:49.740
Surely some mental slip
from Catholic to critic.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.060
They're selecting a pope.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.770
I suppose that's on my mind.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.650
Grosvenor died in 1700.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:02.520
Mary was swept off to Europe
by a Roman Catholic priest

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.440
called Father Fenwick.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.400
In Paris, Fenwick
drugged her, married her

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.445
to his elder brother,
Edward Fenwick.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:20.460
In 1703, a court resolved
Fenwick versus Grosvenor.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:24.780
The court favored
the Grosvenor family.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:29.220
His son, Sir Richard, began to
develop the states of Mayfair,

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.190
Belgravia, Pimlico.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:36.540
Mary's land plus the
Grosvenor's provincial estates

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:44.340
produced the largest fortune
in British hands, only second

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.205
to the royal family.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.820
You should really be able
to answer this question.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.500
Why are there no
railway stations

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.820
on the west side of London?

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.475
I've just told you the story.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.200
Crown, crown, crown-- you
can look at your diagram.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:51.560
The Grosvenor'
estates-- number five,

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.780
and these are number two--

00:25:53.780 --> 00:26:01.830
as a block of land
impeded the development

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:06.780
of any railroad on the west.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:11.790
London is encircled
by railroads,

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:15.075
four miles by
1-and-1/2-mile box.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.810
There's a subway line
which runs along this box.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.520
What's it called?

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.300
Who knows London?

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.640
Come on, you must know
something about the greatest

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.960
city in the world.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.540
You're studying
urbanism, aren't you?

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:40.300
It's like me talking about
a classic case of pneumonia,

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.670
and you don't know what the
causes of pneumonia are.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:46.135
The Circle Line.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:03.570
Paddington, Euston, St.
Pancras, King's Cross,

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:04.575
Farringdon Street--

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.140
I think that's the one--

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:15.070
all linked to the industrial
heartland of England--

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:22.810
Victoria, Charing
Cross, Waterloo.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:25.830
All link to South Africa, and
India, and the United States.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.130
Some of these stations
on here link to Europe.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:44.210
There are no
stations on this arc.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:46.520
Now you know why.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:51.500
The combination of land between
the Crown and the Westminster--

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:55.130
Duke of Westminster is
probably the highest ranking

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:57.890
in the British aristocracy.

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:00.680
The Grosvenors became
the Duke of Westminster.

00:28:05.175 --> 00:28:05.675
OK.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.672
I made my point.

00:28:11.672 --> 00:28:12.255
It's a battle.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:31.130
It also advances the
notion that the combination

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:35.570
of rural land and
urban land is required

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.090
to produce great wealth--

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:41.450
at least, at this time, it was.

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:44.300
Raymond Williams is correct
in his book The Country

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.090
and the City in making
the point that it

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:52.040
is a combination of
the two that produced

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.250
the shape of
contemporary England.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:17.530
The second land story
deals with the fact

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:25.900
that the center of London
consisted, to the most part,

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:30.730
of land occupied by aristocracy.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.080
Large portions of land--

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:39.100
the Bedfords, the Duke
of Bedford, for instance,

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.850
occupied large portions of land.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:47.080
What emerged as a result
of economic growth

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:52.210
was the emergence-- and Marx
makes a classical reference

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:55.735
to the emergence of the middle
class of the bourgeoisie.

00:29:55.735 --> 00:29:59.810
It has major economic factors.

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:02.440
So valuable did the
land become that it

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:07.780
had to be transformed into
sales to the middle class

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.900
or the upper-middle class.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:17.500
So each of these states was
subdivided systematically.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.570
Where was the first?

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:24.200
These subdivided estates
characteristically

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.500
have a residential--

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:32.980
or residential in nature, have a
central public, or semi-public,

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.620
or private square in the center.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.680
And this animates the
whole spatial pattern

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:45.270
of central London,
at least most of it

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:47.880
to the west of Regent Street.

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:59.170
This is the only
city in the world

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:02.380
which has used
residential construction

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.750
to build its center.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:08.710
The city was always
off to the east.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:14.710
This is land which was available
just through the subdivision

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:18.040
of property.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:27.640
Again, Rasmussen points out that
these subdivisions generally

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.100
were little towns in themselves.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.040
It was the manor house,
which faced north.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.490
There's sometimes more
than one manor house.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.100
The housing was
generally occupied

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.510
by one family per unit, as
opposed to the boulevard

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:53.050
house of Paris, where every
floor was a separate housing

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:54.310
entity--

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:56.740
which, again, is one
of the many reasons

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.850
why London is about one-third
of the density of Paris.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:04.150
The second has to do with the
transportation system, which

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:05.460
we'll talk about in a minute.

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:11.240
Why do you think the rest
of the world never followed

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:16.060
the British pattern
of subdividing land

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.160
in a systematic way for housing?

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:28.300
Stupid.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:39.310
Why didn't the British impose
a system residential spatial

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:47.170
organization as interesting
and as articulate

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:48.805
as the British did for London?

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.140
I don't know how to
answer the question.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:33:02.300
Ideas don't seem to spread
all that well, good ideas.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.200
And of course, there
are many problems

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:11.450
with the fact that you're
subdividing land only

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:13.370
for another class
of people who can

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:18.560
pay the economic rent
through the leasehold system

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.150
of the subdivided estates.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:30.800
The extraordinary notion
of using a building--

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:37.510
there are 151 residential
squares in western London,

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:47.810
77 between 1800 and 1850,
but starting in 1631

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:53.060
with one which is famous
for other reasons.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.610
Its name is Covent Garden.

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:57.230
Why is it called Covent Garden?

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.280
How do you know
nothing about London.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.320
You need, really,
to spend some time

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.420
in London learning about
how this great city got

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.420
to be put together.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:15.370
Henry VIII didn't
like Catholicism.

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:19.090
So he closed the convents.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:22.659
The convent which
became Covent Garden

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:27.560
was handed over to the
Bedford family, who employed

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.070
the great British architect.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:34.509
Who was the greatest British
architect in the 17th century?

00:34:34.509 --> 00:34:35.679
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:38.500
JULIAN BEINART: Hmm?

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.790
Inigo Jones.

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:42.489
Do you know the
name Inigo Jones?

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:44.115
You should know them
if you've studied

00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:45.699
the history of architecture.

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:47.289
Mind you, the history
of architecture

00:34:47.289 --> 00:34:51.790
is so badly taught that I'm
not surprised that nobody

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:54.190
knows the name of Inigo Jones.

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:57.340
Inigo Jones is an interesting
man in his own right.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.610
Historians have often
thought that the term

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:07.210
Inigo came from the
fact that he was Welsh.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:11.830
It turns out that recent history
has found that he actually

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.180
traveled to India.

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:17.500
And he was probably a
homosexual taken to India

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.470
by one of the aristocracy.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:26.200
And the drawings of
him done in India,

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.140
which make his life a little
more complex, and perhaps

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.820
a little more interesting.

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:42.340
Anyway, he built a church,
St. Martin's in the Field,

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:47.440
as the main component
of the square.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.840
The rest of the
square was empty.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.110
There was some residential
accommodation in arcades,

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.600
which Jones designed.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:03.880
But the center became a market,
became the famous market

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:08.080
and developed into Covent
Garden, which the great opera

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.850
house of Covent Garden--

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:12.550
I don't know if there's any
connection between an opera

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:16.120
house and an
agricultural market,

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.750
but the British seem to
do these strange things.

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:22.420
Perhaps the market
produced a number

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:28.000
of people who sang and
became an opera company--

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.085
so history's adjacency,
perhaps, produces.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:40.360
What more can I say other
than to look with you

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.850
at some of these subdivisions?

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:52.540
I've given you, in the
handout on the first page--

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:57.415
if I remember correctly--
the landholdings.

00:36:57.415 --> 00:36:58.165
Are they numbered?

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.640
Number five is the
Grosvenor land.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.685
And number two is the Crown.

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:28.020
On the diagram above that,
it's got a lot of stuff on it.

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.820
It's rather complicated.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:35.550
But essentially, starting
in 1631, Covent Garden,

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:42.000
you see a slow growth
of subdivisions

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.220
of these big estates.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.390
And with the--

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:58.400
Sir John Summerson was
called the great period

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:04.370
in London building,
from about 1730

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:07.445
to 1800-and-so, the
Georgian period.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:18.080
It's interesting
that these buildings,

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.420
these new residential
armatures to the squares,

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:26.095
were built according
to strict rules.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:39.130
One of the reasons for
the care for maintenance

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:44.950
of these subdivided
estates is not only

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:52.720
because the land was expensive
but because one of the changes

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:57.130
that the British land
policy adopted, switching

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:59.020
from freehold to leasehold.

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:05.890
Royal land could never be sold.

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:09.370
Freehold land was
given by the king

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:18.820
to a client who had served
the king or queen admirably.

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.490
No resolution of
that was possible

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:26.470
until Parliament, realizing
the economic advantages

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:31.000
of this land and the
emergence of an economic class

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.690
of private buyers, decided
to pass a revision which

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:42.100
is called leasehold, which
meant that you were allowed,

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:46.210
as a royal aristocrat, to
subdivide your land over

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:52.900
long and lease it to somebody
for a long period of time--

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.000
I mean, 90 years, 100 years.

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.640
Summerson, I think,
argues that in order

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.810
to maintain the quality
of the property,

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:08.500
attention had to be paid to
the design of the buildings

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.500
and the quality of
the maintenance.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:12.950
I'm not sure about that.

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:17.110
So it's a bit foggy as to
whether the leasehold system

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:21.895
doesn't automatically imply a
good maintenance of property.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:32.210
The diagram below, you
can see number two,

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:35.690
which is where Buckingham
Palace is now--

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:39.020
two stretching all
the way to the river,

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.180
two stretching up
to Regent's Park,

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:43.310
which we'll talk
about in a minute,

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:45.710
and number five
stretching roughly

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:49.760
from the river, very
close to number two,

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.180
all the way up to Oxford
Street, which is--

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:59.200
well, I don't know if it's
exactly Oxford Street,

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.560
but in the proximity
of Oxford Street.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:07.120
These diagrams show
the subdivision of two

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:07.780
of the estates.

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:16.380
The Matrix of Comparative
Orders argument

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:23.130
is from an MIT thesis which
argues that West London

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:27.804
suggests an intermediate order.

00:41:27.804 --> 00:41:31.800
A textural order, such as
Rome, Parma, Delhi, Paris,

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:35.850
and so on the left, and the
intermediate order of West

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:43.435
London, and monumental orders,
and the intermediate order

00:41:43.435 --> 00:41:46.150
of another kind
in Bath and so on.

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:49.040
You can read this and
work it out yourself.

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:04.790
Residential squares
generally had

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:08.780
gardens in the center space.

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:16.880
In first, gardens
were private gardens.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:20.630
You inserted in the center
of the residential space

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:24.920
a garden, which was gated.

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:29.180
This was a strange idea, to
insert in the public domain

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.300
a private-only use.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:41.900
The British never had
large gardens of their own.

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.730
So in some sense, it was
a formal substitution

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:51.061
of a private garden into
a communal private garden,

00:42:51.061 --> 00:42:53.080
a very interesting idea.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:56.620
Although, as time
passed, this idea passed,

00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:00.550
and the central
squares became public.

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:04.690
The later ones, the 18th
and 19th century ones

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:07.356
were public, generally.

00:43:07.356 --> 00:43:09.650
It's an extraordinarily
formal device.

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:14.200
So when we look at four examples
of the residential squares,

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.410
you'll see the subtle
ways in which all of them

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:20.330
try to play around
with certain ideas--

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:23.380
the use of the road,
the use of monument,

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:28.330
the garden, the position of
the manor house, and so on.

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:35.740
The Mews of London were
the servant quarters

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.390
of these great estates.

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:41.650
Do you know the
word mews, M-E-W-S?

00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:45.280
They're some of the most
expensive real estate in London

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.420
today.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.400
They were the servant quarters.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.268
It's only the wealthy
who can afford to live

00:43:50.268 --> 00:43:51.476
in previous servant quarters.

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:58.050
It's another rule which
you might remember.

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:02.040
If land becomes valuable
enough, small space,

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:07.650
which is allocated appropriately
to the workers, working class,

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:13.350
becomes wealthy enough to
become the sole propriety

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:14.805
of a wealthy family.

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:27.260
When we talk about
Paris on Thursday,

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:32.360
you'll see the use of the public
square in Paris, the Place

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:36.240
Royale, for instance, at the
beginning of the 17th century.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.350
Now-- then, later, renamed
the Place des Vosges--

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:49.160
was really the antecedent
of the Covent Garden plan.

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:53.060
The Covent Garden plan
had an empty center, which

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:55.550
was then occupied by a market.

00:44:55.550 --> 00:45:00.854
The Place Royale was the house--

00:45:00.854 --> 00:45:04.760
the residential environment
surrounding the Place Royale

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:11.090
was for the French aristocracy
and the royal court.

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:16.940
The French never followed
the residential subdivision

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:18.800
of the British pattern.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.130
And many people,
including Rasmussen--

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:24.980
London, the unique city--

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.880
have commented on the fact
that London has always

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:34.670
been a series of small
endeavors, short vistas.

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:37.310
There's no Main
Street in London.

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:40.220
There's no main
avenue in London.

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:42.740
There's no great
avenue connecting

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:47.780
major parts of the city, as was
the principle of subdivision

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:49.835
or spatial
organization in Paris.

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:56.490
In the early part
of the 19th century,

00:45:56.490 --> 00:46:04.710
the Prince Regent and a very
slick architect developer

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:09.920
called John Nash hatched a plan.

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:15.430
The Crown owned Regent's
Park to the north.

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:17.980
And there was some
notion that you

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:22.330
might be able to connect the
Crown land with the crown

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:23.665
land on the south.

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:33.990
It took the making of a new
street to enable to do that.

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:39.200
Here, you have a beginning
of the sensibility of Paris.

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:46.130
Louis Napoleon, who became
the French King and the patron

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:51.650
of Baron Haussmann
from 1848 to 1870,

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:53.840
was in London at the time.

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:57.410
He also spent time in Boston.

00:46:57.410 --> 00:47:00.590
Apparently, he made a drawing
of the future of London

00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:03.005
in one of the
restaurants in Boston.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:13.310
Regent Street has two
major qualities about it.

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:19.920
Number one, it was able to be
the only spatial feature which

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:24.620
was able to be made in
London despite the edict

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:29.930
that London property should
remain in the hands of whoever

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:33.230
owned it unless bought.

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:40.490
You needed four qualities
to build a new street.

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:42.980
You needed an individual
who had the energy

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:45.950
to push the scheme
through, a good route,

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:48.770
an act of Parliament, and
about a million pounds.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:56.810
The Prince Regent and Nash had
the authority and the money

00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:57.650
to do this.

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:06.040
The merchants of this street
is a phenomenon in itself.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.910
We will examine that a
bit later in the class,

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:13.540
referring to the writings of
David Friedman on this subject.

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:25.720
It was contrary to the principle
of land division in England.

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:33.310
And it was possible,
through the genius of Nash

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:35.500
and his anomalous energy--

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:41.330
and there's an interesting
aspect to this street.

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:46.500
If you look between Oxford
Street and Portland Place,

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:49.585
there is something
called All Souls' Church.

00:48:49.585 --> 00:48:52.570
Do you see it?

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:55.065
When you go to London, go and
look at All Souls' Church.

00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:59.870
It's a piece of
architecture which

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:02.270
indicates a fundamental
principle of urbanism.

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:25.530
You cannot buy the property
over here or over here.

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:30.030
In order to make a street
run straight through,

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:32.940
and you have to create a bypass.

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:37.050
You design a circus in
front of the church,

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:42.810
a circus being a spherical
space, an open space,

00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:51.360
in front of the church to
carry the flow of the road

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:55.110
through like this.

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:57.840
Do you understand the principle?

00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:02.820
It's not a cosmic
idea, but it's an idea.

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.910
There aren't many cosmic
ideas in urbanism.

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:08.070
They're not in England.

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:11.100
They are small ideas.

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:19.200
London is, according to
somebody whom I quote--

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.580
I don't remember his
name or her name--

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:25.940
London is a city
of small realities.

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:36.010
There's another significant
feature of Regent Street.

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:46.140
Between 1840 and
1916, a man called

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:49.770
Charles Booth worked in London.

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:54.240
He wrote a book called Life and
Labour of the People of London.

00:50:54.240 --> 00:51:01.110
It's 12 volumes, published
between 1891 and 1900.

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:02.310
What did Booth do?

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:09.780
He produced something
for the first time,

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:13.520
which if you know
something about urbanism,

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.040
would recognize immediately.

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.840
He made a map of poverty.

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:24.395
He made the first map
showing income on a plane.

00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:36.510
What-- Oxford Street.

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:58.100
Booth's map indicates that there
are more poor people living

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:02.090
on this side of Regent
Street than on this side.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.670
So what do you
use new roads for?

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:12.450
This is what Engels
observed in Manchester.

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:18.000
Roads can serve the purpose
of subdividing property.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.170
Land on this side is much less
valuable than on that side.

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:28.920
This is where, by the way, Snow
did his experiments on cholera.

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:39.830
So we learned a number of these
very little micro attributes

00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:45.110
of urbanism, small-scale things.

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:51.150
Major revenues on one side,
a major lack of revenue

00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:53.330
on another side.

00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:56.690
Regent Street is
carefully modulated

00:52:56.690 --> 00:53:01.520
as Moses's highways were
in relation to land values.

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.770
You can't build a
public road straight

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:05.540
through expensive property.

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:11.430
Roads can be deviated.

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:17.850
Sometimes they create spatial
avenues of the great charm

00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:20.550
by virtue of them
twisting around.

00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:25.650
But the basic motivation is
not aesthetic, it's economic.

00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:46.370
The other great--
have we got time?

00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:48.620
OK.

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:53.310
In the required
reading for this class,

00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:56.310
there was a piece which I
wrote about the instruments

00:53:56.310 --> 00:53:59.510
of application in
the 19th century.

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:06.840
I won't have time
to go through them.

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:11.410
The first is the invention
of the [INAUDIBLE] payment

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:15.370
amortized building loan.

00:54:15.370 --> 00:54:21.400
The second is the transformation
of the building union

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:25.540
and building guilds into a
permanent building society

00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:28.190
for the lending of money.

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:32.770
The third is the transformation
of a pre-industrial guild

00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:39.280
of builders into a 19th-century
organization started by Thomas

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.795
Cubitt at the age of 27.

00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:48.460
He employed a permanent,
year-long labor

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:53.230
force as opposed to
day-long laborers

00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:56.540
provided by guild workers.

00:54:56.540 --> 00:55:02.740
He also could assume
economic risks

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:05.050
and forecast the
value of property.

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:12.630
He established what is
called the contracting gross.

00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:17.730
In times of such enormous,
fluctuating economy,

00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:20.880
it's difficult for
a large investor

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.370
to predict the cost of
what he would have to pay

00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:26.010
at the end of the project.

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:31.140
Cubitt revolutionized this by
inventing the contracting gross

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:35.830
by saying to the queen, it
doesn't matter what happens.

00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:38.950
It's going to take 12 years
to finish this project,

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:43.620
you have to pay $300 million
pounds at the end of 12 years.

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.150
This is before--

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:48.930
I mean, this is in a
time of economics--

00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:51.120
well, economics is
a modern science.

00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:54.360
It only dates, probably,
from about 1900.

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:59.280
So we have Ricardo, and Marx,
and people like that, Malthus,

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:01.046
who weren't much help in--

00:56:01.046 --> 00:56:04.770
but Cubitt understood that
the profits he could make

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:06.870
by maintaining a labor force--

00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:12.750
again, we have Marx's
notion of surplus value.

00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:22.620
By having 1,000 workers, you
reap a share of the income.

00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:25.320
And therefore, you
become very wealthy--

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.800
according to Marx, anyway.

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:30.660
And when you are
very wealthy, you

00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:34.350
can take economic risks
because you know what

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:37.740
you can produce at what cost.

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:48.880
I've mentioned the
transformation from freehold

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.110
to leasehold.

00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:56.770
The last of these
policy implications

00:56:56.770 --> 00:57:02.090
is the introduction or
invention of deficit spending,

00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:06.910
which I'll elaborate on more
when we talk about Paris.

00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:19.190
Paris was the first to assume
that the right of the state

00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:27.890
to private land was great,
was large, significant only

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:36.290
to be exceptionally
reversed by private owners.

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:41.480
Haussmann's property
development schemes

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:46.070
were schemes based on the
notion of deficit spending,

00:57:46.070 --> 00:57:52.010
that the state could engage
in large amounts of capital

00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:55.160
deficit on the
grounds that it was

00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:59.030
improving the economic
condition of the site.

00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:03.680
And the site would,
over time, pay back.

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:06.650
The fact that Haussmann's
borrowings only

00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:12.350
was paid back in 1928, some
75 years after Haussmann

00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:16.760
spent the money, is
something we'll debate

00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:20.420
in next Thursday's class.

00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:23.334
Let's look very quickly at
the idea of the railroad.

00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:36.820
London was the first to
introduce a train system

00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:41.770
into the compact center
of a city as urbanism.

00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:53.460
1863, the first subway ran
from on the north eastwards,

00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:58.410
from Paddington Station
past all of those stations,

00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:04.980
to the last one on the
bend, Farringdon Street.

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:13.590
These were [INAUDIBLE]
conditions.

00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:17.450
It was only a small
indentation in the Earth.

00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:21.140
And the train ran
without any ventilation,

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.335
except from the sky.

00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:27.260
It was enormously successful.

00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:34.040
There were millions--
it ran from 1873 to 1890

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:37.340
regularly at
10-minute intervals.

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:41.720
And I think it carried
something like a million or 10

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:44.990
million people regularly.

00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:50.360
In 1890, the deep, old tunnel
was reintroduced largely

00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:56.000
by an American
financier, Mr. Sprague.

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:03.710
And that set the pattern for the
building of a complete subway

01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:10.490
system, almost complete in 1900.

01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:12.560
I saw an estimate
of what it would

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.860
cost for a contemporary city
to build this, the London

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:17.540
Underground system.

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:22.310
And there's not enough money,
not enough capital in the world

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:23.680
to pay for it.

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.430
Of course, that's
an exaggeration.

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:27.230
There is enough capital.

01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:32.810
But it's beyond the
reach of any living city.

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:37.250
The British were very clever in
investing in the sewage system

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:40.310
and in the public
transportation system.

01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:46.160
They coupled the
inner circumstances,

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:51.950
with various colored lines,
with the suburban system,

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:55.790
which connected to the
outside, as yet relatively

01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:58.865
unbuilt villages and towns.

01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:07.420
There's a lot of details to be
discussed around the building

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.370
of the subway systems.

01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:11.920
There was enormous
costs involved

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.810
in getting some
of these stations.

01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:20.560
For instance, one writer
suggested that he took--

01:01:24.935 --> 01:01:25.435
yeah.

01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:32.320
The London and
Birmingham railway,

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:35.890
from the Midlands to Lord
Southampton's Euston station--

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:43.160
the railroad failed to
persuade the bid for the estate

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.620
to allow it any further.

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:48.950
It took an army of
20,000 men to construct

01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:51.410
and was probably the
largest public work ever

01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:54.830
to be undertaken in the
whole history of man

01:01:54.830 --> 01:02:01.190
with the possible exception
of the Great Wall of China.

01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:04.850
Digging this underground
tunnel in order

01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:09.140
that Euston could get
to Marylebone high road

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:12.950
and be part of the
central combination--

01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:17.750
11 million passengers in
the first year, and so on.

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:24.350
To leave us time
to look at this,

01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:29.840
I'm going to shorten the last
part of this investigation.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:34.115
Let's simply say
one or two things.

01:02:39.350 --> 01:02:43.340
From the provision of
housing for the poorer

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:49.590
part of the population
to the state

01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:56.000
accepting some role, a
major role in its care,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.760
it was a variety of moves,
largely through charity

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.330
and philanthropy.

01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:06.320
There was the
Octavia Hill system.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.350
There was philanthropy for 5%.

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:11.510
Everybody assumed
that philanthropy

01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:14.450
had to provide a profit.

01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:18.500
There was the
Octavia Hill system.

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:23.330
There were arguments that
the poor needed resuscitation

01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:28.580
through avoiding alcohol,
through temperance

01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:32.240
associations, through
teaching the Octavia Hill

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.050
system to teaching them
how to behave properly,

01:03:36.050 --> 01:03:41.940
how to save money, how to be
proficient with their time--

01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:44.720
in fact, how to be
modern citizens.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:49.010
The British aristocracy
assumed that it

01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:53.960
could do for Engels's
Manchester just

01:03:53.960 --> 01:04:00.470
through its own generosity,
plus a 5% fee for Americans

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:06.320
who invested in some of these
philanthropic organizations.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:12.100
In 1889, the London County
Council was established.

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:18.110
The London County Council
became the first state or city

01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:23.850
organization for the planning
and maintenance of the built

01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:26.060
city.

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:27.320
It was remarkable.

01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:36.560
It employed the highest
level of professional skill

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:39.800
that it could find,
people who were

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.980
great architects
like James Stirling,

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:46.280
others worked for the
London County Council

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.030
before branching
off on their own.

01:04:50.030 --> 01:05:00.130
The standard of public housing
has not been challenged.

01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:02.950
In 1965, the London
County Council

01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:06.940
was abolished by
Margaret Thatcher

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:10.870
and became the
Greater London Council

01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:12.760
with a different position.

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:17.470
But the great years of
the London County Council,

01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:22.660
a very left-wing organization--

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:25.150
one of the architects
who worked--

01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:29.470
I remember flying
from the Far East

01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:33.700
with this gentleman, who was a
well-known architect in London,

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:37.720
who told me of his first
week working in London County

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:43.000
Council, of being taken to a
pub on the Friday afternoon

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.390
and asked whether he
was a socialist or not.

01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:51.370
And he had to pass the test by
answering a bunch of questions.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:03.050
Are there any questions about
this incredibly brief survey

01:06:03.050 --> 01:06:06.250
one of the world's great cities?

01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:09.700
I apologize for doing
it in the only way I

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.860
can think of doing
it, and that's

01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:13.750
to pick on some characteristics.

01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:20.020
There are some very
good books and London.

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.470
Landlords to London
is a good book.

01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:26.260
There are a number of
others for those of you

01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:30.260
who want to examine the
thing in greater detail.

01:06:35.685 --> 01:06:38.910
But let's discuss.

01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:42.300
We're talking about 1824, 1830.

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:45.050
Engels is writing a
book in Manchester.

01:06:47.615 --> 01:06:48.990
We're talking
about the Enclosure

01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:54.420
Acts, all of the penalties
imposed on the emergent working

01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:55.800
class.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:59.610
Slowly, the emergent
working class

01:06:59.610 --> 01:07:03.600
gains a foothold in
the British democracy

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.710
and sets off 100 years.

01:07:10.425 --> 01:07:14.820
And the 100 years produces
all of these things--

01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:21.560
the first railway train,
underground, the first building

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:26.570
bylaws, rescuing
and transforming

01:07:26.570 --> 01:07:31.910
a city from a completely
different environment,

01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:35.180
in some respects,
from the conditions

01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:39.890
that Engels expressed in the
condition of the working class.

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:45.700
There was no central state.

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:51.700
Well, there were many things
that the Soviet revolution

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:55.300
offered which the British
government didn't offer.

01:07:55.300 --> 01:08:01.150
But a completely
remarkable Renaissance--

01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:07.000
and that with, as I repeat,
only the killing of 11 or 13

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:13.480
citizens over 125
years, 123 years,

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:20.439
from Peterloo to Bloody
Sunday in Northern Ireland.

01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:22.060
I think it's a remarkable--

01:08:24.779 --> 01:08:29.210
it's a remarkable story for
those interested in the effects

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:36.484
that good action and technology
can take on urban form.

01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:44.960
Here's the Roman crossing
on the east towards what

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.569
became the city of London.

01:08:47.569 --> 01:08:51.740
Here, the minimal
fortifications.

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:54.710
The monastery's located
on the outside ring,

01:08:54.710 --> 01:09:01.130
close to the walls in
case there's some crisis.

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:07.784
The monastery can send its
people to maintain the wall.

01:09:07.784 --> 01:09:08.284
Next.

01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:17.950
The Fire, the devastation of
the eastern part of the city.

01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:25.090
[INAUDIBLE] plan on the
top, the diagonalization

01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:30.850
and the centralisation
of the Royal Exchange.

01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:35.590
Evelyn's scheme or [INAUDIBLE]
scheme, neither of which

01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:37.849
gained much mileage.

01:09:37.849 --> 01:09:38.349
Next.

01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:51.060
Five and two combined,
virtually, the west of London.

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:55.020
This is Mary Davis,
whom I spoke about.

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:58.000
I don't know who took
this picture of her.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:58.500
Next.

01:10:02.670 --> 01:10:11.800
This is the pattern of
estate subdivisions.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:14.820
And see the big gap on the left?

01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:17.610
It is the Crown Regent's Park.

01:10:17.610 --> 01:10:21.305
And the north is the crown.

01:10:21.305 --> 01:10:25.980
A figure ground pattern
of the west of London,

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:32.160
indicating the black squares
aerating this fabric.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.950
And the condition
of Regent's Park

01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:39.330
is drawing the line from
Regent's Park on the north

01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:42.750
Regent Street,
finding its way down

01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:46.500
to the crown
property on the west.

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.515
Next.

01:10:48.515 --> 01:10:49.015
OK.

01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:57.060
Here are four examples.

01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:02.670
This is the original
square, 1631.

01:11:02.670 --> 01:11:09.010
The [INAUDIBLE] and the
elevation of Inigo Jones

01:11:09.010 --> 01:11:14.030
and the proposed arcades and
surrounding of the square.

01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:22.570
The square has a large empty
center like the Place Royale.

01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:31.855
And it's indicated in the first
of these four, up on the left.

01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:40.930
St. James Square on the right,
you see the enclosed garden.

01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:44.970
The entrances are
carefully selected.

01:11:44.970 --> 01:11:49.425
There's a monument to end the
vista from two of the streets.

01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:00.900
The Bedford square
on the top right,

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:04.470
1773, where you
get the manor house

01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:07.860
in the center of the elevation.

01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:12.540
Here, the street system
is not so carefully

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:16.920
considered in relation to
the design of the square.

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:23.600
And here, Belgrave
Square, now an attempt

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.090
to break the mold of
the Georgian square

01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:30.800
by putting the manor houses
outside the main elevation,

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:34.220
in the four corners,
opening the square.

01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:36.140
This is not a gated square.

01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:43.190
This is now a public square,
although treed, secondary manor

01:12:43.190 --> 01:12:45.560
houses in the center
of the facade.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.110
Next.

01:12:50.110 --> 01:13:03.664
Grosvenor Square on the
right, the manor house

01:13:03.664 --> 01:13:07.110
with the gabled facade in
the center of the facade.

01:13:11.405 --> 01:13:11.905
Next.

01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:16.300
OK.

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:18.640
We could have many
more illustrations

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:24.010
of these squares, the whole idea
of being able to link the crown

01:13:24.010 --> 01:13:28.750
property in Regent's
Park systematically

01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:34.915
through to Green Park
in Buckingham Palace.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:42.880
The number of intersecting
roads and the degree

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.885
of the difficulty
of purchasing what

01:13:46.885 --> 01:13:51.230
was cheap land and property
on either sides of the road.

01:13:51.230 --> 01:13:51.730
Next.

01:13:58.970 --> 01:14:03.260
This is looking up, northwards,
to All Souls' Church.

01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:08.570
What you see is that
spin-wheel of an arcade

01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:12.990
to turn you to the northwest.

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.490
Next.

01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:22.930
Booth's map-- here
is Regent Street

01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:27.850
in the quadrant leading
to Piccadilly Circus.

01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:34.150
Look at the black and gray areas
to the right of Regent Street,

01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:39.925
and the almost totally dark
red environment on the left.

01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:46.035
It's another one
of Booths mapping.

01:14:46.035 --> 01:14:48.115
That's of pubs.

01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:58.900
British [INAUDIBLE] gin until
they stopped drinking gin

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:04.000
and started drinking
tea are regarded as--

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.925
cited in one of the
demographies of London.

01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:11.440
It's a startling map.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:26.910
It's one of the first attempts
to connect social status

01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:29.980
with built form.

01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:30.480
Next.

01:15:34.166 --> 01:15:41.050
A 4-by-1-and-1/2 square,
Sir Joseph Paxton,

01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:46.420
after the Crystal Palace,
proposed an elevated walking

01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:51.940
route around the
4-by-1-and-1/2-mile center

01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:53.150
of the city.

01:15:53.150 --> 01:15:57.640
You can see this, all the
railway lines from the north,

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:06.430
from Paddington to
King's Cross, serving

01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:10.540
the north, industry to
north, and the three stations

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:13.120
on the south--

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:20.080
Waterloo, Victoria, and Charing
Cross, essentially serving.

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:27.550
And the British-- the
subway system in the center,

01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:32.950
moving outwards and then
connecting to a suburban

01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:40.240
railroad system, a remarkable
application of public

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:44.410
transportation
technology as early as--

01:16:44.410 --> 01:16:48.800
prior to the 20th century.

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:49.300
Next.

01:16:55.230 --> 01:17:00.840
Building the metropolitan line
on the left, the upper one,

01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:05.550
crossing the River Thames
with the train on the left,

01:17:05.550 --> 01:17:13.200
the embankment of
the sewage system

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:18.145
and the new sewer
lines on the right.

01:17:18.145 --> 01:17:18.645
Next.

01:17:21.210 --> 01:17:24.240
Marylebone and Euston
Street being the facades

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:27.180
of these great railway termini.

01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:32.260
Now, the railway termini
were ambiguous in themselves.

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:36.900
They were urban manifestations
with pronounced facades,

01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:44.760
and hotels, and enormous
formal energy expended in order

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:49.260
that you should penetrate
this railway station--

01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:52.800
which, after all, is just
a technological feat,

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:56.220
just a train and a railway
line, and some toilets,

01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:56.970
and ticket booths.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.830
It doesn't require
[LAUGHS] this apparatus

01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:07.850
in the front unless you're
conscious of the city.

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:10.530
I like a city which
pays attention

01:18:10.530 --> 01:18:13.350
to places of public
significance,

01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:15.974
even if it there's
only a toilet behind.

01:18:15.974 --> 01:18:17.412
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

01:18:17.412 --> 01:18:18.870
JULIAN BEINART: I
wish our airports

01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:22.890
had some way of galvanizing
their presence in the city.

01:18:22.890 --> 01:18:27.220
They are little
technological nightmares.

01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:27.720
Next.

01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:36.005
Charing Cross and St Pancras
Station being built. Next.

01:18:39.930 --> 01:18:45.540
Behind this neoclassical
Victorian facade

01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:49.590
lies the technological
enterprise.

01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:51.660
This is Birmingham
on the right, which

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:56.010
was the largest single span
at the time in the world, St

01:18:56.010 --> 01:18:57.330
Pancras on the left.

01:18:59.875 --> 01:19:00.375
Next.

01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:10.300
Attempts to indulge in this
internal space of the railway

01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:14.200
station with the same grandeur
that the external facade

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:15.665
on the street has.

01:19:15.665 --> 01:19:16.165
Next.

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:27.360
Victoria Station in England,
something of a market,

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:33.190
Munich being a taking
over of the center

01:19:33.190 --> 01:19:36.865
of the station as a market.

01:19:36.865 --> 01:19:37.365
Next.

01:19:40.330 --> 01:19:45.550
Victoria Station
in Mumbai, designed

01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:50.680
with the same atmospheric
aesthetic impulse

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:55.150
to pronounce itself as a
major monument in the city.

01:19:55.150 --> 01:19:58.690
And then inside, the
social consequences

01:19:58.690 --> 01:20:03.310
of poverty displaying itself.

01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:09.910
These two images, this and
the technological center,

01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:12.590
are interesting in themselves.

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:13.090
Next.

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:23.790
Here is another attribute
of the charity world.

01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:25.650
This is a working--

01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:35.650
a poor man's labor workstation
where people don't have work

01:20:35.650 --> 01:20:42.550
and are just left to be
fed and looked after,

01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:46.270
what the equivalent would be
today of a homeless shelter.

01:20:46.270 --> 01:20:52.510
On the right is a new
charity-inspired labor station.

01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:56.350
Now, instead of the
rough, random allocation

01:20:56.350 --> 01:21:01.840
of people in space, everybody
is now subdivided into booths.

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:05.500
And God is Holy and God
is Right in the beams.

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:09.490
The technology and theology
are mixed together.

01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:12.400
If you can make a
beautiful place,

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.700
God must be able to
be celebrated in it.

01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:20.665
It's making of poverty
a religious artifact.

01:21:20.665 --> 01:21:21.165
Next.

01:21:23.730 --> 01:21:28.680
And the greatest manifestation
of the technology--

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:30.810
the technology in
the Crystal Palace

01:21:30.810 --> 01:21:35.220
is without any
pertinence in the front.

01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:38.280
There is no attempt
to make an entrance.

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:42.060
This is just a
space for thousands

01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:46.440
of people to come and see what
the British are doing in India.

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.010
There are trees inside.

01:21:48.010 --> 01:21:48.510
Next.

01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:58.170
Modernism, modern
inventions are portrayed.

01:21:58.170 --> 01:22:06.900
One wants to compare
this to 1893 in Chicago.

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:09.231
This was 1851.

01:22:09.231 --> 01:22:14.710
50 years later, the same attempt
was attempted in Chicago.

01:22:14.710 --> 01:22:16.920
And we'll compare the two.

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:19.660
Next.

01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:25.500
That's the story of London, as
briefly as I can explain it.
