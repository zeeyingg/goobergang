00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.900
PROFESSOR: So now let's add
to our theory ways

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.120
in which droplets
can be removed,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.570
or infectious virions
can be removed,

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.140
within the room in addition
to ventilation and filtration

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.220
effects that we've
already described.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.190
So the primary
way that can occur

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.140
is simply by settling
of the droplets.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.540
So we've already talked
about the Stokes settling

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.640
speed, which scales as the
radius of the droplets squared.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.680
So basically, larger
droplets fall fairly quickly.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.370
And in fact, we've
already discussed

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.920
how they can fall to the
ground in a fairly short time.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.470
It could be on the
order of minutes or less

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.710
for large droplets,
such as those

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.670
which are spewing out of
your throat when you cough

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.440
or when you sneeze--

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.240
out of your nose.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.910
But also, the smaller
aerosol droplets

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.290
we've already
calculated can stay

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.620
in the air for a very long time.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.190
So they settle much more slowly,
but they do still settle.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.010
So we can try to see
how this enters in.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.400
And the second topic
is also deactivation.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.840
We've mentioned that the
virus doesn't live forever.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.630
So the virions in these droplets
do need to find a target

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.710
and get out of those droplets
and into some healthy tissue

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.020
to infect it within a
certain period of time.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.530
So there's a notion of
a viral deactivation

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.560
rate which can also be a
parameter in our models.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.930
So if we now add those two
effects to our existing model--

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.120
I'll just keep rewriting
our mass balance equation.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.650
And this is the mass balance
for the concentration

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.930
of virions in the air.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.750
I've also used the terminology
in chemical engineering.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.280
We're going to call this kind
of approximation the CSTR,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.300
or the continuously stirred-tank
reactor approximation.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.180
And now with all the
effects we're including,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.850
it's starting to look more like
actual modeling of chemical

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.280
reactors and chemical
plants by this method.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.990
So the mass balance tells me
that the volume of the room

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.680
times dc/dt--

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.760
or again, c is the
virion concentration

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.680
per volume in the air--

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.280
is the production
rate, P, minus--

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.440
and then we have a
flux, which is the flow

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.070
rate times the concentration.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.660
And there are several
flow rates here.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.370
There's Q, which is ventilation.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.200
There is filtration,
which is PF QF.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.120
And then we have now
a new term, which

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.890
I'll write in another color--

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.910
plus vsA.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.850
So that's the settling here.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.960
So that idea is, in
a well-mixed room,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.800
there is a complex flow profile
which is leading to the mixing

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.500
by convection of the air.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.670
And you might say, well, OK.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.490
That flow is very quickly
carrying the particles up,

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.840
carrying them down--

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.900
but on average, the particles
go down just as much

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.140
as they go up.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.440
And if it's well-mixed, then
the particles essentially

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.920
are sampling the whole space.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.570
And relative to that well-mixed
flow, which averages to 0,

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.640
they are slowly settling.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.260
And so a reasonable
approximation is to say,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.680
well, the removal is
basically happening

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.260
with a flux rate, which is
that velocity of falling times

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.760
the area.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.530
That's how quickly
those particles

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.750
are falling through
any horizontal surfaces

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.130
make relative to their average
0 motion from convective mixing.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.030
So this is the new
effect of sedimentation.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.730
And then actually, I will also
add to that another new term,

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.430
which is the deactivation.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.180
And so here, we will also add
lambda v times the volume.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.750
So this is just saying that
throughout the whole volume

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.350
of the room, there is a rate
at which every virion is

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.280
just slowly deactivating.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.460
That will be lambda
v. Also, if you

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.110
have any volumetric
treatments of the air,

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.690
such as chemical disinfectants
or even UV light,

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:21.300
that may also slowly deactivate
the virus or the virions

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.820
in the air with a term
that goes like this.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.250
So I'll just mention
that maybe briefly here.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.250
So lambda v is the
virion deactivation rate.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.770
And well, if we look
at tv which we've

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.560
talked about before,
which is lambda v inverse,

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.480
this is the deactivation time.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.110
This thing has been
measured to be of order

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.840
of 1 hour in some studies.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.400
But also , even greater than 16
hours in aerosol form in other

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.630
studies for SARS-CoV-2.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.670
So it could be potentially long.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.470
Also, this could include
effects such as I mentioned--

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.500
UV light treatments,
which might be operating

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.070
in a certain part of the room,
but then the air circulates

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.390
and we're essentially treating a
significant part of the volume.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.970
It could also be
chemical disinfectants.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.390
So there are various
chemicals that

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.360
can be sprayed in the air which
are believed to essentially

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.970
kill the virus or
deactivate the virions,

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.830
although they may cause
other harmful effects,

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.230
and so it's not so widely used.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.610
But in principle,
that would also

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.950
appear in our simple model,
lumped into lambda v.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.790
So let's put all these
effects together now.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.030
So again, we haven't really
changed the calculation much.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.230
We're just building it up
and making it a little more

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.750
complicated each time.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.870
So let's see here.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.510
So one thing we did
with this equation

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.630
is we divided both
sides by v. And so let

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.140
me write this equation
again after such a division.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.850
That would be
dc/dt is equal to--

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:23.180
well there's P/v. But
then we have over here--

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.270
Q/v is our lambda.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.190
But notice, all these
things are essentially

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.770
giving us a correction to
lambda, the relaxation time.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.520
And actually, I should
say this is a minus sign.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.610
So we get minus lambda.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.670
And I'll say lambda c, just
for the relaxation rate

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.380
of the concentration field.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.900
So we can lump all
these parameters

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.940
and we can write lambda c is--

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.860
Well, from the first
one, Q/v is lambda a.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.240
That's the air change
rate of outdoor fresh air.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.340
There is PF lambda F, which is
the rate of filtration times

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.560
the filtration efficiency, PF.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.740
And then we have another term
which we can write as-- well,

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.130
we have lambda v.
That's an easy one.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.880
And then the sedimentation
term is the one

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.710
I want to focus on right now.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:22.550
That is vs. We can write it as
vs/h, where I've divided by v

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.650
and I'm writing v/a is h.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.310
So I'm writing h equals v/a.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.250
So if we have a
rectangular box of a room,

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.230
then h is the ceiling height.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.670
But this is some kind of
effective ceiling height

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.830
if it's not a perfect box shape.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.820
But if you take the volume
and divide by the projected

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.280
area of horizontal
surfaces, then that's

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.140
giving you a sense of
the typical height.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.090
And that's the typical
distance by which

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.640
particles have to fall.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.780
And notice, velocity
is distance per time.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.750
So when I do vs,
and divide by h I

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.250
am getting something with
units of inverse time.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.920
So it's just like all
the other lambdas.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.880
It is basically a rate--

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.680
something per time.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.650
So this is the concentration
relaxation rate.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.640
I guess it would be the
theory on concentration

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.880
in the air, which is relaxing
at this rate, lambda c.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.130
And then we come back to
solving the same simple order

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.350
of differential equation
that we've done all along.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:39.330
And the solution's just c
of t is a steady state value

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.850
times 1 minus e to
the minus lambda ct,

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:49.620
assuming that this thing is
a constant for the moment.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:58.520
And also, we know that the
cs is p over v lambda c.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.200
So basically, if
lambda c is high,

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.820
if all these removal rates are
high, then that makes cs low.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.300
So the background
concentration of the room

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.590
is much smaller if these
lambda rates are all high.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.120
Also, if the lambda
rates are high,

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.790
then the relaxation
is very fast,

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.000
so you very quickly
get to the final value.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.580
And so that's actually worth
sketching what that looks like.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:31.670
So if I plot what is the
concentration, c, as a function

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.460
of time, we have
here this lambda c

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:38.610
inverse is the overall
concentration relaxation time.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:44.570
So it looks like an exponential
relaxation to a value cs.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.610
But I just want to
emphasize what I just

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.190
said verbally, looking
at these equations,

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.860
is that as I vary lambda c--

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.510
so if I have a fast relaxation.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.550
Let's say lambda c
is a large value.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.040
Then I start out
at the same rate,

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.740
but I saturate a lot faster
and at a lower value.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.240
So if it's here, this
is fast lambda c.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.990
So now if I increase lambda
c relative to the blue curve,

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.280
the whole thing comes down.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.300
But also, it relaxes
more quickly.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.200
On the other hand, if
I have slow relaxation,

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.020
because any of these
processes here are slow,

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.140
then I get something which
relaxes much more slowly

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.240
and ends up at a higher value.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.600
So if someone is breathing
infectious air out,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.080
exhaling, the infected
person, and there's

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.450
only very slow processes
in the room which

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.990
are removing that
infectious air,

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.750
then it's slow to
build up, but it

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.130
keeps building and building
and building until it finally

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:41.690
saturates.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.130
So this is basically,
whenever lambda

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.890
c, is not a large
value or slower,

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:50.760
you have a slow process, but
it also builds up a lot higher.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:55.000
So this effect of lambda_c is
very important to keep in mind,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.600
especially because
these parameters here

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.010
are not necessarily constants.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.350
In particular, v_S has a very
strong dependence on size.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.250
So these different kind
of saturation curves

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.680
are, at the very least,
dependent on the size

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.390
of the droplets that
we're talking about.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.260
And there's not just one size,
so we will come to that point.
