JULIAN BEINART: I should
thank Kevin Lynch.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.760
37 years ago, he stopped
me in the corridor.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.490
I was teaching in
the design program,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.200
and that was before we
had a separate section

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.810
for architecture and urbanism.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.770
And he said, you know, I'm going
to stop teaching this class.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.750
He had already
taught it since 1956.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.620
I said, why?

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.580
It's an important class.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.780
It's the only place where people
learn about the form of cities

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.310
in a systematic way.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.675
And he said, no, the
students are bored by it.

00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:09.670
There's just a
lapse in interest.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.040
So I said, are you crazy.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.600
He said, OK, well, you're
interested in theory,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.100
aren't you?

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.710
And I said, well, I am not sure.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.340
He said--

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.060
--I'll make a deal with you.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.190
If you teach it with me for
the next period, I'll continue.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.140
So we taught it
together for two years,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.110
and he just announced
that he's retiring,

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.960
leaving the whole
damn thing to me.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.900
That was 34 years ago.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:47.580
I have to thank him for
giving me the opportunity.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.090
Curiously enough,
Kevin and I have now

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:58.340
taught this class from 1956 to
2013, which is a long stretch.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.340
Neither of us will have
any formal education

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.370
in urban history.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.919
We don't teach urban
history formally.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.020
You can do a degree
in city planning

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.220
without knowing
where Priene was.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.920
It said neither
Harvard nor MIT have

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.100
treated urban history with
the dignity that it deserves.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.850
We had an alphabet,
but I suppose

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.770
seeing that Lynch and I--

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.340
you will see here as I
go through this class--

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.650
how much history there is in it.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.740
It's not history for
the sake of history.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.320
It's based on a fundamental
idea that accumulated knowledge

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.340
makes sense critically.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.770
The modern movement
in architecture

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.670
abjured the notion of
looking at the past.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.650
They were so
existentially bound up

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.610
with the present, nor the
future, for that matter--

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.320
I'll be covering some of this.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.957
I'm just digressing warming up.

00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:11.388
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.430
It's a class tradition
to do the last class.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.580
I'm not doing the last
class because it's

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.750
the last class for me.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.130
I'm doing the last class as I've
always done it for 34 years.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.560
That is, it's an
attempt to summarize

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.810
the material we've done.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.590
And as difficult as
that is, I'm going

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.710
to go through it tediously.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.910
I hope those of you who've
taken this class will forgive me

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.280
for going over what
you already know.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.480
There are two things that
I learned from Lynch.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.250
The one is that when you
posit an idea or theory,

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.590
theory is perhaps
an overblown word.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.200
I inherited the title
of this class from him

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.320
and never changed it.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.240
You have to, where possible,
supplement it with a fact.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.649
If you go down the corridor
to Lynch's archives,

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:20.970
you'll find his high school
notes on Kant and philosophers.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.600
We always thought that
if we were teaching

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.230
this class in France,
we would never

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.840
provide any evidence
for the theory

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.050
and just produce more theories
based on the theories that

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.950
preceded us.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.040
So I have the Chicago
tradition to follow,

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.310
which says that you
have facts to supplement

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.620
theory-- a very American
idea, if I might say so.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.210
The second thing is that
details are important.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.000
So when I tell you that
Joseph Bazalgette used

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.280
300 million bricks to build
the three cross London sewage

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.450
tunnels because of
cholera in the Thames,

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.790
you will understand 300
million is a useful figure--

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.140
for some people anyway.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:28.260
The last thing that
Lynch tried to argue

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.330
was that, difficult though
it is to find evidence,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.350
the easy relationship
between space and society,

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.310
and even if you had
to make blind cases,

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.440
it was better than
nothing at all.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.440
So, for instance, I argue that
the invention in Birmingham

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.760
in 1830 of the mortgage
system had profound effects

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.290
on British home ownership.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.330
The United States
lagged behind, and there

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.010
are reasons to
believe that the Great

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.770
Depression in this country was
the cause of there only being

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.305
balloon or standard loans.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.880
The mortgage system
provides security,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.280
and in the absence of
curious crooked landlords,

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.420
you dealt with a bank,
which provided security,

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.240
as microfinancing
in the Third World

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.300
is now providing security
for home ownership

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.920
to people who've lived
in insecure situations

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.750
all their life.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:42.910
But I can't argue that whilst I
guess that the mortgage system

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.530
reduced the density of London
by spreading it out as opposed

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.420
to Paris, which didn't--

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.060
the density of Paris
is about twice as much

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.770
as that of London--

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.250
but I have to guess that
the mortgage system has

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.410
something to do with it.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.510
There are not many
people who attempt

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.860
the steering business of
connecting space and society.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.760
I one edited an Italian
version of a magazine

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.980
by their name
[SPEAKING ITALIAN],,

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.970
so I guess I've
spent my life trying

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.200
to understand the relationship.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.690
And I'm not sure after 34 years
of slogging away in this room

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.860
that I'm any clearer.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.880
So what I'm going to do
is go through the material

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.590
we've done in this class.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.630
I'll try to be as
brief as possible.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:40.220
If you get bored, I
can't offer you a drink.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.180
You have to wait.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.070
I'll try to make
as many connections

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.040
as I can in the
material, but I'm

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.000
going to go through it as if
I'm talking to this class, some

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.220
of whom are here, and
they are the only ones who

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.070
are allowed to ask questions.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.766
The rest of you
are in a time warp.

00:08:07.766 --> 00:08:09.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.600
Remind me of that movie--

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.170
I can't remember
the title-- where

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:19.680
the time was changed, where
the past became the present.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.960
It's very strange
to see all of you.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.780
We start at the beginning.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.080
About 1,000 miles from where
I was born, archaeologists,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.240
such as [? Broome, ?]
Dart, and Tobias,

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.760
discovered a
3-million-year-old skull,

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.200
which they called
Australopithecus africanus,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.310
a fundamental link
between animal and man.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.470
The brain size of
Australopithecus

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.550
was about 400 cubic
centimeters, about 35%

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.185
of our contemporary brain size.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.390
The argument is that the
increase of brain size

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:08.160
is largely due to nutritional
change, such as Leakey's

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.010
first discovery of
the first [? index ?]

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.520
in the Olduvai Gorge in
Kenya, which dates back

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.560
to about 2.6 million years.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.700
Nutrition, and a little change,
is argued as fundamental

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.100
to brain increase.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.130
I don't know how much larger
the human brain can become

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.140
seeing we still
reproduce children

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:37.371
through female organs, which
are not infinite in size,

00:09:37.371 --> 00:09:39.440
though some people
would wish they were.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:52.580
I've often wondered when the
first item for storage of food

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.080
occurred.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.530
I think potter's wheels
must come very early.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:02.680
I can't imagine any other
permanent form of change

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.520
in nutrition.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.040
But the British
anthropologist Robin Dunbar

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.980
hypothesizes that human
brains grew faster

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.390
when surrounded by 150
others, a number he still

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:21.770
holds true for modern societies,
even in social media groups.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:26.490
You're supposed to
know only 150 people.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.340
His argument is that
brain size increases

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.230
when you're in a society.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.840
It's fundamental to the
premise of the city.

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:42.130
He goes on to even insinuate
that gossip or grooming

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.850
of newcomers requires
language, and language

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:49.930
comes from that need
rather than any other.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.420
It's often been assumed
the language derives

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.375
from men hunting.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:03.760
I use this beginning to
indicate the importance

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.880
of the educative potential
of the social city.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.720
And secondly, despite all
the talk about the city,

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.570
it's still in its
relative infancy,

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.810
at most 10,000 years in
about 3 million years

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.630
of human development.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:24.836
We've only been going
for 10,000 years at most.

00:11:24.836 --> 00:11:27.050
It's nothing.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.230
It took us 3 million
years to get a big brain,

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:36.540
and we've wasted it over
the last 10,000 years.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.120
It says that those of you who
are going to be graduating

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.610
still have a chance to improve.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.740
Your brain's not going
to get any larger,

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.300
but your capacity in
the use will increase.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.650
From there, we switch to Kevin's
three theories of city form.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:59.640
The first is the so-called
cosmic view of the city.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.020
According to
[INAUDIBLE],, archaic city

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.470
form had to do
with centeredness,

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:09.120
the celestial system,
ritual, and circular time.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:13.740
The earliest cities were
religious in nature and form,

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.040
superintended over be
omnipotent priests,

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.290
who secluded their
treasure in secret

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:23.810
in remote holy of holies,
such as the Temple of Marduk

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:28.550
on the 200-foot high
tower of Babel in Babylon.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:32.540
The Tower of Babel is
at its extreme height

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:37.800
for a compression structure
without independent support.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.520
And you put the temple of
the city at the top of it,

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.600
as you do in--

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.490
I did a small case of Jerusalem
to make an important point.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.970
I was fortunate to
work in Jerusalem,

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.090
both for the Palestinians
and the Israelis,

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:08.100
and had the chance to
autodidact a lot of its history.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:19.070
Solomon built the first temple
in Jerusalem in 1,000 BC,

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:28.020
a typical compression
fortress with remote sanctuary

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.420
and no public access.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.870
Sacrifice is part of the ritual.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.960
In the 7th, 6th
century BC, the temple

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.990
is destroyed by
Nebuchadnezzar, and the Jews

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:44.160
are taken into exile in Babylon,
the greatest city on Earth.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.880
There they, deprived
of a temple,

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.630
turn to pray in homes,
schools, et cetera.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.760
Despite having the
prophet Ezekiel

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.300
with them, which covers six
chapters in the Old Testament

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:01.860
detailing measures of
an envisioned temple,

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.470
they learn not to miss
the temple any longer.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.145
They invent a new form
of democratic religion.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.890
What the relationship is
between deprival and innovation

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:20.390
in cities is an
interesting idea.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:23.130
It's sometimes justifies,
in theorists' minds,

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:26.520
the notion that people
should be deprived.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:32.560
When I showed my work in
Johannesburg in London

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:39.310
at the ICA one day
a long time ago,

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:43.620
I showed the [INAUDIBLE]
Township wall paintings.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.380
And a man in the audience
stood up and said,

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:51.330
if I were in Germany, would I
be collecting Jewish scribbles

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.280
on walls?

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:59.160
I'd always seen the anarchistic
reaction to survival

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.250
as an important fundamental
human condition.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.880
He was turning it
around and saying,

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.550
one shouldn't
record the blemishes

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.970
of the past which have
succeeded in providing

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.820
an avenue for improvement.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.460
Anyway, back to Johannesburg.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.940
The Jews returned from Babylon
to Jerusalem, and Ezra--

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:25.890
the same name of my
grandson, not he--

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:27.975
read the Bible, and
the people wept.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.130
Towards the end
of the millennium,

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.440
Herod rebuilds the temple.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.080
Now priests, under the
embodiment of the threat

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.260
to the priests in Germany
because the synagogue

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:44.070
is appearing and democratic
religion is becoming

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.350
an argument--

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:51.630
before he dies, Christ
appears as a radical threat.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.400
He is the embodiment
of the threat

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.720
to the priests in Germany.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:04.560
In his famous statement in the
forecourt of Herod's Temple,

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.120
after years harassed
the merchants,

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.810
he says, "Soon the
temple will be destroyed.

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:12.770
Don't despair.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:17.030
From then on, my body
will be your temple."

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:23.060
Here is a form of substitution,
from autocracy to democracy.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.130
This is the origin
of the church,

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.760
the origin of the mosque,
the origin of the synagogue,

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.090
the origin of any form
of communal prayer--

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.790
at least in my view it is.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:42.360
I, therefore, not
as a Christian,

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.900
do not think Christ's death
is terribly important.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.350
It's only important
as a major transition

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:54.730
from the archaic
state of the world

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.960
to a beginning of a
new communal democracy,

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.190
at least in religion,
not in society.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.730
70 years later, the Romans
destroyed the temple,

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.970
and the Jews had a temple again.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:18.010
The Jews lived in diaspora
with their synagogue and book,

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:22.780
the Christians with the
celebration of Christ's body.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.980
The Catholic church
still, in miraculous ways,

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.040
uses the mass to
celebrate Christ's body.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.210
And my argument is that
it comes from this time.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:39.340
I'm not a Christian, so I can
be scatological about religion.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.670
I keep on being that way.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.410
Nothing convinces me.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:48.580
Nobody uses this argument in
the literature that I read,

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:54.950
because it's also theocratically
ordered that it can't--

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.130
this is a classic
case in which nobody's

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:02.100
making the radical argument
that the Son of God

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.190
can, in fact, change
an important function

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.870
in the world.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:14.420
We briefly discus the cosmic
idea in China and India.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:19.240
We also point to the wide use of
the idea in urban metaphysics,

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.520
for instance, when
Joseph Reckford refers

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.350
to the rationalist Roman town as
a dream, when Aldo Rossi refers

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:30.970
to two perceived cities, the
real and the simultaneously

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:35.500
ideally imagined, when the
French sociologist Maurice

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.470
Hauriou refers to
the stabilizing power

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:42.490
of urban memory, and so on.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:45.100
Lynch's second
theoretical model--

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.020
I'm going to have
to go on quickly,

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.415
because there's a lot of stuff.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.984
Fall asleep if you need to.

00:18:56.984 --> 00:19:00.740
Lynch's second
theoretical model,

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.040
the mechanical model
or the machine model,

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.970
covers a wide range of places
built for rapid construction,

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:11.870
often for colonial settlements,
be they for Egyptian

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:15.920
[? watery-side ?] workers,
Greek colonies where [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.740
links the colonial grid and
the needs of modern commerce,

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.890
Roman castramentation
and centuriation.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:30.040
The Romans built 5,627
separate civic bodies

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.860
across the world's
vast empire largely

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.530
through a central
financing system

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:42.880
and a central spatial system
which encompassed both city

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.290
and country--

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:48.160
castramentation is towards
the form of the city,

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:53.840
centuriation is a
continuation into standard.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.970
If you look at the area around
Imola in Italy, for instance,

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.870
you can still see these
Roman traces of squares,

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:12.100
each made by what an ox can do
in one day using a site chosen

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:17.990
by an [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:22.445
Roman centuriation or Roman--

00:20:22.445 --> 00:20:23.315
[DOOR OPENING]

00:20:27.275 --> 00:20:28.265
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.892
I don't know who you are.

00:20:31.892 --> 00:20:33.170
AUDIENCE: Oh, Andrew Woodmore.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.886
JULIAN BEINART: Andrew,
you've lost your hair.

00:20:35.886 --> 00:20:37.275
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:43.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it depends
on your [INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.100
It's good to see you.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:55.780
JULIAN BEINART: And Andrew is
one of our numerous illustrious

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.390
graduates.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:03.170
He did his PhD at
UCLA, and he just

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.850
published a book
with Sam Bass Warner,

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:07.040
which you should all have.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:14.240
We go on to other examples
of the mechanical model--

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.380
the French Bastide towns
in the southwest of France,

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.470
and the enormous impact of
the Spanish laws of the Indies

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.750
on Latin American cities.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:27.080
Spanish Latin
American cities are

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.290
founded on the rules of
the laws of the Indies.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.630
And still today, have--

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:39.570
you take a-- it's not take.

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.850
In the United States,
the laws of the Indies

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:46.320
were pronounced from
St. Augustine in Florida

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:52.120
in 1565 to Los Angeles in 1781.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.930
You take a town
like Albuquerque,

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.810
which is the subject
of one of our theses,

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:02.750
you will see it is
a hybrid town, mixed

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:06.140
using the rules of the
laws of the Indies.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.230
One of the rules of the laws
of the Indies is interesting.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.080
It refuses to allow--

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.750
it forbids Indians to
be allowed to enter

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:19.340
the stockade before the
Spanish cathedral is completed.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.980
A perfect example of
architectural and urban

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.700
form serving a mixture of
blatant colonial, financial,

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.880
and missionary purposes.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.650
It's not different,
very different,

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:35.410
from Edwin LaChance's use
of classical form in Delhi.

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:39.620
LaChance, after all, claimed
the Native Indians didn't

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.260
have any talent
at all, and if he

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.140
were asked to do a
capital in Australia,

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.170
he wondered whether he would
use the marsupial style.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:54.400
We also briefly reviewed
on numerous examples

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:58.040
of the application of
machine ideas to city form,

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.480
be they as distant to each
other as Captain Chambless'

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.800
moving linear American city
and the brutally efficient

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.200
consignment of Africans
in Johannesburg

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.990
to the barren land
of Soweto using

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:18.610
one model of a horse as its
basis and repeating endlessly.

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:21.610
The organic model, the
third of Lynch's models,

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:24.010
focus on the
interpretation of nature

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:28.000
in some form or other as an
adequate lesson in the making

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.420
of city form at
some scalar another,

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.730
either as real or
synthetic landscape.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:37.600
The other class focused
on a few theories,

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.830
none as significant as the
great Scottish biologist,

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.330
Patrick Gedde's--

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:47.560
whose work I've attempted
to follow as best I could--

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.920
whose writings and work
in Palestine and in India

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.110
introduced the
central application

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:57.940
of sensitive urban surgery, the
derivation of local culture,

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:01.670
the stable valley
section, and others.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:06.410
I regard he and his son-in-laws
plan for the Hebrew University

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:10.190
in Jerusalem as one of the
great pieces of organic

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:11.930
architecture--

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:20.630
not biomorphism, which I hate,
and find silly, and elusive.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:26.000
But the design for the Hebrew
University was much like MIT's.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.990
It is a set of corridor
systems oriented

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:32.280
towards a single center.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:36.210
You move from one discipline
through another to another,

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:40.700
much like you do or your
body seems to operate.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:45.220
At the center, you have
a dome as the coverage.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.690
The dome is not trivial.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:51.290
The dome is a biological
version of what

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.900
all religions appreciate.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:59.820
It's the architectural
synthesis for Arabs, Jews,

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.140
and Christians.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:09.080
So this is, to me, a brilliant
and logical use of an idea.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.100
He doesn't have to have
curved forms, like biomorphist

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.090
architectures do,
in order to satisfy

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:17.575
the deep structure of biology.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.030
It's one of my
favorite buildings.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:29.350
It's never built.

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:32.020
To examine the
relativity of nature,

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:35.890
we examine the USA's most
significant regional plan,

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:40.690
the TVA, and as many as
seven different [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.320
attributed to nature.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:47.850
The pre-TVA, Southern
agrarian resistant to change.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.310
Prior to '33, Roosevelt.

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:54.360
Henry Ford's view of nature's
embedded in agriculture.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.480
His belief that American
industrialization,

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.180
such as Detroit,
without agriculture

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.730
was a threat to the
survival of this country,

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.350
the good survival
of this country.

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:09.120
He proposed buying from
Congress one of the dams

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:14.700
at Muscle Shoals in Alabama,
the southern end of the TVA,

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:21.750
and building a 75-mile
linear city combining

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:25.350
agriculture and industry.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:29.850
His view of nature
was agricultural.

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:33.240
Roosevelt's vision of the
recuperative power of water

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:40.720
and green-- he used the term
water and green in 1933--

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.920
as beneficent to nature.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.370
The locating of the anti-nature
war-oriented research

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:53.820
of Oak Ridge in the TVA caused
another reading of anti-nature.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.020
The replacement of water supply,
energy by coal, and ensuring

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.980
coal ash disaster
in Kingston in 2008

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.310
caused The New York Times
to call this the greatest

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.640
environmental disaster
in America's history.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.470
This is also in--

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.630
nature is both a
beauty and a beast.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.480
We tend only to see
the beauty in nature.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.460
Survival sees the beast as well.

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:31.330
Why did archaic people look up
to the stability of the stars

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:32.860
and the sun system?

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:39.220
Why is the God Ra in
Egypt a permanent sign

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.470
of heliocentricity?

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:44.071
Because it's stable.

00:27:44.071 --> 00:27:46.440
If you don't understand
half the things that

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.600
happen to you when
you have to survive,

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.610
you look for stability.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.580
Tenancy is a security.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:59.790
Much though Hoover and Roosevelt
promoted taxation policies

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:03.960
for making homeownership
easy in the United States

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.630
and abjuring the
notion of rentership,

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:13.150
the argument was that a stable
world comes from a world which

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.550
owns land and property.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:19.180
In the case of Diadema in Sao
Paulo, which I will talk about

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.430
at the end, you
will see the return

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:25.310
to this fundamental notion.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:29.830
Really, in some ways, ideas
don't change that much.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:32.040
They're just
reinterpreted differently.

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.070
Back to the TVA, the
victory of the snail

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:42.510
darter by environmentalists
taken to the Supreme Court,

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:45.810
and causing America
to pay more attention

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:51.150
to endangered species, was
the first great victory

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:53.580
for modern environmentalism
in this country.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.120
Today, water supplies
only about 20%

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.670
of the energy
requirements in the TVA.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:12.490
Nuclear energy and
coal supply the rest.

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:17.680
Another ecological perspective
on nature at the moment

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.550
is pressing the
contemporary TVA to use

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:24.040
appropriate sources of energy.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.840
Tomorrow, for those of you--

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.960
you can see [? Kristen ?]
[? Zibert's ?] thesis on what

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.600
to do about the TVA today.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.530
I only use the TVA as an
example of the often radically

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:37.990
different uses that
the idea of nature

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:42.960
has to supplement an
ideological position--

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.710
not an ideological-- perhaps
a scientifically ideological

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:49.320
position.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:57.320
We spend two classes looking
at other theories of city form

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.280
other than Lynch's.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.330
Wherever possible, the theory
was connected to an example.

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:11.680
So, for example, when we looked
at the apparently value-free

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.550
[INAUDIBLE]
agricultural production

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:17.780
map in Southern
Germany, we locate

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:21.660
it next to Gedde's
good valley section.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:25.050
When we spoke of the
zone of transition

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:29.700
in the Chicago school concentric
circle model of a city,

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:34.230
we saw its zone of transition
as an important element

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:41.860
in the successful fulfillment
of the invasion succession model

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.040
in the American city.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:48.540
The American city has been built
by invasion and succession.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:52.890
And when Homer Hoyt ransacked
a model of the American city,

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:56.070
we mapped it against a plan
of apartheid Johannesburg

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:58.380
and Atlanta.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:04.030
And when Manual Castells,
in one of his wilder days,

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:08.590
used the term with The Wild City
to apply to the American city,

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:12.770
we argued it in the light
of American consumerism.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.380
We also looked at a
number of architects

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:21.245
who've made recent
propositions about the city

00:31:21.245 --> 00:31:25.550
as theory, on the one hand,
and practice, on the other,

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.950
other than Lynch,
Alexander, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:31.740
and Martin, and [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.040
I want to get on to
the next section,

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:41.340
and the next section deals
with the 19th century.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.710
In starting this
section of the class,

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:47.910
I argued that the 19th century
was the most important century

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:50.480
for you and urbanism.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.650
The so-called
Industrial Revolution

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:54.840
was the biggest event
in human history.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:32:00.040
Again, I dispute Muhammad, and
Christ, and all of these guys--

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.040
all of these gods--

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.840
and reply, the reality which
so fascinated Engels and Marx

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:11.830
in London and
Manchester was a reality

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:15.160
which was the most
inevitably transforming

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:19.000
of human civilization.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.280
I think sometimes
this is possible,

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.700
because I studied the history of
modern architecture at Harvard

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.790
with Sigfried Giedion,
who discredited

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:29.235
the 19th century completely.

00:32:29.235 --> 00:32:32.770
He used to come back
from weekends in Zurich

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:36.400
and say that he arrived on
Sunday and walked around Boston

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:42.500
and saw the horrible
furniture in the stores

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.420
in Boston's windows.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.970
They weren't any
modern shops yet.

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:52.180
He was filled with energy
about the bad smell

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:57.810
of the ruling taste in
European 19th century design.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:01.260
He said the only light
was the light sought

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:05.550
by the French painters
and by the good form

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:09.105
of the British Swiss
builders of bridges.

00:33:09.105 --> 00:33:12.550
That the French painters
were interested in a wider

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:17.570
range of things
than Giedion didn't

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.250
illuminate his discourse.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:29.590
So perhaps I'm a 19th
centuriest by exclusion.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.320
The sudden advent of
modern industrialism

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:40.060
and its occurrence in England
has never been fully explained.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:44.200
So we refer to a recent widely
published version of this,

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.980
the work of Greg Clark,
who argues, amongst others,

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.560
in studying wills
and other evidence,

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:54.760
that many, many
behaviors in the English

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.880
were transmitted throughout
their society which

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:01.000
led to the acceptance of
regular working hours,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.460
less fighting,
and the acceptance

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:07.960
of other social norms suited
to the industrial process.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:12.580
He argues this in a
kind of biogenetic model

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:16.330
and the transfer from the
wealthy, who lived longer,

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:19.000
to the poor, who lived shorter.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.100
He doesn't exactly
say how it works,

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:25.880
but it's a very
controversial new version.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.690
So, for instance,
cruelty to animals,

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:31.630
common in medieval games,
such as bearfighting

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:34.810
and cockfighting-- you'll
remember that Hemingway called

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:37.360
bullfighting the most
vestigial sport--

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:42.780
was forsworn.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:47.310
And activities, such as
boxing, fought between dwarves

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:52.590
and giants to amuse medieval
crowds on Sunday or Saturday,

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:59.900
whichever day they chose,
was rationalized in 1850s

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.630
by rules of equal
weights and times.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:06.200
More happened in
London between 1851--

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.990
the Crystal Palace, the
most significant building

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:10.670
of the 19th century--

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:18.740
and 1965 or '76 than
happened in history

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:23.360
in one city in its time.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.190
I'll go through
London in a minute.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:34.620
This industrial story
has had many tellings.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.830
The denial of the
long-standing Malthusian trap

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:40.770
is one of the most significant.

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:44.370
You'll recall that the
Malthusian trap consists

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.880
of the equation, the
demographic equation,

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.050
that population can only grow
when there's a food supply.

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:56.140
And this has not
been possible until--

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.760
well, Malthus wrote in 1799.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.820
He was still preoccupied by
the presence of the Malthusian.

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:06.900
The Malthusian trap was totally
destroyed by industrialism,

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.170
and cities began to grow.

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:15.370
So the denial of the
long-standing Malthusian trap,

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:17.680
the increases in
per capita income,

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.870
the massive
industrial-technological

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:23.320
advances, the
organization of labor,

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:29.030
the rise of
participatory democracy,

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:32.600
Engels in Manchester
watched, with Marx,

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.010
the rise of English democracy.

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:37.200
They were bored by it.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.250
Engels' relationship to
the chartist movement

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:41.540
is interesting.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.430
You see, they were
asking for too little.

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:46.470
Eventually, of course,
they were moved

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:52.170
to advocate revolution, which
they failed in 1848 in Paris.

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:56.220
And then subsequently,
Engels traipsed around Europe

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.645
selling a new dogma--

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:06.530
the elimination of
epidemic disease.

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:16.720
Jon Snow discovery three
years after the Crystal Palace

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:23.510
of the bacillus, which caused
the Thames to be a shit hole

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:29.230
and produce the
bacillus of cholera

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:32.290
in waves across
England, particularly

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:38.110
London, the Soho part of London,
John Snow's identification

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:43.360
of the bacillus led to
the immediate construction

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:49.550
of a bypass system to remove
garbage from the Thames.

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:54.020
The 400 million bricks
that Joseph Bazalgette used

00:37:54.020 --> 00:38:00.560
to build, finish in 1865 of
the three east-west tunnels

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.480
and the two embankments--

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.190
one of the things
about cities is

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:08.173
that you perceive them through
your eyes, not your feet.

00:38:08.173 --> 00:38:09.715
If you walk on the
Thames embankment,

00:38:09.715 --> 00:38:12.590
do you realize that
it's one of Bazalgette's

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:16.980
last, final attempt
to capture sewage

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:18.450
before it reaches the river?

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:26.470
I shouldn't denounce the visual.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:33.690
42% of the brain is occupied
with visual perception.

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:39.040
There are 10 to the
12 neurons, each

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.310
connected to 5,000
other cells which

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:47.000
equip us to see intelligently.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.450
When Charles
[INAUDIBLE] and I worked

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:54.710
on the design of the brain in
the cognitive science center,

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:56.840
I learned a bit of this stuff.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.750
And amazing business
that goes on,

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:04.670
if you've seen [INAUDIBLE]
research and how we see.

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:06.500
We don't see pictures.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.230
We see billions of
pixels appearing

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:11.660
on the screen of
our eyes, and we

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:16.070
have to make sense of what
is static and what is moving,

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:19.370
what is new, what is not,
what happens to that.

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:24.000
All of this is coded into the
electrical system of the brain.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.880
It is to make--

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:31.000
I can't remember who said it.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.030
Maybe Leon Wieseltier--
I don't know.

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.170
Peter, you would know.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:47.090
Seeing is not--
oh, I don't know.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:47.690
Forgive me.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:48.770
I don't know everything.

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:50.243
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:05.190
The evil side in the 19th
century was also on display.

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:07.650
Engels wrote about
Manchester's poverty

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:11.625
with aid of his illiterate Irish
worker mistress, Mary Burns.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:17.370
Engels did something--

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:19.620
I mean, I'm sorry to
go on about Engels,

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:23.080
but the condition of the
working class in England

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:28.510
in your book written in your
20s is not a bad piece of legacy

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:30.190
to leave.

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:32.306
But what Engels did--

00:40:32.306 --> 00:40:36.590
and I often compare
him to John Ruskin--

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:41.250
Engels walked in the city.

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:44.070
He tried to use his
body to pick up.

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:49.860
He asked his-- he would ask his
illiterate Irish worker friend,

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:53.340
why do they have no windows?

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.420
She'd give an answer.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:58.640
He'd say, why do the main roads
not pass through the town,

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.720
through the slums?

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.550
She'd give him an answer.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:07.580
John Ruskin, who
later in his life

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:12.440
after becoming the poet laureate
of England, wrote books like,

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:18.110
Unto This Last, for the
working class of England,

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:20.690
both combined a
social intelligence

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:22.910
with a physical intelligence--

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:25.280
not Raskin so much.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.700
Raskin says he learned
to see by looking

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:32.120
through the window of
his childhood bedroom

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:36.190
and counting the bricks
on the building next door.

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:39.190
For somebody who wrote
the conditional-- at least

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:41.890
the first book on
English painting,

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:47.710
on English contemporary
painting, it's a lot.

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:49.240
Anyway, I'm losing my way.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.280
I'm getting carried away.

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.120
I always do.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.960
There's something in
my brain which suggests

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.670
stories rather than evidence.

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:00.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:05.580
Stories are always
much more fun to tell.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.980
The extraordinary thing
about the British Industrial

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:12.720
Revolution, and why I'm so
fascinated by these tropes,

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:17.490
is that between Peterloo
in 1819 and Bloody Sunday

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:20.250
in Northern Ireland in 1972--

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:23.040
that's a 150-year period--

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:28.350
British troops nor police
killed no more than 11 citizens.

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:32.640
It's an extraordinary--
it transformed the world

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.190
at the cost of 11 people.

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:39.090
Oh, people died in
poverty and in childbirth.

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:42.330
I'll later tell you
the story of Ann Lee.

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:45.020
Who is Ann Lee?

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.766
Somebody in this class
must remember something.

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.890
Who is Ann Lee?

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:53.670
AUDIENCE: Shakers.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:54.270
JULIAN BEINART: Yes.

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:54.900
Good.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:55.680
There we go.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:06.710
Ann Lee worked 10 hours
a day when she was a kid.

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:08.720
She gave birth to four--

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:09.950
no, not stillborn.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:11.330
One was stillborn.

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:14.070
Three died in infancy.

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:17.100
She screamed out that
sexual intercourse

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.200
is the evil of the world.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:23.550
She got onto a boat in
1774, and came to New York,

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:28.840
and started the anti-sex
movement called Shakerdom.

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:32.350
This is part of our
tradition of the transference

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:34.000
from physical--

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:45.230
not perversion-- physical
pain to social behavior.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:54.700
The Enclosure Acts, the
violence of the Enclosure Acts,

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:59.280
removing independent agriculture
from the disenfranchised,

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:03.570
and the invention of
charity, British charity,

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:06.990
which never could,
and as it never can,

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:09.070
compensate for
the amassed wealth

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:11.295
that Marx started
calling capital.

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:19.730
I decided that the way to
respond to these conditions

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:22.670
was not as general
as this, but to look

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:28.180
at five cities and the
reaction to these conditions.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:30.830
The first was London.

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:32.300
London was the world's large--

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.840
I'm watching my--

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:41.230
London is the world's largest
in 1850, and so on, and so on.

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:44.080
I've spoken of a
Joseph Basalgette.

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.690
The greatest stage that's
provided for the emerging

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:50.230
middle class, the first
subway ran from Paddington

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:57.400
to Finches Street in 1876,
making the first stage

00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:01.570
in the world's best metropolitan
public transport system.

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:08.530
That, in part, enabled
London some 20 years later

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:11.380
to invest in automobile pricing.

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:18.070
Charles Booth made the first
map showing urban poverty,

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:20.830
and the effects of the invention
of the residential mortgage

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:24.760
system were an effect.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:29.170
Paris, in contrast,
followed centuries

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:31.210
of royal preoccupation.

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:34.900
Distances in France is still
measured from the center.

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.480
Unlike London, again, Paris
kept building-- unlike London,

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.280
which had only--

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:47.450
the further west you go, the
less you need in Europe for--

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:52.490
the biggest walls start
appearing in Vienna and Cyprus.

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:55.640
London hardly had any
walls to contend with.

00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:02.170
Paris kept on building walls
into the 19th century, often--

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:03.620
I won't make the relationship.

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.450
It's a tangentious one.

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:14.860
Paris reforming
largely due to 20 years

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:16.990
of a new form of
urban management

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:20.710
under the Prefect of the Seine,
who is allowed, after others

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:28.580
refused to engage in
the act, to engage

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:30.770
in a new form of
financing, namely,

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:33.590
borrowing capital to be
repaid on the increased

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:36.110
value of the improved city.

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:40.280
The idea of deficit spending
used here for the first time

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:43.460
has become current track
urban practice now.

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:45.750
It's national practice as well.

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:49.880
In fact, it separates
ideologies in this country

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:54.230
around the size of the debt
that we are allowed to carry.

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:58.670
Economists are only
right in one sense.

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:01.790
The other's all wrong.

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:03.710
For Haussmann, an
immutable budget

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:07.760
was never adequate to account
for the wealthy of the city.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.970
It's a brilliant idea.

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:16.580
It's the idea that you see only
an idea of economic progress

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:19.960
and investment.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.470
So in line with banks
also finding their way

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:26.250
in the new real estate, Paris
engaged in municipal loans

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:29.830
paid back only 60 years later.

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:33.050
Haussmann didn't invent
a plan for the city.

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:37.370
He's often accused of
inventing a plan for the city.

00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:42.020
The idea of boulevards was
taken by Marie de Medici

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:45.320
from Raynaud's Renaissance
Florence, where

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.320
the old idea of
playing in streets

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:50.570
was part of the
construction of streets.

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:58.330
The etymology of the
word, the American word,

00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:02.050
"mall," a place
where you go to shop,

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:05.790
comes from the
Italian words used

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:11.940
to describe the playing
of games in streets.

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:16.480
[SPEAKING ITALIAN] Is
that right, Antonio?

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:20.230
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]
"to hit the ball."

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:23.350
Pall Mall in London
and the American mall

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:27.070
come from the idea of
playing in streets.

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:30.100
Maybe there's some
metaphysical relationship

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:34.210
between playing in streets
and shopping in a mall.

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:35.000
I don't know.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.050
I never discovered it.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.030
Haussmann didn't invent
a new plan for the city.

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:48.810
One existed-- the whole idea
of making a town like a forest.

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:52.620
Like a [INAUDIBLE] system,
it was very fundamental.

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:59.010
And there were competitions
in the 18th century for Paris,

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:02.100
and the famous one,
after the Revolution,

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.830
a commission of artist plan.

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:08.980
So Paris added boulevards,
avenues, trees, parks,

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:12.250
improved public transport
services, buildings,

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:13.960
extended street enclosure.

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:23.300
Haussmann, despite all
of the negative qualities

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:26.360
that he arouses in
architecture, at least

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:29.870
had and made an attempt
to adjust architecture

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.540
to urban situations.

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:37.390
He believed that the
city needed to look

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:40.630
and believed that
architecture could render it.

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:44.620
Since the individualism of
architecture is so rampant

00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:48.520
and so few people
attempt, even today,

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:53.290
to create an architecture
based on an urban identity,

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:57.130
however, an identity is
created by great stars,

00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:00.910
individualists like
Zaha Hadid, when

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:04.870
it comes to making
a plan for Istanbul,

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:08.910
does the most awful
inappropriate pieces

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:09.410
of nonsense.

00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:17.440
So I'm more of a supporter
of Haussmann's thinking

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:20.990
perhaps more than his acts.

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:26.210
I disagree with Richard
Sennett on that score.

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:31.640
Bracketed between two
communal uprisings,

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.250
the [INAUDIBLE] to the
north remains unformed,

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:37.550
and it's not been helped much
by the recent international

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:41.110
competition for its reshaping.

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:42.910
We'll go onto Vienna.

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:47.290
Vienna's is largely
one of captivating

00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:50.740
unused infrastructure,
the mess of wards

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:54.700
and [INAUDIBLE] surrounding
the city from Danube to Danube,

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:58.190
fortifications that barely
resisted the Muslim attacks

00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:01.510
some 200 years before.

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.460
The world would
have been enormously

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:08.410
different had one day
not taken place in 1683

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:10.720
when the Muslims
almost captured Vienna.

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:13.840
Vienna had been dug
under, the walls,

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.900
and had it not been
the Catholic world--

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:20.590
it would have been impossible
to stop Islam had it not

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:25.630
been for the intervention
of the Polish King Sobieski,

00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:28.540
with his armed troops
coming from the north.

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:32.065
The Muslims always attacked
the city from the south.

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:41.360
Christianity prevailed
over Islam in 1683,

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:45.860
and the walls and their removal
have always played a role

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:49.980
in the psyche of the city.

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:54.640
The renovations of the walls and
the [INAUDIBLE] took the form

00:51:54.640 --> 00:52:03.270
of a long string of a street,
called the Ringstrassa,

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:10.350
with all kinds of non-religious,
liberal enterprises--

00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:16.420
government, education,
music, culture, housing--

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:18.200
along its street.

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:24.100
This is a continuous system of
urbanism, much an elevated form

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:28.370
of the American strip.

00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:32.060
It puts into question
two great theoriests--

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:35.390
well, not such a great
theorist, but a builder--

00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:41.360
Otto Wagner, who conceived
of these plans for Vienna

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:43.400
as being modern.

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:47.060
There's an expandable
endless stretching

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:52.100
out looking outwards versus
Camillo Sitte, who's, I think,

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:56.460
wrongly described by
Schorske as an archaist.

00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:58.290
He wasn't an archaist.

00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:01.700
He was somebody who believed
in the limited experience

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:05.360
of human perception,
and therefore,

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.990
wanted the Ringstrassa
to be a set of monuments,

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:12.650
each associated with
an enclosed open space.

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:16.460
His idea for the ideal
piazza was an enclosure, not

00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:17.585
a system of movement.

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:29.470
Barcelona-- the most common
approach to urban expansion,

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:33.010
to 19th century
urban expansion, took

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:36.820
the form of taking down
this old city walls

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:38.800
and expanding the
city horizontally

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:44.550
onto flat land where possible.

00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:48.150
You have plans, like Antonelli's
plan for Torino, [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:49.920
plan for Bali.

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.800
In the Barcelona example,
you have the largest housing

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.870
development in Europe.

00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:59.550
[INAUDIBLE],, an engineer,
returns to Barcelona,

00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:02.910
but does extensive research
on the terrible conditions

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:04.500
in the old city first.

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:09.720
He even studies health
and nutrition, diet, age.

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:12.870
He enters a competition for
the city's expansion plan.

00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:18.360
He wins it despite Trias'
neoclassical entry.

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:23.460
Cerdás' plan is a set of
truncated 113 meter squared

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:27.150
blocks, each with
open green space,

00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:30.420
stretching far beyond its
connection with the walless old

00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:34.230
city, with avenues, such
like the Passeig de Grácia,

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:37.860
one of Europe's great streets
reaching to the village

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:41.050
of Grácia in the hills.

00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:45.250
The Ensanche, as it's
called, is not so successful,

00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:48.790
but it's been built at many
times the density and coverage

00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:53.560
of Cerdá by subsequent
city authorities.

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:54.520
Who was right?

00:54:57.490 --> 00:55:01.570
Was the city right to grant
development privileges

00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:06.370
to the subsequent builders,
both of height and density,

00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:09.580
obliterating much
of the green space?

00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:14.810
To what is the-- we don't know
how to measure these things.

00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:18.500
Maybe Cerdás' plan would have
been very boring at the density

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:19.910
that he proposed--

00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:22.130
too much green space.

00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:26.210
Would the Passeig de Grácia
be as great a street as it is

00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:27.800
if it weren't as dense?

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:29.860
We're dumb.

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:34.180
In Barcelona, they can do
nothing else but cheer Cerdá

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:35.935
as much as a hero as Guadí.

00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:43.790
There's a story, which I
haven't got time to tell,

00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:47.000
which the Barcelonans
don't like,

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.220
and that is of Cerdá
belonging to a socialist group

00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:57.000
in Barcelona influenced by
a crazy French communalist,

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.260
called Étienne Cabet, who
came to the United States with

00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:05.790
a group of people, including
one of Cerdá's colleagues,

00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:13.180
and bought a piece of land
in New Orleans, almost died.

00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:16.360
They moved northwards and
bought the town of Nouveau

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:22.120
in Illinois, which had been the
site of one of the Mormon treks

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:22.810
westward--

00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:30.390
almost Stalinist plan of a town.

00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:35.910
But God learn us, that it had
anything to do with Cerdás.

00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:38.850
Each of these city forms
that I've just discussed

00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:42.250
produced a unique housing type.

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:47.200
It's another strange connection,
that if you do urbanism well,

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:52.520
you produce a good
version of shelter.

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:55.610
There is a residential
square in London,

00:56:55.610 --> 00:57:00.290
the boulevard apartment
in Paris, the [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:01.850
and the Hof in Vienna.

00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:05.630
I haven't got time to go into
the invention of Karl-Marx-Hof

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:09.660
in [INAUDIBLE] in 1927--

00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:16.280
the reaction to the war
and the establishment

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:22.280
of Red Vienna building
communal environments even

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:28.100
before the Russians attempted
the social condensers

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:29.880
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:35.360
I'll just take a
detour with Chicago.

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:42.880
Chicago is one of the few cities
established in the 19th century

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:45.180
like Johannesburg.

00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:47.697
The name of Chicago is
taken from the tribe

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:48.405
that lived there.

00:57:48.405 --> 00:57:50.925
It means wild garlic
in whatever language.

00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:58.940
The big idea of Chicago
was to link the Great

00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:00.860
Lakes and the Mississippi.

00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:03.740
Thus, providing a
continuous water system

00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:06.990
from Europe to the east.

00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:15.100
Well, that's before the canal,
the South American canal.

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.390
This never worked.

00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:20.350
But in 1830, it established
the beginning of a market

00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:27.350
for residential land,
which was endless.

00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:31.250
In 1848, this was
amplified by the building

00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:36.590
of the United States
cross-country railroad system.

00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:42.180
125th of the world's railroads
crossed in Chicago in 1893.

00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:44.910
This is in 50 years.

00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:51.580
Chicago's notion of
breadths of politicians

00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:54.340
is not associated with wind.

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:57.480
It's associated with hubris.

00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:59.040
This is the most--

00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:02.070
I don't know what the
adjective of hubris is.

00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:07.440
This is the most hubrist city.

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.570
It's the capitalist model.

00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:14.310
Hoyt described 100 years
of land values in Chicago

00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:20.250
according to peaks and valleys
in a very cyclical model.

00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:25.470
For every great
absolute mad investment

00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:26.910
follows a depression.

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:34.400
Nothing fascinates me more
than the immense authority

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:37.220
of the private sector.

00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:40.565
I think Frank Lloyd Wright
was fascinated by his clients,

00:59:40.565 --> 00:59:45.620
or so the book about
his clients suggests.

00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:50.270
People who had the
gumption to invent zippers

00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:55.230
had the gumption
to buy his houses.

00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:58.100
Everybody was in a mad
sense of invention.

01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:03.170
The most extraordinary
story is the building

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:05.930
of 60 miles of illegal
subway at night

01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:08.345
as if lying telephone cables.

01:00:08.345 --> 01:00:13.160
The idea that you can build
the underneath of a city for 60

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.010
miles of illegal subway--

01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:18.590
people were being killed on
the surface of the streets,

01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:21.760
because there was
no traffic plan.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:27.940
So the merchant class
decided to dig in the mud.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.890
It's a mud city.

01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:32.050
So the soft
underbelly of the city

01:00:32.050 --> 01:00:34.930
can be excavated over time.

01:00:34.930 --> 01:00:38.410
This was only
discovered in 1962,

01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:41.200
when the thing started
flooding and nobody knew

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:44.380
where the floods
came from in Chicago,

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:45.350
because of an accident.

01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:50.840
Now, Cronon's book,
Nature's Metropolis,

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:56.790
is a sardonic reference
to the use of anti-nature.

01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:59.880
You can see I'm not
a lover of nature.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.380
I'm afraid of nature.

01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:04.088
It causes you to die.

01:01:04.088 --> 01:01:05.904
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:11.555
I suppose I shouldn't say
that on my last class.

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:20.320
But 20 skyscrapers were
already built in 1893

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.870
by the time of the
Colombian exhibition, all

01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:24.630
of these on sand.

01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:28.360
Where is a less propitious
place to build a skyscraper

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.080
than in Chicago on mud?

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.160
And yet, they did it.

01:01:40.550 --> 01:01:43.490
One of the lessons
from the private sector

01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:47.830
investment in Chicago is
there was no attention.

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:53.400
There was a needless attention
to be paid to the public.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:57.480
It's perhaps best
explained in the novel,

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:04.170
Devil in the White City, which
targets Holmes, the psychopath,

01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:10.510
who took over a hotel
outside the grand ensemble

01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:17.240
of the World's Fair and
started killing women.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:21.590
There was no public authority
to supervise this man.

01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:23.960
There was no police
force to investigate it.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.450
Women just disappeared,
young women, who

01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:28.460
came innocently to the fair.

01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:38.550
Holmes was not eventually traced
for all his murders by Chicago.

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:43.590
He was traced by an insurance
consultant in Philadelphia

01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:46.560
who couldn't explain
some of these deaths.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:51.300
It's an enormous
disadvertisement

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:56.960
for a city which is built,
as some cities are today,

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:04.960
on the apparently creative
impulse of the private sector.

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:10.260
It's a dramatic economic system.

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:14.290
But it pays its
prices in other ways.

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:16.050
Chicago politics is--

01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:18.540
I shouldn't talk about
Chicago politics.

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:19.995
I know nothing
about its history.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:29.040
Burnham, the great manager
of the Chicago World's Fair,

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:34.950
proposed a plan in a
number of years afterwards.

01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:40.870
His plan was to
build a six-mile arch

01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:47.390
around the grid to centralize
the city to give it culture.

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:49.570
Some people have
taken on the idea

01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:52.960
that it's important in
developing countries

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.530
to build a city
first to make money,

01:03:56.530 --> 01:04:00.350
and then to invest the money
in upgrading its culture.

01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:04.560
It's a sort of transformative
staged process.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.340
It may have some merit.

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:12.220
In Chicago, the idea of Louis
Sullivan's grand auditorium

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:18.190
building with the most wonderful
toilets in the world attracting

01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:21.880
people who walk through the
mud is an interesting kind

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:22.960
of combination.

01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:29.290
I disagree with Mumford
and Sennett's view

01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:32.800
of the capitalist
grid as commodity.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:38.560
There was as much speculation
in Boston with its non-grid city

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.450
as there was in Chicago.

01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:43.880
Reducing space to
a commodity is not

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.310
only a capitalist phenomenon.

01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:51.110
It is an intriguing aspect
of the devaluation of land.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:58.420
I'm going to have to speed up.

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:00.040
We've got a lot still to cover.

01:05:05.070 --> 01:05:08.550
We took a look at panopticism
and the idea of the gays.

01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:12.180
This was largely helped
by David Friedman's work

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:14.820
on the evolution of the
late medieval street,

01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:19.050
from a street of work and
multiple invasions to a street

01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:22.030
dedicated to image and control.

01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:24.830
As examples, we
compared, in some detail,

01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:29.020
the multi-monumental and
multi-use Nevsky Prospect

01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:32.770
in St. Petersburg, and Hitler
and Albert Speers' proposed

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:35.850
central axis for Berlin.

01:05:35.850 --> 01:05:38.940
We also took a brief
look at utopianism.

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:41.490
I must say, I suffer
from a disinterest

01:05:41.490 --> 01:05:43.530
in utopian speculation.

01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:47.280
I find it either like as
dull as science fiction,

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:56.160
and as absolutely devoid
of understanding of cities

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.810
as most science fiction is.

01:06:00.830 --> 01:06:04.250
But we covered some
of the territory.

01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:07.790
I was fascinated by Thomas
Moore's invention of the word

01:06:07.790 --> 01:06:09.050
utopia.

01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:14.090
It has both the prefix e-topia
and the prefix e-u-topia,

01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:16.130
which mean different
things in Greek.

01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:17.900
Who is our Greek friend?

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:21.580
One is good and one is what?

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:22.300
Nowhere.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.080
AUDIENCE: Utopia?

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.420
[INAUDIBLE]

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:26.640
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.900
One is good and one is nowhere.

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:36.220
So Thomas Moore's island,
1516 book, is about an island.

01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:38.450
It's nowhere.

01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:44.060
It has shared-- it is a
socialist republic, which

01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:49.000
God learn us, how you
thought about it in 1516.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.370
There's terminal
limits to the amount

01:06:51.370 --> 01:06:54.230
of the houses you can occupy.

01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:56.650
It reminds me of a
little-- oh, forget

01:06:56.650 --> 01:06:57.910
about what it reminds me of.

01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:59.870
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.830
We looked at a number
of other cases--

01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:13.130
Pullman, Illinois,
Ann Lee and Shakerdom.

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:14.825
We also examined
three architects

01:07:14.825 --> 01:07:17.510
with utopian propensities--

01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:21.230
Le Corbusier and his endless
search for the right plan,

01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:25.670
be it in 1922 for Paris
with a capitalist center,

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:28.220
later for Moscow
after the revolution

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:32.660
there was a syndicalist plan,
and later in frustration

01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:36.590
because the citizens of Algiers
refused his many [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:37.100
plans.

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:40.610
He appealed for help to the
fascist Vichy government

01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:44.370
and eventually to
Mussolini for help.

01:07:44.370 --> 01:07:47.570
This is the strange
notion that--

01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:50.090
it's not so strange if
you're an architect--

01:07:50.090 --> 01:07:54.560
you find a solution which
emanates out of your soul.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:57.140
It brings together
almost everything

01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.985
that is creative about all.

01:07:58.985 --> 01:08:00.530
All your juices are flowing.

01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:01.640
It's the right one.

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:05.400
You examined 1,000, and
this is the right one.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:09.090
Whoever is going to buy
the right one is OK.

01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:10.920
Ideology doesn't matter.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.420
Society doesn't matter.

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:14.340
Space is what matters.

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.859
This is what drove
Lynch crazy when

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:19.529
I had the only argument
I ever had with him

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:24.189
in this class, which we
jointly taught for two years,

01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:26.830
about Aldo Rossi.

01:08:26.830 --> 01:08:29.560
When I introduced Aldo
Rossi's book, The Architect

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:33.319
in the City, in this class,
Kevin writes about it,

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:36.344
in fact, his anger.

01:08:36.344 --> 01:08:36.844
Sorry.

01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:45.300
We looked at Frank Lloyd
Wright's tiny Broadacre City

01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:48.750
as an evocation of
usonian democracy, which

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:52.200
used Henry George's
mantra of profit made

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:55.140
by development in the city
needing to be returned

01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:58.319
to the public good.

01:08:58.319 --> 01:09:01.250
We looked then briefly at
20th century resolutions.

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:05.060
We looked to Great Britain,
the New Towns expansion program

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:08.930
from the small towns of cities--

01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:10.640
30,000.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:16.180
By the way, there's
another curious phenomenon.

01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:19.120
Plato's ideal size
for a city is 30,000.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.220
Leonardo's is 30,000.

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:26.050
Ebenezer Howard, in 1910, later
within in London Garden City,

01:09:26.050 --> 01:09:27.080
are 30,000.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:27.580
Why?

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.290
It's demographic, I'm sure.

01:09:32.290 --> 01:09:35.410
30,000 is probably
the amount of people

01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:38.950
that you could, in
disease-prone society,

01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:42.340
maintain a certain size.

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:44.574
Given the Malthusian
trap situation,

01:09:44.574 --> 01:09:47.410
it probably works that way.

01:09:47.410 --> 01:09:51.540
So the British built their
first new towns, likely

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:54.450
Corby and Harlow, at what size?

01:09:54.450 --> 01:09:59.620
30,000.

01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:04.480
They became tired
of 30,000 size.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.970
Space-time suggested
larger size.

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:14.020
So mark two shifts to 50 to
100,000, the towns of Hook--

01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.760
the best book on
New Town planning

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:19.340
studies, the book of Hook--

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:27.200
Runcorn, Cumbernauld,
and the mark three towns

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:30.990
of Milton Keynes, now 250,000.

01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:35.700
Milton Keynes is a
postmodern attempt at a city,

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:39.440
mixed land use is using
performance dimensions instead

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.640
of zoning, a 1 kilometer by
1 kilometer space frame grids

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.790
to take maximum traffic loads.

01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:53.110
The earlier towns had no
predictive mix and tight fit.

01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:56.800
Cumbernauld Center was recently
voted the ugliest building

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.690
in England.

01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:04.170
We looked at Russia
between 1918 and 1932.

01:11:04.170 --> 01:11:08.750
We looked at the work
of urbanists looking

01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:11.150
at the possibilities
of new urbanism

01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:16.810
in the state which had
clients controlling

01:11:16.810 --> 01:11:20.580
the means of production,
land use, and apparently

01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:24.500
illuminated and
dedicated population.

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:27.240
Little gardens came from Marx.

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:32.680
A time of great experimentation,
the acronyms [INAUDIBLE],,

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:36.520
the invention of the essential
social condenser in housing

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:39.100
taken from the French
Fourier utopias.

01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:43.975
I'm tempted to tell
this little story.

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:48.820
The Republican Party
in this country

01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:53.290
was started in a town
called Ripon in Wisconsin.

01:11:53.290 --> 01:11:58.240
Ripon was started by a
bunch of Fourier socialists.

01:12:01.915 --> 01:12:05.990
The Ripon Society is still a
branch of the Republican Party.

01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:07.790
I'm not explaining
the full transition.

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:13.660
I haven't got time, but
the overlapping of systems

01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:17.000
is one thing that
keeps on intriguing me.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.480
One of the great adventures
of contemporary urbanism

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.600
is its search for
overlappingness

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.950
and multi-purposeness,
as both an avenue

01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:34.840
to deal with complexity
and the unknown future.

01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:40.860
I'm just going to
skip a lot of this.

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:45.225
We look at the La Ville
[? Vale ?] competition,

01:12:45.225 --> 01:12:52.850
a competition for tired workers
to escape from their daily work

01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:53.990
routine.

01:12:53.990 --> 01:13:00.760
And Melnikov-- the great genius
architect who invented the idea

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:06.040
of sleep enhancement so that
the Radio City Music Hall people

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:09.670
came running to Russia to see
whether they should put smells

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:14.350
in Rockefeller Center--

01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:18.635
he allowed that wild animals
should patrol the streets.

01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:25.760
Anyway, I'd like to go on
about the later reactions,

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:31.340
Khrushchev's 1956
edicts, and so on.

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:34.970
The next section dealt
with a question, what's

01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:36.680
the relationship between--

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.840
is there any
significant relationship

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:42.020
between how a city
is made and its form?

01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:45.320
Nine categories were
listed as possible methods

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:51.770
of city management and four
selected for close examination.

01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:54.920
First of all, they're
relying on a super figure.

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:58.610
We examine the effects of
Robert Moses, the greatest

01:13:58.610 --> 01:14:02.400
builder in American history,
on the form of New York.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.420
We also took as a
case study the process

01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:08.730
for the replacement of
the World Trade towers

01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:12.570
and conjured how different it
would have been under Moses--

01:14:12.570 --> 01:14:14.370
an interesting speculation.

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:22.230
We looked at the role of the
media, the media participation

01:14:22.230 --> 01:14:26.580
system, S-O-M, and
Silverstein, on and so,

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:28.980
and a whole bunch of
things, and didn't

01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:30.520
come to much of a conclusion.

01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:36.170
The idea that a
single architect who

01:14:36.170 --> 01:14:39.200
hadn't taken part in the
so-called competition

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.550
would be chosen as the final
client, final architect,

01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:50.000
is an interesting resolution.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.370
In reducing social
imbalances, we

01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:57.500
discussed the idea
of advocacy planning

01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:00.510
using the Cambridge and the
freeway connectors, our case

01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:01.010
study.

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:06.570
Thirdly, will reviewed
the many notions

01:15:06.570 --> 01:15:12.370
of changing people as a modality
to urban change, projects

01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:16.840
such as potteries,
[INAUDIBLE] schools

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:20.560
without walls, [INAUDIBLE]
situations in Paris,

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.140
metro education in
Montreal, and so on.

01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:32.900
OK, I'm going to jump things.

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:36.700
We're going to finish
a little after 2:00.

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:41.950
I thought there was too much
in 40 hours to condense to--

01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:43.540
what do you do?

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:45.420
Maybe we can go on
for a few minutes.

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.560
Dealing with the difficult
question, the relationship

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:55.400
between social structure
and spatial structure,

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:59.030
I decided to review
the literature.

01:15:59.030 --> 01:16:03.870
And it was too difficult to
isolate the relationship.

01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:08.720
So I decided, as a professor
of pathology would do,

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:14.530
to take extreme cases
in order to learn

01:16:14.530 --> 01:16:17.207
about this more trivial cases.

01:16:17.207 --> 01:16:18.423
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:18.423 --> 01:16:19.840
JULIAN BEINART:
Sure, don't worry.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:20.980
Don't worry.

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:23.804
I'm in an emergency as well.

01:16:23.804 --> 01:16:25.250
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.580
So I invented the
notion of bipolarity,

01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:37.525
where I could isolate
significant aspects of space

01:16:37.525 --> 01:16:41.570
and society and see them
in some relationship.

01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:43.910
We analyzed five
cities on this basis,

01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:47.300
and I'm going to have to go
very quickly through these.

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:51.360
Jerusalem-- the
assembly of polarities

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:54.420
ranging from religion,
ethnicity, nationalism,

01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:55.950
history, and others.

01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:58.500
Jerusalem, by the
way, has never been

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:03.660
the capital of any country other
than the Crusaders and Israel.

01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:09.380
So it's a rather
remarkable status.

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.800
To conjure up a
solution which was

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:19.780
shared equitably by all allowed
free access to religious sites

01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:23.040
and performed as a capital
city for two nations,

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:28.320
despite problems securing
customs was attempted.

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:31.530
This is a difficult
piece of work.

01:17:31.530 --> 01:17:35.160
We had to go through the
history from David onwards,

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:38.130
even dispute the
history of David

01:17:38.130 --> 01:17:43.370
that the Jews give as opposed
to the Palestinian history

01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:43.870
of David.

01:17:46.650 --> 01:17:49.140
The idea of David
building a temple as

01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:55.680
opposed to circulating the
ark amongst a nomadic people

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:56.550
was discussed.

01:17:56.550 --> 01:18:01.910
Corbusier does a wonderful
drawing of the Jews

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:03.165
as nomadic people.

01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:08.585
All of this came into our
vacation and understanding

01:18:08.585 --> 01:18:10.040
of Jerusalem.

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:12.620
How successfully, I didn't know.

01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:14.330
The world doesn't
have a solution

01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:16.160
to the problems of Jerusalem.

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:19.125
Why should we?

01:18:19.125 --> 01:18:21.410
We are an advanced
class in urbanism,

01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:24.700
but we can't do magic.

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:28.750
After all, Jerusalem has
been going for 3,000 years.

01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:31.990
It's gone through-- it's
been the most disabled city

01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:35.770
in history, the most
destroyed, the most rebuilt.

01:18:35.770 --> 01:18:41.890
It may well suffer as a cross
for the rest of the world.

01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:45.160
It's an interesting
idea, that it's

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:49.570
destined to be a kind of
crucible of some kind.

01:18:49.570 --> 01:18:52.720
In Johannesburg,
the second city,

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:55.540
we looked at the
spatial pattern.

01:18:55.540 --> 01:19:01.170
We traced explicitly on
race, and with it, income.

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:04.260
We traced the city
through its first stages

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:13.140
to its absolute distinction
of race in 1948,

01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:16.740
locating population
to the southwest,

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:18.460
and finally, and so on.

01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:21.690
We also did a study of municipal
waste in the native township,

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:25.080
a black community
of 15,000 renters,

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:29.970
who were being removed
after 50 years to Soweto,

01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:32.220
improve their housing
over the 50 years

01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:35.400
with additions in a communal
language of wall decoration.

01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:44.170
It's a study I did in
Johannesburg, which

01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:46.870
was on the cover of three
architectural magazines

01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:50.230
in September 1966.

01:19:50.230 --> 01:19:54.010
We studied the 11 [INAUDIBLE]
cities on the 2000-mile border

01:19:54.010 --> 01:19:56.680
between the US
and Mexico looking

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:58.990
at the polarities
of nationality,

01:19:58.990 --> 01:20:02.390
and culture, and
so-called development.

01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:05.350
We looked at El Paso,
Juarez, operating

01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:09.490
as a single major
metropolitan area,

01:20:09.490 --> 01:20:12.430
with each sector choosing
to maximize its options

01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:15.770
on either side of the border.

01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:21.180
We looked at colonial
Delhi and New Delhi

01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:24.870
as sites of distance
between colonial and native

01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:28.710
as polarities, the form
of the colonial settlement

01:20:28.710 --> 01:20:31.110
conscious of difference,
chose amalgams

01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:32.970
of nature architecture.

01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:36.660
The bungalow, on the one
hand, is suitable for climate,

01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:41.010
while using formal
facades to indicate

01:20:41.010 --> 01:20:43.410
separateness and superiority--

01:20:43.410 --> 01:20:47.580
the same phenomenon we found
in the laws of the Indies.

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:51.980
Similarly, the many
plans for New Delhi--

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:54.080
forget about [INAUDIBLE]
and New Delhi.

01:20:57.310 --> 01:21:01.600
We did a short trip to the
dialectical relationship

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:05.260
between country and
city in Havana and Cuba.

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:08.890
After the revolution, Havana
was deemed a frustrated city,

01:21:08.890 --> 01:21:12.470
while agricultural land,
such as the Picardura Valley,

01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:14.740
it was deemed by
the state to be more

01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:19.240
important in the national
consciousness and economy.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:20.680
It's interesting.

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:26.050
Henry Ford, who is an arch
anti-communist and anti-Semite,

01:21:26.050 --> 01:21:28.070
by the way, at the same time--

01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:29.700
interesting that
you can be both--

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:37.630
argued for the same advancement
of agricultural form

01:21:37.630 --> 01:21:41.250
in relation to industrial form.

01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:43.380
Curious patterns
that emerge when

01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:48.430
you go through this kind of
survey and look for these.

01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:56.200
So it's not unusual that
Lenin Park outside Havana

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.840
places the major
recreational element

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:01.450
of the city on the
outskirts of the city,

01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:04.330
much like [INAUDIBLE]
plan for Moscow.

01:22:04.330 --> 01:22:06.610
If you compare [INAUDIBLE]
plan for Moscow,

01:22:06.610 --> 01:22:10.120
one of the post-1918
plans, you can

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:13.900
see a similar configuration.

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:16.650
The last section of class--
and thank God we've got here--

01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:23.435
looks at four models,
contemporary or recent four

01:22:23.435 --> 01:22:23.935
models.

01:22:26.930 --> 01:22:29.420
We first deal with the
modern movement's interest

01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:31.520
in the form of cities.

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.190
The class follows
the discourse of CIAM

01:22:34.190 --> 01:22:39.200
from La Sarraz in 1928
to Waterloo in 1960,

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:46.630
and the conception of the
city as a pristine assembly

01:22:46.630 --> 01:22:50.620
of distinctly different parts,
as evidenced by Jose Sert's

01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:55.790
book, Can Our City Survive,
for which Lewis Mumford refused

01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:56.665
to write the forward.

01:22:59.550 --> 01:23:02.030
So this notion of
the city refused

01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:04.700
to admit any
knowledge of the past.

01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:07.640
Rather, Corbusier tossed
out the traditional streets

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:10.940
in his books and replaced
it in his [INAUDIBLE] plan

01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:13.040
with elevated highways.

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:16.295
It also refused the idea that
cities inevitably change.

01:23:19.010 --> 01:23:20.960
Its source of learning
about the city

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:23.780
was not in response
to everyday life,

01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:29.640
but to a technical adjustments,
such as extents minimums.

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:36.510
When [INAUDIBLE]---- forget
about [INAUDIBLE],, and so on.

01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:39.390
One of the first reactions
to the urban conventions

01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:42.180
of the modern movement is
a group of young European

01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:47.070
architects, who [INAUDIBLE]
many [INAUDIBLE],,

01:23:47.070 --> 01:23:51.360
advocating intense
interactionism--

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.540
[INAUDIBLE]

01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:57.270
Smithson's doubling up
of streets in the Berlin

01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:59.970
Hauptstadt competition
or the making

01:23:59.970 --> 01:24:02.580
wide residential
corridors to resemble

01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:07.480
continuous pedestrian streets
in Parkhill, Sheffield.

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:10.110
The urban world had to be
understood as a more complex

01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:13.080
reality, seeking
merit in change,

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:16.770
both short-term and long-term,
and users playing a role

01:24:16.770 --> 01:24:20.310
in the making environment,
a phenomenon they called,

01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:23.640
the wonderful word,
"socio-plastics."

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:26.310
Perhaps we all engage
in socio-plastics.

01:24:29.610 --> 01:24:37.430
We looked at a
number of attempts

01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:40.700
to theorize about this period,
the [INAUDIBLE] adaptive

01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:44.150
urbanism, strategy for
dealing with growth,

01:24:44.150 --> 01:24:50.060
[INAUDIBLE] work at the
MIT on the MIT campus

01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:54.574
extending itself systematically
with a kind of intricate DNA

01:24:54.574 --> 01:25:02.030
of corridor with single-centered
staircases, facades, and so on.

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:04.370
We followed with
three case study--

01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:08.030
the first of New University
plans from the orthodox Sussex

01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:11.450
campus plan through
the universal 50 foot

01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:15.060
by 50 foot by 13 foot
high Loughborough

01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:18.770
model, the whole idea being
here that a university can

01:25:18.770 --> 01:25:20.690
be predicted--

01:25:20.690 --> 01:25:24.815
use can be predicted in
the USA by preventing--

01:25:24.815 --> 01:25:28.490
by oversupplying
each regular item

01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:31.070
with sufficient
energy and system

01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:34.520
to allow it to change freely--

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:39.230
not a very sophisticated
idea, ultimately to the Free

01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:42.620
University in Berlin, where the
designers predicted a future

01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:45.950
form to be created by
the university users.

01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:51.600
So this is the ultimate
dedication to the idea

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:57.730
that anybody can design
without any rules,

01:25:57.730 --> 01:26:03.490
that, as Chomsky suggests we are
dedicated learners of language,

01:26:03.490 --> 01:26:06.010
we are dedicated
learners of building.

01:26:06.010 --> 01:26:10.540
It's a very current idea in
the work of Slum Dwellers

01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:14.350
International, the great new
paradigm for the Third World.

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.910
We have-- I hope I've got time
to do a very brief case study

01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:27.820
of Diadema with you at the end.

01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:31.990
We looked at the idea of
temporary accommodation

01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:33.520
in two cases.

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:36.970
The live-in Euro rotation
cycle of temporary exhibitions

01:26:36.970 --> 01:26:41.920
in the center of Paris
from 1855 to 2000.

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:45.280
Almost every 11 years,
Paris was transformed

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:48.970
in its center in want the
playwright, [INAUDIBLE],,

01:26:48.970 --> 01:26:54.220
calls a transvestite center
to a stone site city.

01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:56.920
You can see Kevin
Lynch's interest

01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:00.340
in time zoning in What
Time Is This Place?

01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:04.270
That the city adjusts
at different rates,

01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:06.040
that you build at
different rates,

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:14.170
that you associate
space with time in a--

01:27:14.170 --> 01:27:18.850
I'm saying ritualistic manner,
not in the archaic ritualism

01:27:18.850 --> 01:27:21.830
of Madurai.

01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:23.000
This is the wrong class.

01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:27.550
Sorry.

01:27:27.550 --> 01:27:30.530
Hey, it's Alexander.

01:27:30.530 --> 01:27:32.060
I couldn't see you that far.

01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:34.220
I've got my glasses on.

01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:35.360
Fine, then.

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:39.050
Come and sit here in front.

01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:40.250
We're just about done.

01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:46.760
We looked at the idea of
the role of temporariness

01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:51.380
in cities, in major cities,
as I said, with the 1855

01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:56.030
to 2000 cycle, changes
to the center of Paris.

01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:59.900
Curiously enough,
this time-centeredness

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:03.350
is evident again in
the various attempts

01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:05.930
to build these
temporary exhibitions.

01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:14.400
The building across the Seine
looks like a wedding cake.

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:17.940
The Eiffel Tower is finally
allowed to be built,

01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:19.830
because it looks temporary.

01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:23.100
The Eiffel Tower remains as
the major producer of income

01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:27.340
for Paris other than taxes.

01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:30.150
The rest is disappeared.

01:28:30.150 --> 01:28:37.820
So what looks to them temporary
is plaster and wood or metal,

01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:40.010
and what is temporary
becomes permanent.

01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:47.140
And the third case,
the second case,

01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:50.410
is we follow the Olympic
games, which over a century

01:28:50.410 --> 01:28:53.050
now has become a four-year
temporary visit to world

01:28:53.050 --> 01:28:54.070
cities.

01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:59.090
We looked at it from
1896 to London again.

01:28:59.090 --> 01:29:01.550
London has had it three times.

01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:05.990
We looked at St. Louis
in 1904, Paris in 1900,

01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:10.100
the invention of the first
Olympic games housing

01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:14.870
project in Los Angeles in
'32, the greatest games

01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:19.760
of all in '32 in Los Angeles.

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.590
We looked at the
reciprocal version of it

01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:26.120
in '36 in Berlin, all
seen as temporary.

01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:30.860
Hitler, of course, didn't
understand temporariness.

01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:32.790
He pulled down the glass.

01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:36.620
He had the glass taken out of
the stadium which they used

01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:40.460
and replaced with concrete.

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:45.380
Albert Speer designed a new
stadium for 400,000 people,

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:51.290
admitting that you
couldn't see anything,

01:29:51.290 --> 01:29:53.750
but only admitting
that you'd have

01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:56.060
to change the rules
of the Olympic games

01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:57.610
in order to hold it there.

01:29:57.610 --> 01:29:59.415
Hitler said, don't worry.

01:29:59.415 --> 01:30:01.040
It's going to be--
in four years' time,

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.170
it's going to be
in Tokyo, and then

01:30:03.170 --> 01:30:04.580
it's going to return to Berlin.

01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:06.440
It won't be
temporary any longer.

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:08.690
It will be in Berlin forever.

01:30:08.690 --> 01:30:11.900
Hitler was an
extraordinary urban mind.

01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:16.850
He understand that to devise
the '36 games, at the time,

01:30:16.850 --> 01:30:21.720
that the concentration camps
with Avery Brundage, the leader

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:25.550
of the Americans,
denounced this fact

01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:32.950
by accusing America to be run by
The New York Times and by Jews.

01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:38.740
What a fairly common ploy.

01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:44.380
OK, we dealt with--

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.980
I'm sorry, we need
another five minute.

01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:51.180
AUDIENCE: It's 2:00, though.

01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:52.138
JULIAN BEINART: I know.

01:30:52.138 --> 01:30:53.998
This is a special class.

01:30:53.998 --> 01:30:55.492
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:05.560
OK, we looked at Aldo Rossi's
philosophy about permanence,

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:10.370
and Léon Krier's advertisement
for classicism is a timely

01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:12.850
solution to urban development.

01:31:12.850 --> 01:31:15.190
I became intrigued
by the two forms

01:31:15.190 --> 01:31:18.370
of knowledge of the
past, history and memory,

01:31:18.370 --> 01:31:20.640
at the conference I
chaired in Jerusalem.

01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:30.750
Memory has a long association
with the physical environment.

01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:35.010
Ruskin's memory is one of his
seven lamps of architecture.

01:31:35.010 --> 01:31:38.970
The mnemonic was used in
architecture in Greek times.

01:31:38.970 --> 01:31:44.340
People paraded in the book on
the magical palace of Matteo

01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:47.880
Ricci, you learn to debate
by entering a house,

01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:51.570
making your argument in the
center, going to the right

01:31:51.570 --> 01:31:53.650
to make cause, going
back to the center

01:31:53.650 --> 01:31:56.027
to reinforce your argument,
going up the stairs,

01:31:56.027 --> 01:31:57.360
going to the left and the right.

01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:05.470
We know very little about the
relationship between memory,

01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:09.130
and architecture, and urbanism.

01:32:09.130 --> 01:32:13.140
We know that about
Paradise Lost and Cain

01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:17.450
calling his first city in the
Bible after his son, Enoch.

01:32:17.450 --> 01:32:20.015
The great French sociologist,
Maurice Halbwachs,

01:32:20.015 --> 01:32:22.310
and the power of
collective memory--

01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:24.110
I haven't got time
to go into it--

01:32:24.110 --> 01:32:28.670
one of my most
fascinating stories--

01:32:28.670 --> 01:32:30.770
not stories-- a great theorist.

01:32:30.770 --> 01:32:34.800
He wrote the book,
Collective Memory, and is

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:38.310
I think the single
most penetrating mind

01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:42.100
about urban metaphysics in all.

01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:44.250
That's saying a lot.

01:32:44.250 --> 01:32:48.440
I didn't talk about
contemporary memory systems.

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:50.960
Robert Musso's claim
that nothing becomes

01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:53.270
more invisible than a monument.

01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:56.390
The Navy and Air Force,
which are-- the Air Force

01:32:56.390 --> 01:33:00.890
Memorial in Washington, which
I had something to do with,

01:33:00.890 --> 01:33:05.990
having the notion of updating a
system of keeping up with time.

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:22.110
I go into the apparent dichotomy
between public and private,

01:33:22.110 --> 01:33:24.910
using a metrics of
user ownership, access,

01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:27.600
meaning to demonstrate
the overlapping

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:30.120
between public and private.

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:33.420
I shall talk about
the private law

01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:35.700
courts in the anonymous
states [INAUDIBLE]

01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:39.780
in Boston and the federal court
building, which faces the sea,

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:43.930
and only McDonald's
faces the public city.

01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:48.040
We then go on and on
about the American spirit,

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:51.950
the various agencies,
which contest--

01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:57.185
I spend a few minutes
denouncing the new urbanism

01:33:57.185 --> 01:34:02.350
as a solution to social
equity and to transportation.

01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:05.265
I then, in the last class,
deal with the global South.

01:34:09.550 --> 01:34:12.180
The statistics are alarming.

01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:14.940
I just have time to
quote one or two.

01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:17.970
Almost half the global
population lives on less than

01:34:17.970 --> 01:34:19.920
$2.50 a day.

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:23.250
That is more than 3
billion people, almost all

01:34:23.250 --> 01:34:24.930
in developing countries.

01:34:24.930 --> 01:34:27.540
According to The World
Bank, the richest 20%

01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:29.580
of the world's
population accounts

01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:34.140
for 76% of all consumption,
while the bottom 40%

01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:37.290
account for only 1.5%.

01:34:37.290 --> 01:34:40.170
The world will have to build
1 city of 1 million people

01:34:40.170 --> 01:34:45.450
every 5 days for
the next 42 years.

01:34:45.450 --> 01:34:47.700
It predicts that
31 villagers will

01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:51.900
arrive in an Indian city every
minute for the next 43 years--

01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:55.740
700 million people in all.

01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:59.760
Coupled with climate change,
40% of the world's population

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:04.320
lives on or near coastlines.

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:08.790
The combination of
poverty and climate change

01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:16.130
is a drastic disaster
token for the next phase

01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:18.510
of world urbanism.

01:35:18.510 --> 01:35:23.520
I try to talk about the
Slum Dwellers International

01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:29.250
paradigm of self-help
instead of governmental help.

01:35:29.250 --> 01:35:33.210
I talk about the
lack of hope that we

01:35:33.210 --> 01:35:35.690
have in world agreements.

01:35:35.690 --> 01:35:38.570
I remember Woodrow
Wilson in Paris.

01:35:38.570 --> 01:35:42.650
Woodrow Wilson in 1919
attracted the largest crowd

01:35:42.650 --> 01:35:44.330
in the history of
Paris, because he

01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:48.110
came to cement the
League of Nations

01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:51.290
as an international
governing phenomenon.

01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:56.060
We haven't, with Kyoto, a
miserable Kyoto in Copenhagen,

01:35:56.060 --> 01:36:00.750
we haven't even reached a crowd.

01:36:00.750 --> 01:36:05.130
I talk about microfinancing
and then talk about the success

01:36:05.130 --> 01:36:07.530
of microenvironments.

01:36:07.530 --> 01:36:14.400
Diadema, a slum 15
kilometers from Sao Paulo,

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.960
and its success, it's just
attracted its first shopping

01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:22.100
center there-- the fifth
most violent homicide

01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:24.680
rate in Brazil.

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:28.680
Education rates were pathetic.

01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:32.290
Child birth rates
were off the charts.

01:36:32.290 --> 01:36:36.510
It's now reversed
all of these indices.

01:36:36.510 --> 01:36:42.180
It's used the Workers'
Party to stimulate trust

01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:45.510
to find financing
mechanisms for new housing

01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:49.640
for the subdivision of land
for the creation of tenure.

01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:56.220
Trust and security
are what a writer

01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:58.500
about microfinancing
from Thailand

01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:02.580
suggests is what helps develop--

01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:06.240
is one of the sources of
development for the future city

01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:09.020
in the poverty world.

01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:11.540
I'm sorry it's been so rushed.

01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:14.330
I'm sorry that I have
to keep people outside,

01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:17.740
but we've got a story to tell.

01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:20.030
Thanks, again, for
all of you for coming.

01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:21.970
I hope it hasn't
been boring listening

01:37:21.970 --> 01:37:25.510
to what you heard 34 years ago.

01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:26.710
I hope I've changed.

01:37:26.710 --> 01:37:34.500
In the meantime, I've become
more arrogant and more angry

01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:39.660
with large theories about things
without Lynch's attachment

01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:42.070
to detail.

01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:44.400
OK, thanks a lot.

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:46.500
[APPLAUSE]
