00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.110
PROFESSOR: So now,
let's begin talking

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.320
about the spread of
disease, initially focusing

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.110
on a population of individuals.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.420
So the type of modeling,
which we'll be discussing,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.970
is sometimes referred to
as compartmental modeling

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.180
because a population is divided
into different compartments.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.450
Such as, for example, a set
of susceptible people that

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.000
have yet not been infected,
a set of infected people,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.110
and finally a compartment
of recovered people.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.290
Additional compartments
could be added, for example,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.450
for different age groups or
sub-populations, for incubation

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.760
prior to infection
by the disease,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.720
and, for example, death and
separated from recovery.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.020
This type of modeling based
on population compartments

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.360
was introduced by
Kermack and McKendrick

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.930
in the simplest case of what
is called the SIR model, where

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.610
S is the number of
susceptible, I number infected,

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.470
and R the number of recovered
individuals in a population.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.450
And the dynamics
take a simple form

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.950
of a set of coupled nonlinear
Ordinary Differential Equations.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.030
So first of all,
the rate of change

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.130
of the number of
susceptible people

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.660
is minus the transmission
rate beta times S times I

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.420
because SI base refers
to how many pairs

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.900
of susceptible and individual,
or infected persons there are,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.180
and beta is the transmission
rate per such individual

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.680
pair.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.450
And then, next, we look at
the dynamics of the number

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.160
of infected persons.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.450
So that starts by a conversion
from susceptible to infected.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.400
So beta*S*I is the rate of
producing new infected persons.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.699
And then, we introduce
another rate, constant gamma,

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.400
which is the removal rate.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.400
So this could be
people are removed

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.579
from the infected compartment
either by recovering

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:26.070
or, potentially, we could
lump into that, dying.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.040
So we finally complete
the balance here

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.890
by writing the number of
recovered, changing as gamma*I.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.310
So basically, we
have a model here

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.430
with three compartments
and two rate constants.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.370
Now the important
aspect, really, here

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.590
is the rate of change of the
number of infected individuals.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.930
So I'll write that
equation over here, which

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.840
is dI/dt equals, and
let's factor out gamma

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.990
and write the prefactor
here on the rate

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.050
as (beta*S/gamma-1)
times gamma*I.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:11.120
And if we look now
at early times,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.280
then the number of
susceptible people

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.290
is approximately equal to the
initial number, at t=0.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.690
So that's essentially the
size of the entire population,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.040
typically.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.240
And so we would then write this
as beta*S0/(gamma-1),

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.190
times gamma*I.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.250
So now this is just a
formula that at early times

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.940
gives you an
exponential increase.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.480
So we would then find that I
grows like the initial number

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.320
of infected persons.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.700
It could be, for
example, just 1 times

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.430
e to this factor here times t.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.480
And I'm going to write it
in a certain way, which

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.750
is (R_0-1)*gamma*t.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.450
So this is the early times.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.070
And then we have put
a little squiggle

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.740
here to indicate that's
the initial growth

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.000
rate or the initial dependence,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.850
where R_0 is beta*S_0/gamma.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.360
And this is called the
reproductive number

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.500
of the disease, or
of the epidemic,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:32.550
because we can see here
that if R_0 is bigger than 1,

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.470
then we have an
exponential growth

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.210
of the number infected persons.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.810
So then we essentially
have an epidemic

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.570
starting from an
initial index case,

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.290
or some set of
cases, numbering I_0.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:54.720
Of course, if R_0 is less than
1, then we have no epidemic.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.330
In other words, there may be
an infected person or two,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.250
but the number will
exponentially decrease,

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.230
and there won't be any growth.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.480
So the reproductive number
is an important concept

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.300
in epidemiology that comes
directly from these models.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.230
Related to that is the concept
of herd immunity, which

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.260
is the point where enough
members of the population

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.960
are immune that the
epidemic starts to die

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.160
out and eventually disappear.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:29.550
Let's make a plot of the typical
predictions of the SIR model.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.820
So as a function of time, the
number of susceptible people

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.630
starts at some value
S_0, and it decreases.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.780
Initially, the number
of infected persons

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.270
starts at some small
number I_0, which

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.440
might even just be one index
case, and as we showed here,

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.710
it exponentially increases.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.090
The number of
recovered starts at 0

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.000
and increases as
well, with some delay

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.320
given by the recovery time.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:11.180
And what we then see is that
as the number of susceptibles

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.250
comes down-- let's look
at this equation here.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:20.460
We can write this as
(beta*S-gamma)*I.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.780
So initially, (beta*S-gamma)
is positive.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.810
It starts, in fact, at the
value (R_0-1)*gamma.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.870
But eventually, as the number of
susceptible people comes down,

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.690
there's a certain point
where this factor goes to 0.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.970
And that would be leading
to dI/dt equal to 0.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.600
So, in other words, a maximum of
the number of infected people.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.400
So at some point, there's
going to be a value where

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.860
this will turn around.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.400
So dI/dt is equal to zero.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.480
And where that happens will
be at a certain value of S_0,

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.240
which we'll just put--
of S, I should say.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:08.220
I'll call that S_h for the
value of herd immunity

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.140
in the susceptible number.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.210
And that is when
this factor

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.030
beta*S-gamma is equal to 0.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:24.740
Or in other words, S_h
is gamma/beta.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.220
OK, and once we
get to that point,

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.730
then now dI/dt is
going to change sign

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:32.980
and will only be negative.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.260
So the number infected
will only be decreasing.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.080
Notice S is strictly
decreasing because this

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.260
is a negative rate here.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.620
So S only continues
to go down, which

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.980
means that the prefactor
here is always negative.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.180
So the number of infected
people now, at this point,

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.270
must also necessarily
continue to go down,

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:55.790
and ultimately the
number of susceptibles

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.720
will, from that
point, tend towards 0.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.670
The number of recovered
will tend, of course,

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.160
with some lag to S_0.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.540
So this is the
number of recovered.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.110
This is the number
of susceptible.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.360
And the number of
infected, of course,

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.810
also goes to 0,
something like this.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:23.550
And ultimately, in the
long run, the decay--

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:27.960
because S is going to 0,
dI/dt is minus gamma*I*t.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.090
So the final rate of drop
here is -gamma*t.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.070
So basically, the
recovery rate is really

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:39.870
dominating how quickly people
are being converted, basically,

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.919
from, to create the
recovered and remove

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:46.030
the infected population.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.550
So the final result here that
comes from these models, which

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.990
is quite interesting,
is to ask, what

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.170
is this fraction of
the population that

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.240
needs to become
immune, or what is

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.210
this sort of threshold
of susceptible

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.320
in order to achieve
herd immunity?

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.060
So if we look at what is
this S_h over the initial?

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.120
So how far do we
have to go down?

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.070
Well, that would be
gamma/(beta*S_0),

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.140
and you'll recognize
that that is

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.310
nothing more than the inverse
of the initial reproductive

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.950
number.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.000
So essentially, herd
immunity is reached

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.140
at a value of the susceptible
fraction becoming 1/R_0.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.690
And this is an
interesting prediction

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.870
of this very simple
model, which is

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.760
that more infectious
diseases that

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.320
have a very high value of
R_0, for example, smallpox,

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.590
leads to a situation that,
when the epidemic finally

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.860
ends, the number of susceptibles
when you've reached herd

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.290
immunity, well, when this
starts to turn around,

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.390
is actually quite low.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.170
So, in other words,
you have to go very far

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:00.590
in infecting the population
to start to end the epidemic.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.190
Conversely, a disease that
has a small value of R_0,

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.450
even COVID-19, might
be a value of say 3.5,

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.090
then this fraction here
might not be so [low].

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:18.110
It might be, maybe,
only say, 20% or 30%.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.140
Where you can start to see then
herd immunity being reached

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.480
and the number of infected
people going down dramatically.
