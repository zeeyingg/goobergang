00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.630
JULIAN BEINART: I want to
focus on the American city,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.270
the contemporary American city,
and the anomalous controversies

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.570
which range both
in the profession

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.490
and outside the
profession as to what

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.380
the condition of the American
contemporary city is,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.760
including everything from
smart growth to new urbanism

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.890
to the spread of
[INAUDIBLE] city and so on.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.510
What I'm going to
do is I'm going

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.100
to give you a number of inputs.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.850
Some of them you will
disagree with completely.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.110
Some of them you will agree
with depending on your position.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.040
I'd like you to listen to
the comment if you want to,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.500
but I will continue
this on Thursday first

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.520
focusing a little more on
decentralization technologies

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.420
and climate change.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.000
I want to switch to another
complicated project.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.700
That is the contemporary
American city.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:57.110
It is, again, a
project about which

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.670
there is very little agreement
except like cultural groups who

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.550
have vested interests in
believing that one form is

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.700
superior to the other.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.330
Cities have always
expanded when they could.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.620
Horizontal land is
cheap to build on

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.920
provided you can
get there, provided

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.270
you don't have obstacles
like defense, fortresses

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.320
or topography or anything else.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.670
Assisi was built on
the slope of a hill

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.750
and all of the valley land
could be used for agriculture.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.120
It was a very smart move.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.950
It also provided better
climate high up in the value

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.350
and also provided
protection if necessary.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.440
There was water around the city.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.550
These are all logical decisions.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.980
The American city was
relatively contained

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.920
until relatively recent times.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.930
I'm just going to go
through and give you

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.560
a sketch of the history
of the American city.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.850
Cities have always
expanded horizontally

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.420
and is covered by walls natural
barriers or the inability

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.210
to communicate over distance.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.910
Policies such as greenbelts or
the exclusion of immigrants,

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.210
the 16th and 17th
century attempts

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.610
to restrain the growth of
London to exclude the poor

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.580
or the apartheid restrictions
on Black immigration

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.360
in South Africa have not been
able to maintain themselves

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.340
over time.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.610
Recent urban policies
have included

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.280
allowing low density
suburban expansion,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.220
building dense public
housing on the periphery,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.820
establishing new towns or
allowing poor immigrants

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.330
to squat in minimally
controlled settlements.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.440
American cities was chosen
in the first of these models.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.410
The suburbs in the early
years of the 20th century

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.620
were made up of large
lots and made possible

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.750
by the invention
of the telephone

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.790
and pre-automobile streetcars.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.790
The telephone-- The Socialist
[INAUDIBLE] Telephone

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.850
is a book which you should read.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.375
I'll talk about it more
on Thursday's class.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.740
The telephone was introduced
largely for rural populations

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.350
to feel less distant from
the rest of the world.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.830
Before World War II less
than half the nation owned

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.550
their homes, and less than
half the housing stock

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.460
was in single family homes.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.280
After the war, the percentage of
families owning their own homes

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.230
jumped from nearly
40% in 1940 to 60%

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.620
in 1960 due to a
number of things,

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.780
high incomes, the
Federal Highway program

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.090
incentives for home ownership
as a stabilizing social force,

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.750
Federal Housing Association,
the Veterans Association,

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.955
financing, and other factors.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.840
It's this combination of factors
which created and still creates

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.730
suburbia.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.360
It's not due to technology.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.590
I'll give you a piece that
I wrote attacking my Manuel

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:12.330
Castells for some of the
stuff that he was advocating.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.040
What has the cell phone done
to the use of public space?

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.590
Bill Mitchel, unfortunately,
deceased now was dean here

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:38.580
and wrote books about virtual
technology affecting space

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.162
was wrong.

00:06:41.162 --> 00:06:43.530
AUDIENCE: Why?

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.410
JULIAN BEINART: Well,
what has happened

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.040
is that people can communicate
with each other much

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.320
better and much faster
and much more frequently,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.890
but it doesn't matter
where they are.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:01.680
You don't have to go into
the Piazza to call somebody.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.480
It is a form of ubiquity rather
than a form of concentration.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.390
AUDIENCE: But there
are some activities

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:16.550
that before that technology
came or the internet

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:22.490
or data, wireless, there were
activities that were heavily

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.050
linked to a place.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:29.750
They had to be done there, and
now you're not forced to do so.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.530
JULIAN BEINART: Exactly
you're agreeing with me.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.930
I asked you what
the cell phone is

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.670
contributed to the increasing
use of public space.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:41.570
In what form?

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.125
I don't understand the answer.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.050
I can call you from here or
I can call you in an office

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.360
down there and say let's meet--

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.340
let's meet for a drink at
Rockefeller Hotel at 8:00

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:55.840
tonight.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.470
What's different?

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.780
Only the speed is different
from me telephoning you

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.450
in the morning or
sending you a letter

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:11.650
or sending your
message via pigeon

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.720
or whatever form
of communication

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:19.090
we used prior to cell
phones, but the density

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:24.460
of Rockefeller Center
doesn't depend on the advent

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.590
of the cell phone.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.680
The cell phone is
more likely to be

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:35.600
a ubiquitous distributor of the
space used than a concentrator.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:44.690
The same argument
goes for computation.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.530
The number of people in the
United States who work at home

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.620
is measured in a number
of different ways.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.410
If you have a
cupboard and you have

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.490
a computer in your cupboard,
you work at home whereas in fact

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.800
all you do is you
most of the time

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.810
play games on your computer
and don't do any work at all,

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.780
but you measure this
working at home.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:17.310
The number of people working
at home is an uneven commodity.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.540
I was in a conference
in Texas where

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.620
they were discussing
this phenomenon,

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.270
and the real estate people were
advocating all kinds of things.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:31.780
Let me just finish
this, because I

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.020
forgot to go through the
reading list with you-- at least

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.900
the handout with you.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:48.310
Levittown built 150 standard
25 foot by 30 foot cottages

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:53.830
a week, each costing $7,900
requiring with a government

00:09:53.830 --> 00:10:01.360
subsidized loan a monthly
payment of $58 for 25 years.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.860
These suburbs attracted
the planned shopping center

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.290
and architecturally
unified development

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:12.770
with large amounts
off-street parking.

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.220
Suburban growth has broken
the link between city center

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.780
and its outskirts.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.680
In 1975, people who
commuted from home

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.990
to work in the
suburbs outnumbered

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.360
people who commuted
to the central city

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.760
were almost 2 to 1.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.040
I wonder if I
should take a break.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.780
Outlying suburbs now called
urban villages or [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.890
cities are more diverse in
land use, have larger houses,

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:01.540
in 2,000, the American house
averaged over 2000 square feet,

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:06.320
twice as large as
it was in 1970.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.715
And they have become
different cultural enterprises

00:11:08.715 --> 00:11:11.020
than the post-world
World War II suburb.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.930
I'll go into that a
little while later.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.700
Private automobile
traffic continues

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:26.590
to increase from 1
billion miles in 1970

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:31.150
to 1.5 billion miles in 1987.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.400
And road space
over the same time

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.650
decreased from 61 yards
per vehicle to only 31--

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.930
to only 39.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.770
While new cars are cleaner,
the condition of the air

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.220
is worse in part because
of the increase in car use.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:53.270
Now these figures are
not updated to 2000.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:59.720
Laura, I want you to tell me
what the recent figures are.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.530
You are our only
transportation consultant here.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:12.730
These figures don't
include for the increase

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:16.150
in the purchase of smaller
cars, hybrid cars, and so on.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:28.740
But recent calculations
of automobile distance

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.600
traveled largely
on social trips,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.960
not so much on journey to work
trips, because journey to work

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:43.670
is not very easily
served by transportation.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:47.620
There's a diagram in
one of the package

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.640
I gave you by Robert Cervero,
the author of Transit

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.008
Metropolis.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.940
Inner city had this
form, and majority

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.870
of the population
worked in one place

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.900
or encountered social
activity in one place.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:39.080
This system, the line
haul, was relatively

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.920
elementary be it a street
car, [INAUDIBLE],, or later

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.960
on a subway.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:53.210
The line all depends
on accumulating people

00:13:53.210 --> 00:14:00.680
for the space in between
the various line haul,

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:11.600
and we get along good.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:19.680
The problem, once the generation
of trips starts being this--

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.790
to work centers
which now proliferate

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:34.170
outside the centers of city
and form a random pattern.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:42.950
You get the problem of how to
introduce public transportation

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:47.420
into the distributed
system, which

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.600
is much more difficult
than the line-haul system.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:15:03.970
We did a project
when I came to MIT

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:08.890
trying to use dual-mode
technology to have

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:12.430
the same vehicle which
operated on the line-haul leave

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:17.200
the line-haul system operate
on the distributor system

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.080
and then join the
line-haul system again.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:29.320
It involved a small vehicle
which had the capacity

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.680
to run on the rail and
also to leave a rail

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.392
and run on the land.

00:15:35.392 --> 00:15:41.740
The distributor system would
be serviced by the telephone.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.200
In other words, you
would call and say,

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.110
I want to go to downtown Boston.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:50.080
And it would say, wait.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.670
In 2.6 minutes time,
you'll be picked up.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:58.950
And you'll be in Boston
in seven minutes.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.920
This project to
link the distributor

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:15.110
and line-haul system to make
one hasn't been applied anywhere

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:16.250
in the world.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:18.605
It depends on too
many variables,

00:16:18.605 --> 00:16:20.820
and it's too expensive.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.620
But it is technically feasible.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:32.380
In the meantime, we
have Cervero's diagram,

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:41.410
which tries to make a set of
concentration points outside

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:57.150
linked in various ways, with
small connectors out from this

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:02.970
involving one of the problems
of public transportation.

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:08.268
That's interchange.

00:17:08.268 --> 00:17:14.460
What an automobile provides
you is one line to service,

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.112
even if it's slow.

00:17:16.112 --> 00:17:18.930
You get into a car,
you're in charge.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.510
You can decide where
you want to go.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:30.630
The problem of moving from
a fast underground line

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:37.910
to a surface bus
line is problematic.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:43.100
If you have connecting
systems with a train running

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:47.120
on the same level in
a terminus with a bus

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.350
system or many-rail system,
you can simply cross.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:56.030
Some of the European
systems are of this kind.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:18:04.330
The chances are that
you will not use the--

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.400
but can you imagine a
system in Los Angeles

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:12.410
today where you have to compete
with an automobile on a freeway

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:18.620
by introducing a bus and a
train system as combining.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.860
The one is late.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.500
You miss one, you are to wait
a half an hour for another one.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:34.040
Public transportation
is available only

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.190
as a function of private use.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:42.230
The cost of maintaining a superb
public transportation system

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:47.100
depends on paying for it
either through subsidy,

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.200
which is never enough,
as in the case of Boston.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.075
MBTA is constantly bankrupt.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:19:04.280
And one of the things that
congestion pricing has shown

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:12.650
in London is that if you take
a toll of private automobiles

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:19.710
before they enter
into a central space,

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.720
you reduce the
number of cars that

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.200
are willing to pay
the x number of pounds

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:30.240
that it takes to enter the
space, meaning that you can--

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.900
this toll doesn't pay for--

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.200
help the public
transportation system enough.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:47.540
But what does happen is that,
because the roads in this space

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.480
are less heavily
traveled by cars,

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.400
it means that the bus system
can move much more speedily

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.390
and accurately.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:03.890
I think after x number of
years of the London congestion

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:06.590
pricing system, they've
introduced something

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:14.000
like 100 new buses running on
time and with air conditioning

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.620
and all kinds of conveniences.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.570
16% of carbon
emissions have also

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:27.370
been reduced as a result
of congestion pricing.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.310
Congestion pricing is
one of the new artifacts

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.040
of the large metropolitan area.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.610
It hasn't been applied
in New York because

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:41.410
of a conflict between the
city and the rural rest

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:42.160
of the state--

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:47.410
a basic conflict in the United
States system of government.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:51.535
We still depend, in the Senate,
on votes of people in Idaho.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.230
I was just thinking--

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.940
you know, we're talking about
cities and having problems.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:11.430
How long have cities
existed, including

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.730
the first permanent
settlements-- say, Jericho,

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.950
8000 before Christ?

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:20.340
How many years is that to today?

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:27.120
20,000 years?

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.728
What are we now, 2000?

00:21:31.728 --> 00:21:35.430
Add it to 8000--

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.780
10,000 years.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.320
It took 2.6 million
years for human beings

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.145
to develop a brain
large enough to think.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.290
And we're talking
about 12,000 years,

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:57.130
which is nothing in time.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.740
And we're expecting
perfect answers

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:03.670
to communal settlements.

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:04.630
So relax.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.955
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:13.710
We teach-- I say this
because I'm an architect

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:17.040
and have taught design
studios endlessly.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.940
We tend to idealize
the world that we--

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.530
and smooth the world round.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.515
I remember when I worked
for an Image of the City--

00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:33.980
it's a research book--
with Kevin Lynch.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.070
Gyorgy Kepes, his
compatriot, asked

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:41.180
me to take a walk down
Washington Street on a busy day

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.660
and just note all the
things that I saw.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:50.990
I made this tabulation of
all the things that I saw--

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.940
where the sun was
shining, what noise

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:56.570
there was, what signs
there were, and so on.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:01.010
And I came up and
presented my work and said,

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:06.440
this is such an unbelievably
confused Washington Street.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:11.750
I don't know anybody makes sense
of it, because at that time,

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:16.320
all urban design was
Victor Gruen's work,

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:21.740
and how to use modernism
to clean up conflict.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:25.790
Shopping centers had
unified signpost control,

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:31.370
and here I was trying to say
the real world is infinitely

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:32.390
complex.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:38.300
And yet, because we have 10 to
the 12 neurons in our brain,

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.540
each connecting to
5,000 other sites,

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.930
we have the electricity,
electronic system, which

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:46.760
can manage such complexity.

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:54.560
I think it's a message
worth remembering.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:06.330
Maybe it'll become much clearer.

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:10.440
But I think working as
you do as an urban design

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:14.550
in the midst of a
dialectic of opposites

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:18.570
is an intelligent place to be.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:24.360
I don't know the resolution
in the world's global economy

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:28.530
between the idea that
what is yours is yours,

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:33.270
and what is yours belongs
partly to a group of people,

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:35.745
as Henry George would
have liked to have argued.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:45.000
In my life, the debate between
socialism and capitalism

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.650
has not abated.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.320
There have been modifications
and conjunctions

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:55.710
and attempts to develop
alternative models.

00:24:55.710 --> 00:25:01.860
But essentially, most of you
live in the capitalist world.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:07.820
You will be struck
between the premise

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.850
that you live in
a liberal state.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:12.530
You are allowed, in
the liberal state,

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:16.310
to choose what system of
communication you wish.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:19.740
In this case, you will
choose an automobile.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:24.560
There will be no taxation on
your automobile use of street

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.170
except what you pay for gas.

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:33.905
And gasoline taxation for the
use of the roads is minimal.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:40.390
So what do you do?

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.770
I'm just arguing-- you've
got a decentralized city.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:49.630
You've got a spread city.

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:53.650
I've argued that we need
enormous incentives for people

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:59.980
moving out from the dense center
to horizontal space outside--

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:05.770
sometimes very long distances,
sometimes more compact.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:11.320
I'll give you a piece
that I wrote on the change

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.910
in the American downtown.

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:16.060
There's been a
homeostatic relationship

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:20.750
between the American downtown
and the suburban world.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:24.550
American downtown is
now increasing in value

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.510
and attracting more
and more people.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:34.495
Only 17% of people in American
downtown are under 20.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.570
So the world is
still one in which

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:42.870
most people in the
American city seeking

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:47.130
to educate their children
will move to suburbia--

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.580
often in the direction
of places where

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:56.610
suburban, because of
residential real estate taxes,

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.370
are paying for good schools--

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:07.380
rather than staying
in the inner city.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.890
If you stay in the inner
city in the Americans,

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:12.585
and you have enough money,
you pay for private school.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.570
So if you live in the
Back Bay in Boston,

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:22.260
you don't rely on the state
to educate your children.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.980
You pay enormous subsidies
to educate your children.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.690
It's all crazy.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:38.130
It means that the incentives
for living in suburbia

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:46.620
are established very quickly
and very difficult to dislodge

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.410
in a free society.

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:56.040
I don't foresee the American
city changing its shape

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.010
significantly.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.010
AUDIENCE: I think it's--

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.170
I mean, I lived in
DC for two years,

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.900
and it's changing already there.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.240
And the other
factor that I don't

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.460
think people are
considering enough

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:12.270
is that poverty is
moving to the suburbs

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:16.350
and that's going to create
a really fast flood.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:20.400
JULIAN BEINART: Well,
one of the arguments

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.360
that I would have gotten to
if we can get through all

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:30.120
of this stuff, which is just
stories about the situation,

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.320
is that the fetish with
home-ownership in this country

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.430
has reduced the capacity
for people to rent.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:41.610
And rentership allows
much greater mobility

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:43.380
than home-ownership.

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:48.240
Home-ownership creates
conservative investment

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.730
in which you don't want
new people to come in.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:54.510
So you limit the building of new
housing, especially affordable

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:58.680
housing, because
the great virtue

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.550
that Herbert Hoover and
Franklin Delano Roosevelt

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:06.840
felt in stabilizing society
through home-ownership

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:14.640
is producing a model whereby
the largest savings you can make

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.130
in your life are the profits
between the cost of your house

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:22.020
on purchase and its sale.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:25.710
And that becomes an enormously
conservative commodity

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.510
that you have to maintain.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:30.660
Do you want a black
family moving next year

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.130
a house in Newton?

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:35.800
Well, Newton is a liberal
suburb, so it wouldn't matter.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.350
But in Des Moines, Iowa?

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:50.300
There have been a number pieces
written on the difficulty

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:55.130
now for young families to move
into certain suburban sectors

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.590
where the suburban
tax base doesn't

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.500
want to spend money
on building schools

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.415
for young immigrant families.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:11.820
So this decentralized, what
Melvin Webber calls the spread

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:18.000
city is not a simple
proposition about having

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.750
free space and unlimited
automobile access.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:31.350
Let me just go through this
sheet of stuff that I gave you.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:41.410
The first is a controversial
piece called "Prove It--

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:44.770
the Costs and
Benefits of Sprawl."

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:48.250
It's by two University
of Southern California

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:56.190
economists who contend some
of the premises of densifying

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:57.330
the American city.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.140
I'm not going to go
through it in detail.

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:05.030
You can read it.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:09.590
It's very well-established
as the counterpoint,

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:11.480
the pro-sprawl argument.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:28.690
After that, just some
newspaper cuttings--

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:30.780
they're now a bit dated.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:35.715
But it argues that the American
house has doubled in size.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:50.760
The automobile numbers
have increased.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:59.800
And whilst the emission
control legislation is worse,

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.330
Lester Thurow's next
piece on the next page

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:10.420
is an antidote to electronic
commerce, the spread

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:14.890
of electronic commerce,
arguing that it's being

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:18.910
counted by diversification.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:23.030
You go to a bookstore now, and
it's a restaurant, as well.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:27.700
One of the unresolved
pieces of this whole puzzle

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:31.720
is how human beings value
face-to-face contact as opposed

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.365
to machine-interposed contact.

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:42.940
Melvin Webber's piece
"Community Without Propinquity,"

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.690
which I'll give
you on Thursday, is

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.400
one of the classic
pieces of writing,

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.850
which argues that,
in the modern city,

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:57.070
you can maintain community
despite distant geography.

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:17.260
And the last piece is a
polemic from the New Urbanists.

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:22.660
Now, given what I said
are some of the problems

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:28.630
of the decentralized city,
let's look at what they offer.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.780
Half of this is untrue.

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.910
It's just lies.

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:38.680
But in the traditional of
architecture pamphleteering,

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.560
it is common to make
statements which,

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.050
if you say them
aggressively enough,

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:46.540
people will believe
them to be true.

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.240
Corbusier was a
master at using words.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.550
"By bringing most of the
activities of daily living

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:59.670
into walking distance, everyone,
but especially the elder,

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.010
gain independence of movement."

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.080
What are we talking about?

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:11.190
The densities that the urbanists
proposed or the developers will

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:15.960
minimize argue
that Americans will

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:25.560
walk seven minutes, at
most, to a destination.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:30.870
At the densities that you build
in a decentralized American

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:33.960
suburban situation,
admittedly, there

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.679
are as many attached
houses in the United States

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:41.370
as there are single houses.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:44.850
You can probably
develop a market

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:50.340
for a video store
and a 7-Eleven.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.020
So the notion that
you can wander

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:56.400
all over the place purchasing
whatever you want to

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.850
is rubbish.

00:34:58.850 --> 00:34:59.960
It's nonsense.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.175
It's just pamphleteering.

00:35:04.175 --> 00:35:05.210
It should be stopped.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:12.650
"By reducing the number and
length of automobile trips"--

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:17.231
how do you reduce the number
and length of automobile trips?

00:35:17.231 --> 00:35:23.150
If it were easy to do,
we'd all be advocating it.

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.495
Well, give me an example.

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:33.101
Were you going to say something?

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:40.450
"By providing
streets and squares,

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:42.580
the pedestrians and
neighbors walking

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:46.420
come to know each other."

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:51.700
There's evidence from
Putnam's work in Bowling Alone

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:55.390
that Americans who
live in apartments

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:57.280
get to know each
other as well as

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.840
people living in houses, that
neighborly relationships are

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:06.940
the same independent of
the condition of the block

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.140
that you live in.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.190
It's probably true that
the poorer you are,

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:11.980
the more you depend
on your neighbors.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.080
So this is nonsense.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.440
"By providing appropriate
building concentrations

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.800
at easy walking
distance from bus stops,

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:32.510
public transit becomes a viable
alternative to the automobile."

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:36.230
We can't finance
the MBTA in Boston

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:40.790
unless we pay enormous
shares of money to--

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:45.290
which probably would be
justified in a decent economy,

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:46.530
but we're not doing it.

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:52.545
So what is the New Urbanist
project for doing this?

00:36:52.545 --> 00:36:57.790
AUDIENCE: So I do think that,
if you are walking distance

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:03.130
from a bus or subway,
you don't need a car.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:08.830
You can [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:10.580
JULIAN BEINART: But
you need enough people

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:15.860
to do it to pay for
the cost of doing it.

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.350
You can't run a public
transportation system

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:20.136
with six people in it.

00:37:20.136 --> 00:37:22.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.110
It's unfortunately true.

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:26.977
It's as true is eating carrots.

00:37:26.977 --> 00:37:30.456
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:32.941 --> 00:37:36.650
As true eating carrots
are healthy for you,

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:37.640
which I don't know.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.525
I don't eat carrots.

00:37:38.525 --> 00:37:41.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.870
But the cost of
public transportation

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:47.270
can only be justified
by seeing it

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:50.750
as a socially important act--

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:55.310
keeping the air cleaner,
having a much greater sense

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:59.060
of belonging to a public, and
so many positive attributes.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:04.220
But you can't do it
at 10 people per acre.

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:10.190
10 people per acre is
a tenth of an acre lot.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:16.640
If your family size is three,
it's 30 people per acre.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.900
30 people per acre
generate one trip.

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:24.170
If your school happens
to be on a subway line,

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:28.715
or you're close enough
to walk, give me a break.

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:33.800
Now, you're trying
to say something.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.360
Tell me what you're
trying to say.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.985
AUDIENCE: No, I agree
with the science.

00:38:36.985 --> 00:38:40.790
It's completely--
it's not possible.

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:47.320
But what I want to say is
that when there is also

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:52.430
easy way for a car [INAUDIBLE]
or moving by car, which I think

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:56.030
is the case in Boston,
then you can choose.

00:38:56.030 --> 00:39:00.590
And it's also-- it's as easy to
move around your car and park

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:03.332
and go on these superhighways
that take you everywhere

00:39:03.332 --> 00:39:03.897
really fast.

00:39:03.897 --> 00:39:04.980
JULIAN BEINART: Of course.

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:07.680
AUDIENCE: Then it's hard to
decide to take the subway.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:11.000
But if you're in New York,
where parking is such a hassle,

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.230
then of course.

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:15.150
JULIAN BEINART: It's a
hassle in Boston, as well.

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:17.203
AUDIENCE: No, but
it's worse in--

00:39:17.203 --> 00:39:18.620
JULIAN BEINART:
In Manhattan, yes.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:21.530
People per capita
walk in Manhattan

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:24.860
more than they do in
any city in the world,

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:30.020
because of the restrictions
on other forms of access,

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.960
although Manhattan is a very
good public transportation

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.940
system.

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:39.690
Well, it improved with the
Second Avenue extension.

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:45.480
Why does Manhattan have
a good subway system?

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.050
London has the best subway
system in the world.

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:50.078
Why?

00:39:50.078 --> 00:39:53.480
AUDIENCE: Because it
was developed first.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.830
JULIAN BEINART: Yes, correct.

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:58.040
In London's case, it
was developed early.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.050
No country in the
world can afford

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:03.710
to build a London
transportation system today.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:09.570
Its way of predictability saved
the society enormous amount

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:10.070
of money.

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:16.070
The subway system and
the bus system in London

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:17.990
cover almost every--

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:20.690
I think the average distance--

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:23.840
I remember saying it when
we talked about London--

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:24.830
is very small.

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:33.500
Density is one of
the argued solutions.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.770
You put more people into
space, the more of them

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:41.270
will likely be clients for
using public transportation.

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:45.290
And there's nothing that helps
public transportation more

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:45.905
than clients.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:57.400
It's such an obvious
algorithm that the difficulty

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.020
is knowing what to do with it.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:02.660
And that's where next--

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.890
the class on Thursday
is going to ask you

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:08.800
to come up with some solutions.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.050
Let's say the following.

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:14.050
American cities are
going to remain largely

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:15.070
automobile cities.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:27.000
Rest of the world will
follow to the extent

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.260
that it can because gasoline
prices in the United States

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:34.920
are a fraction of gasoline
prices in other parts

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:39.210
of the world and the automobile
highway system has been

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:42.630
subsidized by the state
to an enormous degree

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:47.650
under Eisenhower, starting
with Eisenhower, and so on.

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:50.550
We don't pay for the
roads that we use.

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:58.220
A commuter living in Lexington
passing through Cambridge

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:01.670
every morning past
my house doesn't

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:07.130
pay for the cost of maintaining
their street in Cambridge.

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:07.820
It's free.

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:15.680
We've gotten used to
having free automobile--

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:22.910
but to get agreement
in a country

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:25.940
as large as this
takes a lot of--

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.020
can you imagine the opposition?

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.710
I don't know what the
senators from Texas

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:35.060
would vote, in favor
of or against taxation

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:43.180
on automobile use,
because we are

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:46.990
using fuel produced in Texas.

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:53.720
And the automobiles use an
enormous amount of fuel.

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.410
So does most of the
transportation system

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:58.840
in the United States.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:05.830
We service most of our
delivery by truck, not by rail.

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:10.510
We have enormous difficulty
in building rail.

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:13.870
You just need to read about
the controversies in California

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:20.830
at the moment trying to link
San Francisco and Sacramento

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:22.075
on the way to Los Angeles.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:27.850
It passes through Palo
Alto, and there's no place

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:29.215
to put it in Palo Alto.

00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:35.230
And land values are
so high in Palo Alto

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:39.110
that you can't do anything
politically about it.

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:40.985
God only knows how it's
going to be resolved.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:47.350
Anyway, there are
different kinds of suburbs.

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:49.810
The suburbs that originally--

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:57.730
that Levittown was built on had
a daily population of women,

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:01.390
a single car, a station wagon.

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:04.750
A Chevrolet station
wagon's what people had.

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:06.700
They had meatloaf for dinner.

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:10.700
There were no
restaurants and so on.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:14.560
The Organization Man, the
book by William Whyte,

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.640
describes the conditions
in Park Hill--

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.800
not Park Hill.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:24.530
I forget the name of
the suburb of Chicago.

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:29.380
He's in this piece in
your reading list called

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:32.230
"Stressed out in
Suburbia," writes

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:40.090
a description of the suburb,
the new suburb of Naperville,

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:44.950
just further away from Chicago,
where all the restaurants are

00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:49.930
ethnic restaurants, all
the stress in the community

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:51.965
is on children
getting higher grades.

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:06.280
So American suburbs
have grown in wealth.

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.900
Houses are given French names.

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:13.940
The neighborhoods are all
given foreign names and so on.

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:16.830
It's quite amusing.

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:18.640
Let me just pick up
some other things.

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.720
Robert Putnam from
Harvard has written

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:27.580
a book called
Bowling Alone, which

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:31.165
causes a big surge of
interest in social science.

00:45:37.894 --> 00:45:41.740
He claims that what has
happened in the United States--

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:44.530
and he's not blaming
suburbia for it--

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:47.350
is that there's been a much--

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:52.360
strong tendency towards
individualism as

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:56.500
opposed to belonging to
a community or sharing.

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.030
He quotes endlessly.

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:03.505
Religious affiliation
has dropped.

00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:09.480
The United States has more
houses of worship per capita

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:13.430
than any other nation on Earth.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:16.590
There's been a modest decline
in all church-related groups

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:19.200
over the past 20 years.

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.570
Union membership
has been falling

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:23.820
for nearly four decades.

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:27.750
The Parent Teacher
Association has become--

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:34.790
which has always been
an important form

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:37.550
of civic engagement
in 20th century

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:42.050
America, has declined
from 12 million in 1964

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:46.400
to barely 5 million in 1982.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:51.290
Volunteering for traditional
women's groups, the League

00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:54.620
of Women Voters, the
Red Cross, Boy Scouts,

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:56.600
all have dropped in attendance.

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:03.860
He counters that by
talking about groups

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.500
that have increased in size.

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.890
I didn't know this, but
the American Association

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:14.480
of Retired Persons, AARP,
has grown exponentially,

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:21.140
from 400,000 card-carrying
members in 1960 to 33 million

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:27.020
in 1993, becoming, after
the Catholic Church,

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:29.900
the largest private
organization in the world.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:44.360
When he asked in
his social survey

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:48.090
in 1974, "How often do
you spend a social evening

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:49.470
with a neighbor?"

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:52.890
the proportion of Americans who
socialized with their neighbors

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:55.230
more than once a
year has slowly but

00:47:55.230 --> 00:48:03.180
steadily declined over the past
to two decades from 72% to 61%,

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.725
whereas friends who do not
live in your neighborhood

00:48:05.725 --> 00:48:06.975
appears to be on the increase.

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:20.850
Oh, we have some time.

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:22.740
I looked at the wrong
thing on my watch.

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:33.600
The use of the automobile,
in metropolitan terms,

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.308
is interesting in
another respect.

00:48:36.308 --> 00:48:40.700
[DOOR OPENS]

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:41.870
What's--

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:42.912
AUDIENCE: It's 2 o'clock.

00:48:42.912 --> 00:48:44.370
JULIAN BEINART:
Oh, it's 2 o'clock.

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:44.900
I'm sorry.

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.652
I've got a dull watch.

00:48:47.652 --> 00:48:50.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:55.760
I'll continue with some
more evidence for you

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:59.300
to put into your
mincing machine.

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:06.440
But I expect some feedback
as to where you stand.

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:11.610
In the end, maybe it's simply
where you stand that matters.

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:16.070
Many of you architects will
favor densification of the city

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:19.010
despite any notion
of how it can be

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:20.720
achieved in a liberal society.

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:32.340
Maybe an American city is
just like American democracy--

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:36.570
slow and full of pitfalls,
not doing anything about gun

00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:41.118
control when it's
obvious that it should,

00:49:41.118 --> 00:49:43.500
And yet it's survived.
