00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.110
PROFESSOR: So we've just
discussed the strategies

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.270
for reopening schools
and businesses based

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.450
on the indoor safety
guideline for the given

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.890
space and the various physical
parameters in that space.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.610
And the new concept we added
was a prevalence of infection.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.170
So we would know, on average,
how many infected people

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.430
we might expect in a room.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.490
And as that number goes to
zero, as the pandemic subsides,

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.640
we can switch from a
more restricted situation

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.500
with an occupancy
N1, prescribed

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.200
by the original guideline based
on the indoor reproductive

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.630
number, to kind of
increasing occupancy up

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.510
to N0, which is the
normal original occupancy,

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.900
initially with masks.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.360
And as the prevalence
goes down, we

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.640
switch to taking the
masks off and really

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.650
returning back to normal.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.370
So I'd like to take this a
little further now and ask,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.090
how would we change our
policies or this discussion

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.620
here if we not only
have information

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.000
about the prevalence
of infection

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.440
but we also have an
understanding of immunity,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.710
which could be acquired
through vaccination

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.110
or through previous exposure?

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.910
And especially right
now as I'm recording

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.000
this lecture in early
2021 and several vaccines

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.180
have rolled out
for COVID-19, this

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.510
is a topic of great interest.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.590
So let's think
about, how would we

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.000
take into account
susceptibility?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.090
So, in some sense, this
was a conservative estimate

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.610
of the true risk of
transmission because we've

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.360
assumed that everyone who's
uninfected is susceptible.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.570
But, of course, as immunity is
increased in the population,

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.620
we're going to have
to modify that.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.289
So instead of having
our populations

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.960
of susceptible and
infected persons

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.030
being sampled from a two-state
or two-category process,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.070
we can think of
three categories.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.200
There can be--

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.320
PI is the probability
that a person is infected,

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.410
which means really, again,
that they're infectious

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.800
and they can affect
other people.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.840
And this is coming from
the local population that

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.780
is entering that indoor space.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.079
And now we're going to add
PS, which is the probability

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.060
that a person is susceptible.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:30.980
And then the third category is
PM, which is the probability

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.570
that the person is immune.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.010
And so we have a
three-category process,

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.430
so those three
should add up to 1.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.350
So this is 1 minus PI plus PS.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.260
And we can also
further write this

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.160
as PVAC, the probability that
a person has been successfully

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.820
vaccinated and actually
has acquired immunity,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.150
plus the probability
of previous exposure.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.290
We'll call that PX.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.400
So this would be
vaccination, and this

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.370
would be previous exposure
if that previous exposure has

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.420
actually led to immunity.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.360
And that's a controversial
topic, still, under research

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.970
and may depend on the
specific population at hand.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.560
But let's imagine
that we have subsets

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.870
of what these
numbers are and then

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.520
we'd like to see how to
adjust our thinking here.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.400
So we're still going
to base our guideline

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.250
on saying that the expected
number of transmissions

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.440
is the expected number of
infected time susceptible,

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.980
so the expected number of pairs,
times the average transmission

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.050
rate, average of beta
times tau, the time,

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.200
and that that expected
number of transmissions

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.650
should be less than
our tolerance epsilon.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.700
So that's still our guideline.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.070
So what we're really
trying to consider,

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.180
now, are different assumptions
about this expected number

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.360
of infected susceptible
pairs that are in the room.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.730
And we've broken that down
into three risk scenarios.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.230
And let's revisit that, now,
with our three-category model.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:25.820
So the first risk scenario
was describing a desire

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.820
to limit spreading
of the disease

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.480
through this indoor space.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.950
This is our original goal.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.970
And by that, we mean, if
an infected person enters

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.330
the room, then we would like
to make sure that it's unlikely

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.000
that a new case would
emerge from transmission

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.540
from that person.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:50.570
So in that case, we
have I is equal to 1.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.110
And then, now, I is known.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.360
So this is just the
expected value of S.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.900
And the expected value of S,
though, in this new model,

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.730
is the number of other people in
the room, n minus 1, times PS.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.730
So you see, now, when I define
my indoor reproductive number

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:19.460
as N minus 1 times
beta tau and I

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.860
want to bound that to
be less than epsilon--

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.760
that's my typical guideline--
there's this extra factor, PS,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.720
which could be moved
to the other side.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.440
So one way to think about it
is, since PS is less than 1,

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.350
we are increasing that
tolerance because there

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.380
are fewer susceptible people.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.220
So we're allowed to
stay in the room longer,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.070
have a higher occupancy,
lower ventilation, et cetera.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.040
So this is one case.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.150
The next case is to
limit transmission.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.110
So here we're not
going to assume

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.040
that an infected person
actually is there,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.340
but we are going to consider
the possibility that there

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.500
is an infected person there.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.470
So that makes transmission
potentially a lot less likely.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.080
And so what we'd
like to do here is

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.250
to look at the expected
value of I times S.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.710
And I won't go
through the details.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.920
But for the trinomial
distribution

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.080
with three independent
possibilities,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.630
with these
probabilities-- and you're

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.570
making N samples from
that distribution--

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.490
you can show that the
expected value of this product

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:33.490
is actually N minus
1 times PI times PS,

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.830
by very similar
arguments as we have

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.700
done for the binomial case.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.760
One way to think about
this is that N minus 1

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.090
is the number of permutations
of two people that

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.420
can be made in that room.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.470
So if you pick one person
to be first the infected

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.250
and the other one to
be the susceptible,

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.310
this is the number
of such pairs.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.740
And PI PS is the probability
of each of those instances.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:07.530
So this is the expected
number of I to S pairs.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.740
And I put a directionality here
because we are distinguishing

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.760
each individual person.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.890
So if I take two people,
I am counting differently.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.960
If one is infected, the
other one's susceptible

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.430
or the reverse situation since
everyone's a unique individual.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.460
OK, so if we then substitute
into this formula,

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.690
then, notice, now, we've
picked up some extra factors.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.240
So now the guideline
would read that RN

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.110
will be less than epsilon over
N times PI, which is something

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.600
we already had before.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.250
But now there's also a PS.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.970
So that's modified.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.050
And then, finally, our
third risk scenario

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.830
was to limit personal risk.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.290
So this is the case
where S is equal to 1.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.240
I'm only worried about
one susceptible person,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.380
and that's me.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.310
And I'm then-- if
S is known, then

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.580
we just have the
expected value of I,

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:22.090
which is just N minus 1, all
the other people, times PI.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.620
And if you plug that
into the formula,

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.750
then you find that
RN is now bounded

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:33.280
by epsilon divided by PI.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.820
So take into account both
prevalence of infection

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.850
and susceptibility, at least to
these somewhat modified bounds.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.679
And let's focus on where
the changes took place.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.370
So first of all, in
the original guideline

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.580
for limiting spreading, we can
be a little bit more lenient.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.760
So as there's more
vaccination and more immunity,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.860
we don't need to keep
holding that guideline

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.570
at the same level,
even in the most

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:59.640
sort of conservative stance
of trying to limit spreading.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.190
What's more interesting for this
plot here is the middle one.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.860
So now, we again think
up a factor of PS.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.290
But everything else is the same.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.500
So what it means is that,
relative to the calculation

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.800
that I showed here,
I should actually

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.660
make the very same
plot where I don't just

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.730
plot PI in this
axis, but actually

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:19.110
plot PI times PS, where PS
is the probability of being

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.780
susceptible, which is
related to vaccination

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.920
and previous exposure rates.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.100
So that actually does bring this
down and, hence, make it easier

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.500
to make the decision to
relax restrictions and even

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.840
ultimately take off the mask,
because as a combination

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.380
of these two factors, we're
getting even more safe.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.580
Interestingly, down
here for personal risk,

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.000
we don't really care about the
probability of susceptibles

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.250
because the only person I
care about in that situation

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.030
is myself.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.570
And so I don't have any
effect of susceptibility,

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.200
only the effect of infection.
