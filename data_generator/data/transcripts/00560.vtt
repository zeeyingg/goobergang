JULIAN BEINART: The first
sheet on the handout really--

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.650
I forgot to give it
to you last time.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:45.690
It's simply the argument
that for every major ideology

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.540
associated with the
change of a city,

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.830
there's a housing type
which it generates as well.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.130
And this is just a little
sketch of some of the work

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.690
that we've done in the classes--

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.040
London, Paris, Vienna,
Barcelona, Sunnyside Gardens,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.850
and so on.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.350
For those of you who are
interested in architecture,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.390
that should be a help.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.390
There are not many cities which
originated in the 19th century.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.310
Chicago is one of them and
probably the major one.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.025
What was the population
of Chicago in eighteein

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:44.550
[INAUDIBLE] It doesn't matter.

00:01:47.544 --> 00:01:53.640
There were a few Indians
living on a piece of land

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.830
which connects the lake
to the Mississippi River.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:07.380
And Chicago-- I think
it'd be silly to ask you

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.900
what Chicago means.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.615
It's an Indian name for
something, wild garlic.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.820
Many cities have an affection
for nature in their names.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.170
Bang Makok is the Village
of Wild Plum in Thailand.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.410
Mumba Devi is the
godess of fishermen.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.145
What is Boston?

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.560
Saint [INAUDIBLE] town--

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.430
Saint [INAUDIBLE] is the
god of fishermen, I think.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.620
Certainly, Boston comes
from Saint [INAUDIBLE] town.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.750
Now, the extraordinary
thing about Chicago

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.050
is, compared to the cases
we've done up to now--

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.120
number one, that
it has no walls.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.770
Number two, it has no royalty.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.370
It has no invested aristocracy.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.756
What else doesn't it have?

00:03:26.756 --> 00:03:28.596
STUDENT: History?

00:03:28.596 --> 00:03:29.440
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.315
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:31.870
No, you're right.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.550
You're right, absolutely right.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.795
The argument for Chicago has
always been [INAUDIBLE] OK.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.970
Be why we talk about
these generalities.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.770
The second page on your
handout is 100 years

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.860
of building activity in Chicago
done by Homer Hoyt, the man who

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.250
did the [? vector ?] theory
of city form, which we dealt

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.650
with a couple of weeks ago.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.230
This categorizes building
activity in the city.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.550
And we will go through
it stage by stage.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.870
But it's remarkable that we
can depict Chicago's history

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.200
in terms of economic
activity, whereas we

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.020
haven't used that as an index
for any of the other cases.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.180
Chicago is built by
the private sector.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.300
It has no city--

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.960
or such a weak and corrupt
city government that everything

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.740
about Chicago in its
19th-century period,

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:07.180
certainly, was based on the
primacy of the individual

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.730
making his own way
against all odds.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:18.310
Chicago is referred to
as the city of wind,

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.660
not because the wind blows
there but because of the hubris

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.830
of its politicians
and its salesmen.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.410
Wind refers to the
air that's blown out

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.690
of the mouth when you brag.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.050
I will go through
this in more detail.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.670
In 1848, when the railroads
crossed this country

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.660
and made their major
midwestern stop in Chicago

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.390
instead of St.
Louis, which would

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.570
have been a more
direct route, this

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.500
was all because of the
bullshit of politicians.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:11.020
In 1893, when the
Chicago World's Fair

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.400
celebrated 400 years
after Columbus,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.070
it should have
gone to St. Louis.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.225
But it went to Chicago.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.980
Chicago is the only city
in the world which built

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.735
the first skyscrapers on sand.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.560
It's the first city in the
world and the only city

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.540
in the world which built an
illegal subway system, 50

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.670
miles of illegal subway
built by private development

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.470
without the city knowing.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.980
Or if they knew, they
were submerged in bribes.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.790
I will go through all
of these examples.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:08.840
So we can characterize
Chicago adequately

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:21.920
in Park and Burgess's model
of a concentric universe

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.640
in which movement is outwards.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.460
To make it in Chicago,
you need to immigrate.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:37.730
And the immigration zone is
the inner zone of transition.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.590
And then you make it,
and you move outwards.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.620
American cities are primarily
immigrant cities, as opposed

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.405
to European cities.

00:07:49.405 --> 00:07:54.850
And this model, plus
the ethos of Chicago,

00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:01.000
represents, in more stunning
detail, this phenomenon.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.830
I was talking about Frank Lloyd
Wright and one of his clients.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.020
His clients were new.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.010
They were people like the
man who invented the zip.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:18.760
They were people willing
to see technology

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.910
as a possibility
for advancement.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:27.220
People made enormous amounts of
money just by being in Chicago.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.960
I'll go through some
of the real estate

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:34.280
transactions in a few minutes.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.640
So the themes we
can look at and I'll

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.760
try to give some
examples of, how

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.070
the city is an economic engine.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:49.740
The cycles produced through
advancement and setbacks

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.240
in economics has
fascinated cycle theorists

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.290
like Kondratiev and Kuznets
and people of this kind.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.110
But nobody has yet been
able to perfect it.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.450
If you perfected
cycle theory, you

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.030
would be the wealthiest man
in the world, I should think,

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:10.530
or the wealthiest
women in the world.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:16.830
But the free market
system implies risk.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.270
And therefore, a
correct depiction

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.110
of the way Chicago is built
in the free enterprise system

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:30.690
would suggest a diagram
much like Hoyt's diagram.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.526
Secondly, the city and nature--

00:09:35.526 --> 00:09:39.180
there's a wonderful book by
William Cronon called Nature's

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.610
Metropolis about Chicago.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.580
It's worth reading if you
have nothing else to do,

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.070
which is not likely.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.340
But Nature's
Metropolis is written

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.500
by a man who was a
professor at Yale.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.240
And he's now, I think, in
Wisconsin, where he's from.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.820
He's an environmentalist.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.210
And he depicts the
natural state of Chicago,

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:11.160
and its regional hinterland, and
the transformations that occur.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:21.560
To me, nature in
Chicago was something

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.530
that could be improved upon.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.750
As everything else
could be improved

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:32.420
upon through [? manual ?]
labor and intelligence,

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.630
so nature could
be improved upon.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:51.400
Nature could deal with the
consequences of modernism.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.300
I mean, Louis Sullivan,
in Kindergarten Chats--

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.240
his little book,
kindergarten chats--

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.810
Louis Sullivan was one
of the great architects

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:05.290
of the late 19th
century in Chicago.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:11.500
He and his partner, Adler, did
the transportation building

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.490
in the Chicago
World's Fair in 1893.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:21.140
But Sullivan-- when I show
you his auditorium building,

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:27.910
you will read in the
toilets the notion that--

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:28.850
no, no sorry.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:29.350
Forget it.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:32.740
I'm mixing the ideas.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.790
You will see in the
system of decoration

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:41.980
an attempt to maintain
an association

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:49.300
with natural form, much
like Otto Wagner in Vienna.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.680
These are hybrid people.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.740
Louis Sullivan was very angry
at the neoclassical system

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.020
of the Chicago World's Fair.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:05.620
He said it would set back
America considerably.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.250
We'll talk about the
Chicago World's Fair

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.345
later in the class.

00:12:13.565 --> 00:12:15.190
Let's look at some
of the other themes.

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:27.930
The distinction
between the activity

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.510
of the private sector
and the weakness

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.360
of the communal environment--

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:42.420
after the Great Fire of 1871,
there were two responses.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.820
The one was, gee whiz, what an
opportunity to rebuild Chicago

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:47.900
anew.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:52.970
The other one was, we are guilty
because we blasphemed God.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:58.250
Two positions
expressed by optimists

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.020
It was the day after the fire.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.700
There was a-- you will see--

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:08.630
a real estate booth in
the ashes selling land.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:13.160
You get, perhaps, the
starkest interpretation

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:19.250
of this theme in the book The
Devil in the White City by Eric

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.920
Larson, another
book that you need

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.745
to know about if you want
to know about Chicago.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.060
Here, up to 200
women, young women,

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:39.190
are killed by a sociopath
in his hotel, up to 200.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.600
Who know whether it's 200.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:46.160
Nobody ever was able to account
for the number of bodies

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.410
that he either put into
acid vats or burned.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.350
These women just disappeared.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.180
There was no police to
account for who would--

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:06.130
27 million people visited
Chicago for the six months

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.570
that the fair ran.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.720
Women just disappeared.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.760
The only way in which Holmes
was a sociopath was discovered

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:22.340
was because of a private
security insurance

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.620
man in Philadelphia.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:30.350
A man named [? Geyer ?]
started tracing

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:34.280
what was happening
in these deaths,

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.970
in some of the deaths
that were reported to him.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:43.010
The Chicago city and the
Chicago Police were ineffable.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:46.770
So you have this
extraordinary view

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:51.080
of the dark side of an
environment at the same time

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:57.860
as progress is next to what
Burnham called the White City

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.110
as opposed to the Dark City.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:06.050
The White City with this
new Chicago World's Fair.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:13.970
It had its dark side as well,
the [NON-ENGLISH] But the fact

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:18.680
that in a city as late as 1893--

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.160
in Chicago's case, it was
late, it was almost a century

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.220
after it was formed, 70 years--

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:34.430
we could have the private
sector maintaining

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.455
astounding
technological process.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:47.260
I will show you a diagram which
compares the Ferris wheel built

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:53.830
by a young engineer from
Pittsburgh for the Chicago

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.630
World's Fair.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.970
For the first time,
the public could

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:05.050
circulate above the level
of a city and see it.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:08.590
This was more astonishing than
the Eiffel Tower four years

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:15.640
before and, perhaps, even
more astonishing than Tatlin's

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.570
monument to the
Third International.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.740
This is the city which
again defies logic

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:36.450
by building skyscrapers
without foundation.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.060
Well, the foundations
are rafts which

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.240
float on the sand
rather than columns.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.220
There's no rock.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.830
This is the last place in the
world where you would expect

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.750
the genesis of the skyscraper.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:56.710
And the first tall building--

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:02.790
I mean, Otis invented the
elevator, the safety elevator.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:07.349
Before, the elevators had
been used since Roman times.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:11.910
But the safety elevator
means that the elevator,

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:16.285
if it breaks, it has the cable
system which protects the fall.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.650
The first skyscrapers,
probably the--

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:29.352
I will get to that.

00:17:29.352 --> 00:17:35.370
I wanted-- will detail all of
these things as we go along.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:40.710
The Chicago World's Fair
was stolen from St. Louis.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:44.610
St. Louis got the
1904 Olympic games,

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:51.940
the first one held in the
United States and the second one

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.960
in modern times.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:05.550
The first one was 1900 in Paris.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:11.400
The Chicago World's Fair has a
number of extraordinary things

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.380
attached to it.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:20.160
The one is the building of the
grandest environment ever seen

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.600
in this country.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.000
The manufacturer's
building could

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.420
house St. Peter's, St.
Paul's, the pyramids,

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.230
the lot in one building.

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.260
It was massive.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.960
It's extraordinary.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.815
At the same time,
it had a branch

00:18:36.815 --> 00:18:42.060
or a road of 600 feet wide
called the midway, where

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:46.080
the vulgar aspects of
honkytonk American culture

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.040
could be associated with.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:19:00.080
I'll briefly talk about
the idea of the White

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:06.410
City, Reverend Moody's
city in Pullman, Illinois.

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:13.380
What is a Pullman car as opposed
to an ordinary railroad car?

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.960
In a Pullman car,
it's business class.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.350
There are black man
dressed in black uniforms

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:28.080
with white gloves
who carry your bags

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.030
and elevate the
conventional train system.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:47.330
120 trains entered near Chicago,
as early as 1857, each day.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:52.400
Pullman built a new
town at the entrance

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.010
to the southern part of Chicago.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:58.790
You pass Pullman, Illinois
if you came to Chicago

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:03.110
for the World's Fair by train.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:07.070
Pullman, like many
utopianists, tried

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:13.620
to produce a culturally superior
environment for his workers.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.240
And lastly, we'll
look at Burnham's 1909

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:22.490
plan and subsequent attempts
to modify the girth.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:36.340
OK, back to the handout.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:49.510
The first peak,
dated about 1830,

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:54.640
is the building of a
transportation connector,

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:59.810
a canal which connects.

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:03.780
The hypothesis
about Chicago was it

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.720
connected the world's
waterways or could

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.180
connect it was waterways.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:21.610
From the Atlantic, here are the
lakes and a small [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.210
You have the widest
river in the world.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.835
This is not a trivial opening.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.710
It never produced
the effect that it

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:48.870
was destined in the minds
of investors to produce.

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:57.520
There's no traffic which
travels along this route.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.550
But it was a
brilliant hypothesis

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:09.920
which, in 1830, enabled
Chicago to take off.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.060
You can see the peak.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:38.140
The first boom in 1835, land
values increased by 150%

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.960
in two years.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.630
I quote from a journalist.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.360
"I have never seen a
busier place than Chicago

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.140
at the time of my arrival.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:53.410
The streets were crowded with
land speculators hurrying

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.170
from one sale to another.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:23:01.030
A negro dressed in scarlet
bearing a scarlet flag

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:06.310
and riding a white horse with
housing housing of scarlet--

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.020
oh-- was housing
[INAUDIBLE] scarlet

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.210
announced the time of the sale.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.830
At every street corner, the
crowd gathered behind you."

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:22.560
The total land sales,
according to Hoyt in Chicago,

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.600
in 1830 were $168,000.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:32.250
In 1836, it was $10,500,000,
over 60 times in six years.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:41.070
1848, the canal was finished.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:44.220
Chicago was developing as
an agricultural center--

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.700
wheat, and lumber, and the
beginning of manufacturing.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.870
But it was a town, I quote,
"without pavement, sidewalks,

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:58.370
sewers, gaslight,
streetcars, or railroads."

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:02.730
The second boom came
with the decision

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:09.420
to have a railroad
pass through in 1848.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.900
Our chief, ultimate importance
of the canal, the lake,

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.200
traffic, and the plank
woods for a plank roads

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.500
was that they gave Chicago
sufficient advantage

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.790
to attract the railroad.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:24.630
It was important in making
Chicago a great wholesaling

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:28.850
and manufacturing center.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:35.090
In 1836, it took 30 days to
get from Chicago to New York.

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:38.570
In 1849, it took seven days.

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:47.450
In 1852, it took 36 hours.

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:52.760
[INAUDIBLE] the
time construction

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:57.140
between New York and the
Midwest, when being reduced,

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:01.880
amplified the centrality
of Chicago in the Midwest.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:10.830
The slump of 1857,
overspeculation

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:15.960
in Western land,
Michigan Southern stock

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.385
dropped from $88 to $9.

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:29.760
European demand for wheat
in the 1871 Civil War

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.480
meant Chicago kept
economically after.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:41.860
The post-war boom
of 1865 to 1871

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.220
re-established in
Chicago's industrial base.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:51.010
By now, it had manufactured the
largest meat-packing industry

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:58.000
the world had ever seen using
a conveyor belt system which

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.870
Henry Ford, amongst
others, appreciate

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:06.490
and introduced into
his automobile plants.

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:12.332
1871, The Great Fire, one of the
greatest holocausts in history.

00:26:12.332 --> 00:26:15.985
The resurrection is
optimism or blame.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:25.840
1878, the boom, improvement
in the American economic

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:32.170
condition, the first
steel-frame skyscrapers.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:42.870
Home Insurance building, 1884.

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:46.180
Steel-frame [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.570
[INAUDIBLE] building, 1891.

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:50.850
16 floors.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:52.050
So on and so on.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.690
So if you're going
to build the city

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:05.300
through private initiative,
private investment,

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.100
you're going to have
to deal with the cycle

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:13.050
of economic advancement,
and boom, and depression.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:26.550
Chicago managed-- you'll notice
that in the European examples,

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:32.730
post-Engels, I spoke often
about the condition of the poor.

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:36.520
The condition of
the poor was not

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:41.340
an aspect of civic
consciousness in the time

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.980
that I'm talking about.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:46.056
If you went to
Chicago, you made it.

00:27:46.056 --> 00:27:50.280
If you didn't make
it, somehow or other,

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:57.030
you survived, either by crime
or by some other kind of device.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.070
There was no social program.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:05.310
The city didn't exist as an
arbiter of human condition.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:08.115
Human condition followed
what the market produced.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:22.630
The fire of 1871
paralleled the fire of 1666

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:24.040
in London similarly.

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:36.040
I mentioned the illegal building
of a 50-mile set of tunnels

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:42.230
in 1914.

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:51.770
Earlier, the city, in
1890, had given permission

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:58.520
to private building owners
to dig in their basements

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:05.780
to provide insertion
of a telegraphic wire.

00:29:10.226 --> 00:29:14.440
The telegraphic
cable was soon seen

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:19.420
as a ruse for digging mud out
of the basement of your building

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.300
and connecting it.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:25.030
At times, there
was a train which

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:30.310
carried mail and deposited
goods in the basement of Carson

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:34.480
Pririe Scott and Montgomery
Ward, the two biggest modern

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.510
department stores at the time.

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:41.290
It even, at times, produced
ice for air conditioning.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:47.860
It became transportation.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.700
How did the city--

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.740
how did the businessmen
deal with it?

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.670
By bribes, of course.

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:08.280
That was how all business was
done, also by telling lies.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.500
The developers claimed
that they were only laying

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:14.400
cable for a telephone company.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.500
They dug at night
so people would not

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:20.460
notice the amount of dirt being
smuggled away from the scene.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:24.180
They found that the tunnels
were almost 13 feet high.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.660
Part of this was
that two people a day

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:32.180
were being killed in
the city by trains going

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.540
through crowded crossings.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:40.550
But this is the only
example in modern history,

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:47.930
or even in any history, of
the illegitimate building

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:52.610
of a major infrastructure
system underneath the city.

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:54.050
It's a wonderful story.

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:59.150
There's a part of
me which rejoices

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:04.400
in the idea of building
an illegal sub,

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.640
one day waking up
and finding that you

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.450
have a subway system under
your city nobody knew about.

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:13.520
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:17.380
JULIAN BEINART: No, there
was no permission given.

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.450
STUDENT: But why?

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:21.888
JULIAN BEINART: But why what?

00:31:21.888 --> 00:31:25.577
STUDENT: Why did [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:25.577 --> 00:31:27.160
JULIAN BEINART: I
think I've explained

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.470
that the city was inevitable.

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:31.520
The city didn't exist.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:39.320
Local government was
corrupt [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.365
Chicago is known
as the Shock City.

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:48.430
You could get away with
murder, as many people did.

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:56.360
The great murders in the history
of Chicago are not fiction.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:01.145
They're reality that have become
fiction in American violence.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:11.770
The fact that human beings
can do extraordinary things

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:13.060
shouldn't surprise us.

00:32:15.784 --> 00:32:18.850
The building of the pyramids
was as extraordinary,

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:26.200
if not more extraordinary,
investment in human labor

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:32.110
and guile than the illegal
building of a subway system

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.610
in Chicago.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:47.140
Anyway, the other advent
in Chicago of significance

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:51.940
was the attempt to extend
buildings vertically.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.370
Chicago was hardly
the place that one

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:06.950
would expect this to happen.

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:11.180
There was no rock or
significant rock formation

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.785
under the center of the city.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:21.190
You need at least
that support system

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:24.820
unless you can devise an
alternative, which was devised,

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:27.250
of floating buildings
on platforms.

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:34.070
The Home Insurance
building in 1884

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:39.030
was the first building
built out of a steel frame.

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:41.870
Before that, all building was--

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:45.785
by the way, I forgot to mention.

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:51.510
In 1830s, there was a man--

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:56.660
and not an Indian, an
American white man--

00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:02.840
on a canoe on the Chicago River.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.140
He invented something which
transformed the building

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:07.670
industry of the United States.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:25.620
Well, he devised a system for
manufacturing wooden housing

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:30.810
by using a balloon-frame system
instead of a post and beam.

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:35.370
A balloon-frame system uses
two-by-fours or two-by-tens

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:40.380
and make them into panels which
become the sides of houses,

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:46.710
as opposed to the historic
system of erecting posts

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:51.480
and then spanning
the space with beams.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.630
This man revolutionized the
construction of housing.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:58.610
And he's little known.

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:01.380
He should be known more widely.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:06.480
Because since then,
the pervasive building

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.450
of single-family
wood construction

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:14.765
has manifested itself as a major
economic force in the United

00:35:14.765 --> 00:35:15.265
States.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:21.960
Anyway, back to the skyscraper.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:33.430
Under 20 floors of height,
a tall building [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:37.810
needs to worry about its own
weight and, to a small extent,

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:39.280
about wind.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:43.690
Above 20 floors, wind
becomes the major factor

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:50.140
in the construction resistance
that you provide to the wind.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.450
These buildings are
all under 20 floors.

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:58.795
Frank Lloyd Wright proposed
a building a mile high.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:09.810
What was he thinking about?

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:13.230
What did he have in mind?

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:15.650
He wasn't a foolish man.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:28.795
I'm not quite sure I know, nor
do I know that anybody knows.

00:36:28.795 --> 00:36:30.760
The [INAUDIBLE]
building, at that time,

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:37.265
would have been so outside
of any technical calculation

00:36:37.265 --> 00:36:37.765
system.

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:49.010
The fact that you may be able
to wrap a city in one building

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:50.030
is interesting.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:52.880
The John Hancock
building in Chicago--

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.830
who knows Chicago well?

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.930
Do you know the John
Hancock building?

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:05.750
The John Hancock building,
except for industry,

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:08.630
has all the artifacts of
a city in one building.

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:28.470
There's parking, shopping,
offices, and housing.

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:41.300
Accomplishing this
one in Chicago,

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.550
much later than
Frank Lloyd Wright,

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:53.040
perhaps suggests a remodel
that he had in mind

00:37:53.040 --> 00:38:04.230
for building a Usonian
utopia vertically.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:09.270
Frank Lloyd Wright built a small
office building in Oklahoma.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.900
What was the uniqueness
of his building,

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:19.351
the small building in Oklahoma?

00:38:19.351 --> 00:38:22.818
Do you know?

00:38:22.818 --> 00:38:27.730
It's the only office
building at its time

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:31.500
that had offices and
housing on the same floor.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.825
Here, the separation
is vertical.

00:38:51.208 --> 00:38:53.320
I've got to watch
out for the time.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.420
It is long.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.380
Chicago's a long and
interesting convoluted story.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:59.940
I'm trying to untangle it.

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:29.310
I'd rather leave this
out, but question

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:37.260
as to whether land speculation
in the form of a grid

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:43.410
is a vehicle of
capitalism is arguable.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:47.320
I've written, disagreeing
with Mumford and Richard

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:51.300
[? Sennett, ?] two formidable
opponents, on this premise.

00:39:54.630 --> 00:40:00.480
Mumford, for instance,
says resurgent capitalism

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.330
treats the individual lot,
and the block, the street,

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:08.820
and the avenue as abstract
units for buying and selling.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:13.200
The rectangular street and block
system projected indefinitely

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:17.760
towards the horizon was the
first universal expression

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.760
of capitalistic fantasies.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.350
Each lot being of uniform shape
became a unit like a coin,

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:29.950
capable of ready
appraisal and exchange.

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:35.310
Yeah, that means you can buy
a piece of land in Florida

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:38.880
without seeing it.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.560
I suppose that is possible.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:44.520
But with the grid
system reducing

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:53.210
the complexity of investment
to a unit is all that goes on.

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:56.110
What about [INAUDIBLE] plan?

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:59.210
Here's a man who made an
infinite-- the largest housing

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:03.110
environment in the
world, history.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:10.010
By using a 113-meter by
113-square-block system,

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:14.720
with infinite variables in
it, not built, but according

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:18.970
to him, to his plan.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:20.560
Is that a capitalism?

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:26.320
Is that a result of capitalism?

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.220
The other example, one
of the largest buildings

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:33.965
of mass housing, is in
Soweto in South Africa.

00:41:33.965 --> 00:41:36.835
It's nothing to do
with the market at all.

00:41:36.835 --> 00:41:42.320
It was built by a white
government enforcing its power

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:42.820
on--

00:41:46.938 --> 00:41:49.480
STUDENT: Well, it actually makes
me think of James C. Scott's

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.190
argument about
seeing like a state,

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:55.540
and how states want to
simplify things, and, I mean,

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.580
how capitalism uses
those [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.410
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah,
I think he's right.

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:00.790
Capitalism does.

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:05.080
If I buy an IBM share, I'm
buying one-hundred-thousandth

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:08.410
of its typewriters
and a hundred-thousand

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:11.525
of its elevators and so on.

00:42:11.525 --> 00:42:12.025
Yes.

00:42:12.025 --> 00:42:15.100
And of course, that's
understandable.

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:21.340
But whether-- in a city, a
grid system adjacent to a river

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.170
is a good deal
different from a grid

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:27.400
system adjacent to a mountain.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.730
They are natural deformations.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:35.080
And it's not as easy to--

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:40.900
what Mumford is saying is
that in the case of Chicago,

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:44.860
there was no care
given to the modulation

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:49.330
of the size of blocks to who
developed where, and how,

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:49.990
and so on.

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:55.850
He's, in fact, saying
that the free enterprise

00:42:55.850 --> 00:43:00.620
system has invaded the spatial
property of a complex city

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:03.110
and reduced it to barrenness.

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:11.120
It's an intriguing
proposition, which I have--

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.080
you know, Boston doesn't
have a grid system.

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.600
And there's been as
much speculation in land

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.170
in Boston as there
has been in Chicago.

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:21.310
So give me a break.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:30.210
Those of you who
are designers should

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:34.050
stop thinking in terms of
the geometry of things,

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:38.150
in terms of simple outcomes.

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:40.660
STUDENT: I think that's
true in the long term.

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:43.530
But in the short term,
I know specific examples

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:47.580
where a community can't get
a grocery store because it's

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:51.510
an old non-grid layout,
and grocery stores only

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:53.320
want squares or rectangles.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.580
And so there, you have--

00:43:56.580 --> 00:44:01.755
it's not because of capitalism,
but temporary market norms,

00:44:01.755 --> 00:44:04.748
development norms
realted to the grid.

00:44:04.748 --> 00:44:06.290
JULIAN BEINART: What
about Manhattan?

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:08.310
STUDENT: Yeah, It's
not always true.

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:10.310
But it's true of
some [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:14.090
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah,
I always get out

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:17.750
of this by saying cities are
more complicated than I know.

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:20.655
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:44:20.655 --> 00:44:22.280
JULIAN BEINART:
There's a juxtaposition

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:26.990
between the market,
and between capitalism,

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:30.590
and goodness of outcomes.

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:36.050
It's like saying the
American Express introduced

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:38.510
the traveler's check
for the first time

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:40.880
at the Chicago Exposition.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:47.510
And there were new foods,
things like fast food and so on.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:52.580
Is capitalism to blame for
producing these innovations?

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:56.660
Was capitalism to blame for--

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.320
I don't know.

00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:03.740
I think it's-- it strikes
me as being too elementary.

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:07.250
Richard Sennett, on the other
hand, has another argument.

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:10.230
I don't have time to go into it.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:14.270
I want to spend a few minutes
on the World's Fair and then--

00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:23.680
the World's Fair,
in many respects,

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.590
was fundamental in
the history of Chicago

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:29.395
and, perhaps, fundamental in the
history of the United States.

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:37.110
The Crystal Palace, which is my
favorite 19th-century building,

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:42.450
produced a slew of
exhibitions in Paris.

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:51.672
1851, the Crystal Palace;
1855, 1868, 1889, 1900--

00:45:51.672 --> 00:45:56.920
five exhibitions
between 1855 and 1900.

00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:07.530
They were all there to promote
technology, newness, modernism,

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:09.270
and the market.

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:11.520
There was no
internet, obviously.

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:16.020
The availability
of information--

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.300
there was no telephone.

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:26.760
So this was almost back
to Neanderthal times.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:30.000
So you needed
these great events.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.830
The Crystal Palace
had pieces of India

00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:37.020
in the first part
of the exhibition.

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:50.990
The Crystal Palace genesis
found its last major output

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:57.810
in the 1900 Fair in
Chicago, at least in Paris.

00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:04.970
But in 1893, seven years before
Paris, this enormous task

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:17.330
of building an environment
which would be so impressive, so

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:23.060
capitalizing on the energy
that Chicago could generate--

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:26.420
if Chicago could build a
skyscraper-- at the time,

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:31.040
in 1893, there were really
20 skyscrapers in New York.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.240
They had the big
department stores.

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:41.855
They had mass methods of
producing meat and food.

00:47:41.855 --> 00:47:46.490
They had enormous grain
towers on the water or next

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:48.908
to the water.

00:47:48.908 --> 00:47:52.610
The idea of having
to make something

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:56.430
which manifests itself--

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:58.730
the second problem
with an exhibition

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:01.310
is that it only
lasts a short time.

00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:03.770
It's, of course, an
enormous advantage

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:08.150
in that you can risk
building a building which

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:14.390
is more likely to be thrilling
and dangerous than any before.

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:20.150
The story of the Ferris
wheel is a fantastic story.

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:24.140
There was a competition
for a vertical element.

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:28.520
The Eiffel Tower, in
1889, had dramatized

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:31.670
the idea of an exhibition.

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.980
Let me just draw this.

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:45.160
Chicago faced the competition
of the Eiffel Tower.

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:53.530
In fact, the competition which
was held, produced, [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:55.440
fantastic entries.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:01.600
[INAUDIBLE] wanted to build
a glass umbrella covering 193

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:07.780
acres, four times
larger than St. Peter's.

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:15.730
[? Proctor ?] wants to build a
tower 1,150 feet high, 150 feet

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:17.240
higher than the Eiffel Tower.

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:23.700
The competition was
considered a failure.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:26.940
Eiffel was contacted and asked
whether he would come and do

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.710
something as well.

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:32.610
This is a stark admission
on the part of Chicago

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:35.130
that anybody else in the
world could do better.

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:40.890
Somebody revived the idea
of one of the entries

00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:43.860
in the competition
by this young man,

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:47.400
Ferris, who had
proposed that you

00:49:47.400 --> 00:50:05.880
could create a vertical
system, in this case--

00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:16.510
I don't know what its height--

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:27.790
a system which could do
what the Eiffel Tower--

00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:30.790
and I may as well
do Tatlin's Tower.

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:36.490
It was never built--

00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:59.545
that you could create an
environment which moved.

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:25.210
36 cars-- the
engineering consequences

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:28.990
of putting people into cars
and then twisting them,

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:32.980
twirling them around in
the air, was significant.

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:37.450
No wonder the Ferris wheel
was considered too dangerous.

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:42.250
And they actually had
to build a model of it.

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:43.600
Well, it's not a model of it.

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.450
They built it,
finally, and tested it.

00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:50.440
And to everybody's surprise,
but not to Ferris' surprise,

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.970
it actually worked.

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:55.880
It ran and provided
a view of Chicago

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.220
which people h ad never had.

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:07.240
The Ferris wheel was located
not in the main space

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.000
of the exposition.

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:17.930
A significant notion
about the exhibition,

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:22.010
it had the Court of Honor of
these buildings on either side.

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:32.060
You came in by train,
connected to the water

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:39.470
here through a gate, secondary
buildings along here,

00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:40.010
the idea--

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:49.160
at right angles to
this, 600 meters--

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.900
600 feet in width.

00:52:53.792 --> 00:52:55.555
It was something
called the Midway.

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.370
The Midway was first
going to be headed

00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:06.215
by a man called
[? Putnam, ?] who

00:53:06.215 --> 00:53:10.670
was an anthropologist
from Harvard University.

00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:15.200
He was going to use
this environment

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:21.770
to depict the human species
in anthropological terms.

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:25.730
He was proposing building a
model of a man and a woman

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:33.660
based on extracting images
from 224 samples of Americans--

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:36.530
something crazy,
all kinds of stuff.

00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:47.390
For some reason or other,
Burnham and these people

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:54.230
decided that this was going
to be boring and stupid.

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:57.095
They brought in a man
called Sol Bloom who

00:53:57.095 --> 00:54:06.620
was a 25-year-old showman from
San Francisco who had already

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:11.390
produced shows which
brought in Egyptian women

00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:18.410
from dances from Egypt and sold
them to American audiences.

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:24.990
Sol Bloom projected
an environment in here

00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:34.780
which had Algerian,
Egyptian, foreign

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:38.620
to the American population.

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:44.950
And the Eiffel Tower is located
here, and not in here at all.

00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:47.830
So this was the White City.

00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:52.060
And this is the city of the--

00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:58.450
Octavio Paz says
Americans go to Mexico

00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:05.710
to fulfill the deep
recesses of depression,

00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:08.620
something of this kind.

00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:11.650
There is a wonderful piece,
written many years ago,

00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:15.430
called The Social
Uses of the Slum,

00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:23.590
arguing that the slum provides
illegal advantages to people

00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:26.020
who live outside
it and don't pay

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:30.850
the costs of the
existence of the slum.

00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:38.110
So you get the idea that there
are two sides to America.

00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:43.360
There's the side of
the establishment

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:47.300
of the symbols of power.

00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:48.550
These buildings are bigger.

00:55:48.550 --> 00:55:50.530
The Manufacturer's
building is bigger

00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:53.950
than anything in history.

00:55:53.950 --> 00:56:01.780
[INAUDIBLE] is important
ways of entering.

00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:10.800
And this is just at
the road, next to which

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.920
are the strangest
things in the world--

00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:21.000
not strange anthropologically,
but strange entertainment-wise.

00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:37.800
Issues of sexism and racism
clouded America at the time.

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:42.810
1904, the first Olympic
games in St. Louis,

00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:45.720
anthropologists
wanted to measure--

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.640
he wanted a day
in which he wanted

00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:53.100
to measure why Black men
ran faster than white men.

00:56:53.100 --> 00:57:01.810
The Chinese-- I could quote
you from the Chicago newspapers

00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:05.030
about the Chinese.

00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:13.700
Just assume that America
had not liberated itself.

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:18.620
This is premodern America.

00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:21.920
It had not liberated itself
from the crutches of--

00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:29.670
there was a Woman's Building.

00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:35.700
This was not the first time that
a Woman's Building was built.

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:41.130
A Woman's Building was built
in the Philadelphia exhibition

00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:43.376
20 years before.

00:57:43.376 --> 00:57:46.920
There's something interesting
about the Woman's Building,

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.620
which was a fairly
large building designed

00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:53.070
by a 21-year-old woman.

00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:58.130
There was a kind of competition
which 13 women entered.

00:57:58.130 --> 00:58:02.580
Only eight women had graduated
from architecture schools

00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:06.570
between '78 and '93.

00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:13.110
They were Syracuse,
[? Cooper ?] Union, MIT.

00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:17.790
The competition was won by a
21-year-old MIT graduate called

00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:22.110
Sophia Hayden, H-A-Y-D-E-N.

00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:24.840
Sophia Hayden had a tough time.

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:30.850
She wanted to depict a
modern environment for women.

00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:34.720
The people who were paying
the money in Chicago,

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:40.680
the ladies wanted to have a
decorative interior filled

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:43.530
with all of the
fashionable items

00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:46.710
that women had in their lives.

00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:50.010
Sophia Hayden
suffered a breakdown.

00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:56.950
And her story's well told
in the book by [INAUDIBLE]..

00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:10.110
On the story of
Holmes, the sociopath,

00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:16.020
you have to read the book to get
the nuances of this man's guile

00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:24.180
and how he managed to offer
accommodation in his hotel

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:27.060
to young women
visiting the fair.

00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:31.680
If there was a black part
opposite to the White City,

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:34.020
it would be this.

00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:36.480
I quote from his book.

00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:43.220
This is after the police had
investigated the problem.

00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:49.040
The earliest phase
of the investigation

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:53.510
began when the police, holding
their flickering lanterns high,

00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:57.710
entered the hotel basement,
a cavern of brick and timber

00:59:57.710 --> 01:00:02.150
measuring 50 feet by 165 feet.

01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:04.820
The discoveries came quickly--

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:09.260
a vat of acid with eight
ribs and part of a skull

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:12.770
settled at the bottom
of mounds of quicklime,

01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:18.530
a large [INAUDIBLE] and a
dissection table stained

01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:20.540
with what seemed to be blood.

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:24.800
They found surgical tools and
[INAUDIBLE] high-heeled shoes,

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:29.530
bones, 18 ribs from the torso
of a child, and so on and so on.

01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:40.840
The book is an
intriguing examination

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:49.660
of what disasters could
befell a city which

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:54.970
was advocating, at the same
time, these kind of displays,

01:00:54.970 --> 01:00:56.710
not only for its--

01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:59.170
I mean, Americans had
never seen anything

01:00:59.170 --> 01:01:03.280
as ordered as in this
environment in 1893.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.300
There are stories.

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:11.290
There are books of reports of
letters written by grandmothers

01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:16.450
coming from Idaho or somewhere
to the World's Fair, entering

01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:20.530
the Court of Honor
at night and fainting

01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:24.610
because they'd never seen
anything made by human beings

01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:25.670
quite that way.

01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:32.140
The other story which
I think is interesting

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:36.010
is the story of Pullman,
Illinois, the attempt

01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:44.015
to build a new town for workers
to build these new railway

01:01:44.015 --> 01:01:44.515
cars.

01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:56.140
It was an environment which
much paternalism involved itself

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:56.860
in--

01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:59.950
that is, to create an
environment in which

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:06.010
the workers would have a higher
level of culture and education

01:02:06.010 --> 01:02:09.610
as a result of
living in this town.

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:13.900
Pullman wouldn't allow
people to purchase houses.

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:18.880
He believed that they would
become selfish and indulgent.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.440
He attempted to provide--

01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:30.220
he produced the Hotel
Florence in the center

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:36.460
with Black waiters, a
multipurpose arcade containing

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:38.840
the town's post office,
the Pullman loan.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:42.790
and savings bank, the
arcade theater, the library,

01:02:42.790 --> 01:02:44.820
and others.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:49.390
In fact, there is an element
of the need to civilized people

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:53.560
according to the norms
of somebody, the owner.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.300
In Frank Lloyd
Wright [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:59.800
projects [INAUDIBLE] talks
about Beethoven being played

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:04.060
in the street or wherever.

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:07.930
Shakespeare, in the
upper part of the arcade,

01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:11.710
was meant to appease
these workers who

01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:15.730
couldn't have prostitutes,
who weren't allowed alcohol,

01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:20.410
and were divorced, and had
to exchange the good life

01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:23.800
as destined by
Pullman, who was making

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.320
a lot of money out of them.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.660
The workers revolted,
and the National Guard

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:39.750
was called in in 1894,
and Pullman was destroyed.

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:47.100
In 1909, Daniel Burnham, who
was the architect and manager

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:52.770
of the Columbian Exposition,
was asked by the City Business

01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:56.700
Club, later become the
City Planning Commission,

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.850
to make a plan for Chicago.

01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:02.790
I will show you and discuss
it when we look at the slides.

01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:14.050
I think let's leave
time for a little

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:17.930
looking at these illustrations.

01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:24.810
There subsequently was a plan
done by a German immigrant,

01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:33.680
[INAUDIBLE] in 1950 to
reconstruct the grid

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:38.840
system by cutting of
some of the grids.

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:42.120
Maybe I didn't explain
things fully enough.

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:47.450
Is there anything in this
series of sagas, and hypotheses,

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:53.750
and stories, and events
that intrigues you

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:55.430
that I haven't explained fully?

01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:02.710
No?

01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:03.370
OK.

01:05:03.370 --> 01:05:06.070
Well, then, I've
done a good job.

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:10.810
The wild garlic piece of
land between the Lac des

01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:15.970
Ilinois and the
Mississippi River

01:05:15.970 --> 01:05:19.810
is the genesis of
the city of Chicago.

01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:24.190
Its history of development
is best explained

01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:26.080
by Hoyt's analysis.

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:26.580
Next.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:39.060
Here's the river and the
first layout of blocks.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:43.690
That's a view of
the town in 1845.

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:44.190
Next.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.933
This is after the railroad.

01:05:53.110 --> 01:05:55.845
Next.

01:05:55.845 --> 01:06:02.800
The fire which, again, as
in London, starts with ships

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:05.485
and eliminates this
large black area--

01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:16.100
one of the major urban
fires in history.

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:16.600
Next.

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:23.645
Through the flames and
beyond, as it was and as

01:06:23.645 --> 01:06:26.505
it is, Wells and Company.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:38.140
Post-fire, a real estate agent.

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:38.640
Next.

01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:47.630
Chicago kept on spreading.

01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:50.460
This is 1893.

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:50.960
Next.

01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:58.670
The [INAUDIBLE] building,
I think about 20 floors

01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:59.655
in height.

01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:14.150
The traction system for
use in the [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:16.920
in the meatpacking industry.

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:17.420
Next.

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:23.890
Some people argue
that the French,

01:07:23.890 --> 01:07:27.010
the Parisian exhibitions
had to produce

01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:31.460
all the technology which wasn't
available in the city itself.

01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:35.500
Some people argued the
Chicago World's Fair

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:43.150
had all of these infrastructure
already in existence

01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:44.420
in the city itself.

01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:47.610
Next.

01:07:50.460 --> 01:08:00.070
This is the ladies toilets
of the Auditorium building.

01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:06.270
Here is a city, and this
is part of Louis Sullivan's

01:08:06.270 --> 01:08:07.260
decorative system.

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:21.109
a city which is rough
and speeding along

01:08:21.109 --> 01:08:23.420
has another aspect to it.

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:26.000
You could argue that
cities should first

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.840
make money and then
reculture themselves.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:35.810
The first [INAUDIBLE]
argued in the Third World

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:40.580
economic environment
that first, make cities.

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:45.680
For instance, an alternative
to [? Chandigarh ?]

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:49.310
was presented as a
city of mud growing,

01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:52.670
eventually, into a city of gold.

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:57.140
The images is that
the important thing

01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:02.370
is to establish the economic
system, make it work.

01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:07.460
And then invest in the
superficial aspects

01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:10.580
or the superior
aspects of culture.

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:14.240
Here, in a city in
which there aren't

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:17.960
proper streets, in which people
get killed in the street,

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:23.779
get killed anywhere else, here
is the cultural contribution.

01:09:23.779 --> 01:09:31.685
This is what the new
middle class need to enjoy.

01:09:31.685 --> 01:09:32.185
Next.

01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:43.800
The part of the Colombian
exhibition which involved

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:49.649
the Court of Honor, the
major buildings on the flank

01:09:49.649 --> 01:09:55.800
and the electricity building,
the [INAUDIBLE] building

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:59.850
[INAUDIBLE] administration,
entry by train,

01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:05.190
the base and statue of
the Republic, the harbour,

01:10:05.190 --> 01:10:06.000
and so on.

01:10:08.765 --> 01:10:09.265
Next.

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:23.120
The Woman's Building, you
can see the Midway Plaisance

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:29.900
in the distance with
the Ferris wheel

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:36.620
in position, as opposed to
the neoclassical facades

01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:43.170
of the old part
of the exhibition.

01:10:43.170 --> 01:10:43.670
Next.

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:56.080
Extraordinary historical
devices-- the crescent,

01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:01.535
the arch, the
isolated sculpture.

01:11:01.535 --> 01:11:02.035
Next.

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:15.880
Louis Sullivan and Adler's
Transportation building whilst

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:21.130
Sullivan rejected
the neoclassicism

01:11:21.130 --> 01:11:23.050
of this exhibition.

01:11:23.050 --> 01:11:27.640
He nevertheless had
enough attraction to it

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:28.660
to build this building.

01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:35.500
The Administration
building, with a dam

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:39.380
which is larger than the
Capitol in Washington.

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:39.880
Next.

01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:44.220
Sorry, I made a mistake.

01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:47.300
This is a Woman's
Building by Sophia Hayden.

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:50.000
In the interior of
the Woman's Building,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.360
a mixture of new
electrical equipment

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:58.730
for the modern kitchen
and half-nude women

01:11:58.730 --> 01:12:03.680
dressed up in drapery as the
other half of the woman's life.

01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:07.050
Next.

01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:14.020
Ferris wheel.

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:25.160
And you can see the Austrian
village, the Algerian,

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:34.330
the Moorish Palace, the street
of Cairo, the German village,

01:12:34.330 --> 01:12:36.915
the Javanese village.

01:12:36.915 --> 01:12:37.415
Next.

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:47.950
That's Sol Bloom, a
little older than 25.

01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:49.570
Next.

01:12:49.570 --> 01:12:53.350
There's a kind of
hybridity in looking

01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:56.500
at the history of cities.

01:12:56.500 --> 01:13:00.820
You could argue that
almost any city in motion

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:05.980
will produce hybrid
versions of situations.

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:11.320
We've had a hybrid version
of the independent woman--

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:16.720
on the one hand, dressed up as
a nude model; on the other hand,

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:19.655
percolating over a new
toaster in the kitchen.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.760
The same with the
American psyche--

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.030
what do you go and see, the
largest manufacturing building

01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:31.140
in the world?

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.630
Or come and enjoy
yourself seeing

01:13:33.630 --> 01:13:38.310
the exotics of Cairo street?

01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.810
Next.

01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:48.710
It all ends very quickly with
fires, one in the cold storage

01:13:48.710 --> 01:13:52.640
environment, another in the
Manufacturer's building.

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:56.150
And this whole place is ruined.

01:13:56.150 --> 01:13:59.570
And it's back to scratch.

01:13:59.570 --> 01:14:00.070
Next.

01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:07.110
Pullman, Illinois,
the Florence Hotel

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:10.620
on the right with
the clock tower,

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:17.305
the typical plan of an
industrial manufacturing town.

01:14:17.305 --> 01:14:17.805
Next.

01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:24.890
The Arcade, perhaps one
of the earliest shopping

01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:27.860
centers in the United States.

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.990
Next.

01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:34.520
1894, the workers and
the National militia

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:37.725
are called out to
protect Pullman.

01:14:37.725 --> 01:14:38.225
Next.

01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:47.030
Burnham, on the extreme left,
at the City Business Club

01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:57.522
and his plan to create a girdle
around the city, six miles out,

01:14:57.522 --> 01:15:00.560
and to diagonalize
the grid where

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:06.050
possible with diagonal systems,
leading to a newly created

01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:14.540
center civic promenade and
a large cultural enterprise

01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:17.685
along the waterfront
and the harbor.

01:15:17.685 --> 01:15:18.185
Next.

01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:34.000
Originally, all the railroads
would follow the same pattern,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.780
entering the center of the city.

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:43.840
The park system would
be greenery located

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:48.485
in [INAUDIBLE] system.

01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:52.120
Next.

01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:07.910
Burnham had large
drawings of Paris.

01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:16.020
Haussmann was a long
time in advance.

01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:21.210
But neoclassical Paris was what
Burnham was using as a model.

01:16:24.490 --> 01:16:24.990
Next.

01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:35.980
This is the German
urbanist, [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:42.160
attempt to revise
the grid system

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:48.070
by cutting it in to
different systems,

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:50.650
breaking it up in
places, leaving it

01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:53.380
where it is in
places, instituting

01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:56.500
a different [INAUDIBLE]
in some places,

01:16:56.500 --> 01:17:00.160
and really revamping
the whole system.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:05.230
He was also attracted
by [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:05.230 --> 01:17:12.040
tall office building
and residential towers

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:15.110
as a proposition.

01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.610
Next.

01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:23.340
And the last of this is
Mario Gandelsonas' book

01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:29.210
The Urban Text, an attempt to
take the grid and the river

01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:39.260
and to reframe it, is best I
can put it, as a set of steps

01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:44.300
that you take in reconstructing
the deep structure of this grid

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:49.670
and river into systems
that look like that.

01:17:49.670 --> 01:17:57.770
Peter [? Eisenman ?] used the
system in studios at Harvard.

01:17:57.770 --> 01:18:01.010
If we have a chance at
one of the next classes,

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:04.390
I will show some of that work.

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:08.840
It's a set of--

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.790
it's based on the
notion that you

01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:15.740
can dig deeply into
of an environment,

01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:19.640
reconstruct it, and
re-elementize it

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.860
in a new way, which is that.

01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:24.020
I don't know what
the hell it means.

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.840
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:30.230
JULIAN BEINART: It has
no practical value.

01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:32.450
You should look at the
book The Urban Text

01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:34.220
and decide on your own.

01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:35.360
I'll give you my opinion.

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:47.260
Chicago is now considered as
one of the greenest cities

01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:48.135
in the United States.

01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:56.784
What does that mean?

01:18:56.784 --> 01:18:59.024
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:59.024 --> 01:19:00.535
JULIAN BEINART: Sorry?

01:19:00.535 --> 01:19:04.235
STUDENT: The green spaces
are mostly private.

01:19:04.235 --> 01:19:06.110
JULIAN BEINART: Does it
matter what they are?

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.530
Certainly not as far as
the environment, the air,

01:19:14.530 --> 01:19:17.220
and pollution is concerned.

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:20.850
If you privatized all
the roofs of buildings

01:19:20.850 --> 01:19:24.450
and made them green, you'd
have an enormous effect

01:19:24.450 --> 01:19:28.650
on the energy output in a city.

01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:40.160
I'll just leave--
if you want to,

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:43.840
I'll give you the reference
to the study which

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:47.345
posits Chicago is the greatest
city in the United States.

01:19:50.170 --> 01:19:53.466
It's largely the greening
of the roofs of buildings.

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:01.475
Chicago can do anything.

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:08.620
It's an example of a
city as an artifact which

01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:13.270
manufactures-- re-manufactures
itself almost at will,

01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:16.165
just through a kind
of sense and will.

01:20:19.084 --> 01:20:21.780
I mean, that sense of will--

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:24.570
STUDENT: How much
of that will gets

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:27.930
lost once the city
becomes institutionalized?

01:20:27.930 --> 01:20:30.150
JULIAN BEINART: A lot.

01:20:30.150 --> 01:20:34.080
You just can't bribe
your way through.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:36.990
No, absolutely.

01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:41.460
Chicago as a story is
a story of free will.

01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:45.990
Anybody coming in from anywhere
making it, and behaving

01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:48.073
like an important person.

01:20:48.073 --> 01:20:50.240
STUDENT: There's a sense
of rapaciousness in the DNA

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:50.907
that you showed.

01:20:50.907 --> 01:20:55.020
JULIAN BEINART: Absolutely,
absolutely, absolutely.

01:20:59.830 --> 01:21:04.060
The social cost of the
free-sector environment was

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:07.090
slowly picked up
as the country--

01:21:07.090 --> 01:21:08.275
I mean, this was a pretty--

01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:20.840
[INAUDIBLE] I was
trying to think

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:23.240
of the percentage
of Black people

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:27.240
in this country who still
live below the poverty line.

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:32.210
I think [? 16%, ?] or 50%
of the Black population

01:21:32.210 --> 01:21:38.780
lived below the
poverty line in 2013.

01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:43.160
This is from William Julius
Jones' work at Harvard.

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:45.680
And the statistics
are borne out.

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:49.700
This country has never
caught up with the capacity

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:53.510
to socialize poverty.

01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:56.570
It's assumed that--

01:21:56.570 --> 01:21:59.960
Mitt Romney is an arch
example of somebody

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:05.210
who believes that the free
market system will eventually

01:22:05.210 --> 01:22:10.400
produce enough social
benefit to take

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:12.610
care of the exaggerations
of the market.

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.780
I don't know what else to say.

01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:22.400
It's such a big generalization.

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:26.990
We'll come into it
later in this class.

01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:33.470
Certainly, the European cities,
from Engels onwards, face the--

01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:35.570
and the Communist
Party never had

01:22:35.570 --> 01:22:39.830
any leverage in this country.

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:42.380
The trade union
movement in this country

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:44.630
doesn't resemble the
British trade union

01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:47.795
movement in any way at all.

01:22:47.795 --> 01:22:52.670
The British trade union movement
educates people in voting,

01:22:52.670 --> 01:22:54.755
for instance.

01:22:54.755 --> 01:22:57.560
The American trade
union movement is--

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:03.400
half of the American South
doesn't involve the trade union

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.140
anyway.

01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:09.550
And that's where most of the new
automobile manufacturing plants

01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:11.190
are going.
