00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.400
PROFESSOR: So welcome to our
Massive Open Online Course,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.550
10.S95x, Physics of
COVID-19 Transmission.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.990
The course is organized
into five chapters. First,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.000
transfer of
respiratory pathogens,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.440
where we will learn about how
viral and bacterial diseases

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.460
are transmitted through the air
through aerosol and other types

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.560
of droplets.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.540
In the next chapter,
part two, we

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.460
will study airborne transmission
in a well-mixed room.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.570
We'll analyze the
fluid mechanics

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.330
of droplet transfer between
individuals breathing

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.340
the same air in a room.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.660
And then in the next chapter,
we will describe basic models

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.330
in the field of epidemiology
to describe the spread

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.760
and transfer of disease.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.350
In the next chapter, 4, we will
integrate the disease modeling

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.430
with airborne transmission to
arrive at a safety guideline

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.180
to limit the indoor airborne
transmission of COVID-19.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.080
And we will apply it to
COVID-19 through analysis

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.200
of various spreading events.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.289
And then finally,
in Chapter 5, we

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:19.710
will go beyond the
well-mixed room

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.640
to discuss the fluid
mechanics of ventilation

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.600
and thermal flows
and respiratory flows

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.570
and understand the
limitations and extensions

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.940
of the analysis leading
to the safety guideline.
