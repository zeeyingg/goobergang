00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.580
PROFESSOR: So in the majority
of cases of indoor spreading

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.540
that occur over the space
of hours or even a few days,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.750
the Wells-Riley model
of slow incubation

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.000
where the number of
infectors is held constant

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.690
at the initial value, is a
reasonable approximation.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.560
For COVID-19, the
incubation period

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.440
is estimated to be on the
order of several days.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.010
For example, a
number of 5.5 days

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.400
is often quoted as an estimated
mean incubation period.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.190
On the other hand,
in some cases there

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.980
are spreading events that
involve people interacting over

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.190
much longer periods
of time than that.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.680
A famous example, which
is a little bit longer

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.470
than the time of
incubation, is the case

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.740
of the Diamond Princess
cruise ship, which

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.340
was quarantined in Yokohama
Port, Japan in early 2020

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.300
when it was detected that there
were a number of cases onboard.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.050
The exact number wasn't
known because they

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.590
hadn't tested the
entire population,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.800
but there were several cases.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.180
And so they decided
to quarantine

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.950
the ship for 12 days.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.280
And if you look at the number
of infections versus time

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.050
once they started
testing and felt

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.440
they had a good
sense of the numbers,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.400
you can see that
it rose from value,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.850
which we may estimate to be on
the order of 20 possible cases

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.050
initially.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.479
And it rises, but in a
very non-linear fashion.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.070
In fact, it starts to accelerate
and go steeper and steeper.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.860
Now recall, the Wells-Riley
model cannot possibly predict

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.729
this behavior because if you
have a fixed number infectors,

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.120
then at first you have a certain
rate of transmission but it

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.600
always has to slow down because
if there's no new infections,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.240
the same factors are running
out of susceptible people

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.750
to infect.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.610
The number of susceptible
is going down,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.230
and so you kind
of slowly saturate

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.080
until eventually you've
infected everybody,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.460
when it's just one person or
a fixed number of people who

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.720
are basically transmitting at
a constant rate of infection

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.510
quanta to everybody else.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.720
But that's not what happened.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.240
In fact, it's a very steep rise.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.740
It went-- just in
the last few days,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.790
it jumped by several
hundred people.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.250
And in fact, if
they hadn't stopped

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.780
the quarantine in 12 days--

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.210
there were 4,000
people on that ship.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.760
I think 3,711.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.240
I'll just mention I think
that was the number.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.060
So way higher.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.610
And you see how this
is accelerating.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.860
If they'd gone with the
quarantine a couple more days,

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.480
they might have had
thousands of people infected.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.230
So in fact, this is
an interesting warning

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.960
for quarantines,
that just cooping up

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.690
some people for 14 days
doesn't make everybody safe.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.240
If many of those people are
susceptible and are not yet

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.550
infected, they can
become infected.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.820
And many interesting
things about this incident

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.430
is that the people were not
in direct contact, obviously.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.470
Thousands of people were not
six feet apart from each other.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.990
They were often in
different rooms,

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.490
different floors of the ship.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.230
And yet, very large
numbers became

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.010
infected in a short time.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.940
So the important thing I'd like
to emphasize now coming back

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.650
to our SEI model is that this
sort of non-linear increase

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.329
can only be explained if you
have some accelerated spreading

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.220
due to new infected people.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.780
And it makes sense
after about five days.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.880
And we also don't know
when people got infected.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.880
So those initially infected
people may have been

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.170
infected five days earlier.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.600
So there may have been already
an increase in the number

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.310
infected people already at time
equals zero of the quarantine.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.050
And so we should now account
also for the exposed people.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.600
Those are people that may
not be showing symptoms yet,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.540
but have been exposed enough
that they can then pass it on.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.450
And so the rate of an
exposed person becoming

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.090
an infectious person is alpha.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.700
And inverse of alpha
is that 5.5 days.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.550
So that's the incubation time.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.700
And this might be something
like 5.5 days for COVID-19.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.460
But of course it can vary.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.300
But it's roughly in that order.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.070
And so it makes sense to
look at the Diamond Princess

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.190
and consider what would be
the effect of accounting

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.860
for incubation.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.480
So these are
non-linear equations

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.140
that don't have a simple
solution to the full model.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.630
But in the same way
the Wells-Riley model

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.130
is the limit of slow incubation,
where basically E stays zero

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.690
and basically you only
have infected people.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.650
Now, we can consider
the opposite limit

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.850
of fast incubation.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.620
So let's consider the opposite
limit of fast incubation.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.400
And this would be alpha
t much greater than one.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.840
So basically, we
want to make sure

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.920
that the t is much bigger
than the incubation time.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.340
And as I said, the
incubation time

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.020
doesn't necessarily
start at time zero.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.970
The infected people in
this case may have already

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.140
been infected five days earlier.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.520
In fact, the cruise
ship had been going

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.900
for actually weeks before that.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.410
So no one knows exactly
when the infection began.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.270
So it may be even likely
that that was happening.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.090
So let's consider the
fast incubation limit.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.120
So what this then tells us is
that now the exposed portion

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.960
is roughly zero.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.450
So if alpha is very quick,
then you pretty much quickly

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.040
go through the
exposed, and you end up

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.690
immediately being infected.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.300
And so this is actually
a much simpler model

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.030
where the number of
susceptibles is just n minus I.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.580
So there's no exposed
compartment anymore.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.290
So the Wells-Riley
model in some sense

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.000
is the SE model, where there
are only exposed people

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.110
and susceptible, but the
number infected doesn't change.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.710
This is really the
SI model, where

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.520
we don't worry about the
exposed compartment, OK?

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.290
So the equation we
want to solve then,

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.280
if we realize that
S is n minus I

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:05.820
is that dS dt is
minus beta of t SI.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.870
So that's the same equation
I wrote down earlier.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:08.940
But now let's substitute.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.780
Let's derive an equation
for the number of infected.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:27.110
So that will be from here, dI
dt will be beta of t times I.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.260
And then S is n minus
I. Because again,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.570
if we go straight through
the exposed fraction,

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.470
then basically this rate
of losing susceptibles

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.909
is equal to the rate of
creating new infected people.

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:44.110
Again, because n is fixed.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.360
The number of people is fixed.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.430
So dS dt is minus the dI dt.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.370
So this is the equation
now that we can solve

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.620
for this limit of the model.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.110
And fortunately, this is a
simple equation to solve.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.440
It's a first order separable
differential equation.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.630
So we can write
this as dI over I

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:13.670
times n minus I is
equal to beta of t dt.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.790
On this side, I
can write this as--

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:23.000
I can factor out a one over n,
and write this as one over I

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
plus one over n minus I. So
when I combine these two,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.950
I get In minus nine
in the denominator.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.650
And the numerator, I get n
minus I plus I. So just get n.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.650
But then it divides by
that n, so I do come back

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.480
to what I started with.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.200
And this times dI.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.540
And so now I can integrate
both sides this equation.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.520
Take into account
the initial condition

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.720
is that at t equals zero, the
number of infectors is I0.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.960
So basically, I can integrate
by going from zero to time, t.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.800
And on this side, in
terms of the infectors,

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:01.300
I'm going from I0 to the
current number of infectors, I.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.300
OK, so now we're ready to
integrate this equation.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.520
So let's multiply the
n to the other side

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.460
and do the integrals.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.780
So basically, the integral
of one over I is log I.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:17.790
So we have log I minus
log of n minus I.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.180
And that's because
there's a minus I there,

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.530
so that leads to a
minus sign out front.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.290
On the other side, if I
multiply through by n,

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:29.280
I have n integral
from zero to t of beta

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.770
of t dt plus a constant
of integration.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.780
The boundary condition that I
need is that I of zero is I0.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.330
So a t equals zero,
this term vanishes,

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.740
and this expression must be
evaluated with I equal to I0.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.800
So therefore, there
must be on this side

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.290
of the equation,
some constants log

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:55.260
of I0 minus log of n minus I0.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.440
So now we satisfy the boundary
condition or initial condition

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.600
of t equals zero.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:05.370
Now, I can also write this in
terms of the quanta emission

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.210
rate for the initial infectors,
which we defined earlier.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:14.280
So for the Wells-Riley model,
we talked about writing q of t

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.530
is the number of quanta emitted
by the initial infector.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.750
So if we just define it as
I zero times the integral

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.890
over time of beta
of t dt, this is

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:33.590
the sort of infection
quanta emitted

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.980
by the I0 initial infectors.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:43.190
So if we take that here,
we can express the solution

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:44.240
a somewhat different way.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.120
If I take an exponential
on both sides,

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.060
the difference of two logs
is the log of the ratio.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.310
And when I exponentiate,
I get rid of the log.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:58.700
So this side turns into I over
n minus I. And the other side,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:04.760
we have from the similar
expression, I0 over n minus I0.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.750
But times, now, the
exponential of--

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:15.260
well, if we want to express it
in terms of q0, it would be n.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:23.230
And then this d beta dt
has a one over I0 q of t.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.720
So this is the
solution in this case.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.260
Now, if we look at early times--

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:42.200
and so then that would be
less than incubation time.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:47.110
So if basically our alpha
t is much less than one--

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.210
so not much incubation
is occurred.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.810
And basically during that time
I is approximately still equal

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:53.470
to I0.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.840
So that would be kind of in
the early, early stages here

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.070
of this dynamics--

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:07.770
then we could write that
I of t is, well, from this

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:12.480
we could write it as n minus I0.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:21.130
And then I0 times the time
interval of beta, or n minus I0

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:26.090
times q, or it's the number
of susceptibles times q of t.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:31.400
So this is a result
that can come directly

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.080
from analyzing this expression.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:39.860
We can also see it here,
that if I is not changing,

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:46.130
then we have I, n minus
I. And we can also

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:47.720
see this expression
here where we just

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.730
integrate both sides in time
to get to this equation here.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.480
So it's basically the
same as the Wells-Riley

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.380
in an early time.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.480
And that's an
interesting observation,

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:03.880
which is that there
is a universal sort

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:09.600
of small transmission limit
in both limits of this model.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:18.180
And what that is,
if we take this--

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.180
at least for the
SEI model, if we

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:25.740
write how many exposed
plus infected relative

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.710
to the initial number
of infectors, OK?

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:33.240
So that is telling us how
many transmissions there

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.890
are, either to make
someone exposed

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.130
or to make them infectious
from the initial number

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.960
of infectors.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.830
That at early times,
we get this same result

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.920
that we had before
because we got

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.880
the same thing for the
Wells-Riley model for E,

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.180
here it's for I. And
we find that this

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.860
is this what we call Rn, the
indoor transmission number.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.030
Which is the initial number of
susceptibles times the number

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.180
of quanta transferred.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:08.700
And in the case where if S0 were
equal to n minus one, and I0

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:13.290
were equal to one, this
would be n minus one integral

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.960
over t of beta dt.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.560
That would be that case
that we talked about before

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.630
for the indoor
transmission number.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.370
But more generally, it
would look like this.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.210
So that is at early times,
before many transmissions

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:28.200
have happened.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.130
It really doesn't matter
what's the details

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.890
of the model in terms of
the non-linear response.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.860
So even if after a
longer amount of time

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.930
more and more
people get infected,

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.840
the initial moments are always
universal and are really

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.770
just governed by this
transmission rate

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:44.100
beta and the number of
susceptible people and number

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.210
of infectious people
initially in the room.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.450
So it's kind of independent
of all these details here.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.370
And so then to kind of
summarize that picture,

00:13:53.370 --> 00:14:03.580
we could plot versus time here
what happens in terms of the--

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.650
so we have a rate
of transmission

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:10.130
where if I look at
the total number of

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.340
exposed plus
infected people, OK.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.040
And then here's the total
number of people in the room, n.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:24.360
So in the Wells-Riley
model, everyone's exposed,

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.490
but nobody becomes infectious.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:30.900
And we know that we get this
kind of exponential relaxation

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.480
as we eventually run out
of susceptible people.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:39.560
And the timescale for
that is beta inverse, OK.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.610
And that gives you
the transmission time

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:43.920
for just a fixed
number of infectors

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.110
to slowly infect everybody else.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.500
But in the case like
we described here

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.690
where we have some
non-linear acceleration,

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:52.980
that has to start out the same.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.440
That's what I'm
trying to say here,

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.550
is the initial transmission
rate doesn't matter

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.250
if there is an incubation rate
until you reach the incubation

00:14:59.250 --> 00:14:59.860
time.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.320
So there's kind of
an alpha inverse

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.770
here, which is the
incubation time.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.400
This one here is the
transmission time.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.680
And at this time
scale, you start

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:21.010
to see an exponential increase
until it saturates basically

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.430
once all the transmission has
occurred because now there's

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.520
more and more infectious people.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:33.850
And so this is the fast
incubation and slow incubation.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:43.990
And this one is the Wells-Riley
model, which is widely used.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.750
But if you're fitting spreading
data where there may actually

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.470
be some incubation going on,
and also potentially removal--

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.240
we could add another equation
for the removal of people.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.290
We need to be careful on
how we fit data in order

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:57.670
to extract information about
the transmission rate, which

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.290
is what we're
interested in what we're

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.300
trying to interpret the data.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:06.310
So maybe an important
conclusion from this

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:11.870
is that infection
quanta, this notion--

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.860
or the infection quantum, I
guess you can say, one of them.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.680
Which is a quantity that
was introduced by Wells,

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.830
really based on this
Wells-Riley model,

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.000
is basically-- think of
this exponential relaxation,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.250
and saying when let's say 63%
of people become infected,

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.650
that's what you say is
one infection quantum

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:33.910
has been transmitted to
each of those people.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.300
Then really, it's
better defined--

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.930
I'll just write here it's
defined by the transmission

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:47.180
rate and not by the
number of people

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.310
that actually get infected.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.730
So if you look at some
data like the Diamond

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.420
Princess or other data that
we're going to look at later,

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.650
you are seeing
spreading happening

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.330
and there could be
lots of contributions

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:57.950
to the number of people
that actually get sick.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.270
For example, there could
be incubation going on.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.630
So what's sometimes called
the secondary attack

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:09.470
rate is E plus I divided by S0.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.770
So the secondary
attack rate is sort

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.190
of the fraction
of people that are

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.170
susceptible that got infected.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.500
And the Wells-Riley would
say, when that 63% then you've

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.530
transmitted a quantum
to each of those people.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.599
Whereas, as we see in the case
of the fast incubation model,

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:26.480
that's not how you would
interpret that data.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.490
But on the other hand,
beta is well-defined.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.980
It's just each person
is transferring quanta

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.690
at a certain rate
and has the potential

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.280
to infect other people.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.040
Now, I don't want to
overstate the relevance

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.680
of this model for a particular
case like the Diamond Princess

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.220
cruise ship.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.940
We'll come back to this later.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.490
But just simply to
illustrate that it

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.470
has this kind of
non-linear feature

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.570
which is suggestive
of incubation

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:50.810
occurring and an increase in
the number of infected people.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:54.620
And just to point out that
this sort of simple modeling

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.990
leads us to kind of a
universal expression

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.860
for the initial transmission
from the initial in factors

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:04.190
for each of them to transfer
to sort of one other,

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:07.700
which is this indoor
reproductive number.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.580
And that's really what's
valid at the early times here.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.620
And that's where we have
kind of a universal behavior.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.290
And that's useful in
formulating safety guidelines,

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:20.380
which we will do next.
