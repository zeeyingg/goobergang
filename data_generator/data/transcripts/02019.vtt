WEBVTT

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.730
PROFESSOR: So let's build
on this concept of diffusion

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.060
of virions in
droplets to understand

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.890
how we would expect a
size dependent infectivity

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.920
of virions in different
sized droplets.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.350
So an important
concept in epidemiology

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.890
that we will come to
later is the infectivity,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.540
which is the probability
that if a virion is transferred

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.550
that it actually causes
an infection in the host.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.490
That can be further
broken down into a product

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.390
of two probabilities.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.810
The first is that if the virus
has escaped from the droplet,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.000
it actually causes an infection.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.300
And that's perhaps something
which is roughly constant.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.380
It has to do with the
physiology of the host.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.490
But then there is the escape
of the virion from the droplet.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.080
And as we've already
discussed, that's

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.970
a strongly size
dependent quantity.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.680
And from very large
droplets, it's

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.290
very difficult in a mucus
droplet, especially,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.280
for the virion to diffuse out
in a reasonable amount of time.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.970
And in fact, virions
are typically

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.710
found to have a
period of deactivation

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.260
where after a certain
amount of time,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.240
they are no longer viable
and able to basically cause

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.420
further infection.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.870
And so if we assume
there's a certain time

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.870
t, or tau v for the
virus deactivation,

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.730
then we can ask
ourselves if the virus

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.060
has had a chance to escape
or not as a function of size.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.400
So basically, to
solve this problem,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.500
we think of the droplet here.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.789
And we actually want to
solve a diffusion problem

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.080
where C here is the
concentration of viruses

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.560
in the domain.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.950
D is the diffusivity
of the viruses.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.670
And this is the
[INAUDIBLE] equation

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.800
in the sphere, which is
the diffusion equation.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.600
And our boundary
conditions are that C of R

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.210
and 0, the initial
condition is 0.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.130
And then at R and t,
it's going to be one.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.670
So basically what
we're imagining here

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.230
is that we're
trying to figure out

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.329
the C will be the
concentration viruses that

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:18.940
has left the system actually.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.380
So what we have is if we look
as a function of the radius,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.570
of the radius of this
thing is R, capital R. So

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.600
in that distance, we
have this constant--

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.670
what I'm calling
concentration here is just

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.550
going to jump up to one.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.810
And then it's going to
diffuse inward like this.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.290
OK, and then eventually
the final state

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.460
is that it's entirely
basically one everywhere.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.920
And that's when basically
the probability of removal

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.270
has hit every part of the
drop and all of the virus

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.980
has been removed.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.450
So the C is a time
dependent fraction

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.580
of the virus, the virions
in the droplet, which

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.430
had been removed at time t.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.470
So this spherical
diffusion equation

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.170
can be solved analytically
in various ways.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.270
But there's not a simple closed
form solution to this problem.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.940
And what we're really
interested in here

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.130
is just a rough
approximation of what

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.270
the solution might look like.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.960
So let's pull out an
approximation for this.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.430
So I'll sketch the
droplet again here.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.760
Now at early times,
when there hasn't

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.100
been a chance for the
viruses, the virions

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.630
to diffuse very far.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.640
Then only those which
are close to the boundary

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.780
actually have a
chance of leaving.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.400
That's this initial boundary
earlier that I sketched here,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.280
which is working its way in.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.079
So why don't we
sketch the central region

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.130
and give that a distance delta,
which is the boundary layer

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.740
thickness.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.980
So basically this outer
annulus has been--

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.760
is really where virions
had a chance to leave.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.870
And that's where c
is jumping to one.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.620
And from-- if this
were just a plane

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.460
with a semi-infinite diffusion
towards the center, so

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.160
in other words, this
delta is much less than R,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.010
capital R, the radius, then
it's almost like diffusion

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.120
from a planar source.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.190
And then we actually know
that this distance as well

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.730
approximated by
square root of 2 DT.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.490
So that just comes from solving
the diffusion equation in one

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.250
dimension leads to that
scaling of the diffusion layer

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.760
thickness.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.190
So that's this thickness
of this blue region

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.400
as it goes that way is delta.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.340
And it scales as
it's approximated

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.360
by square root of 2DT.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.180
And now let's ask
ourselves then what

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.480
is this concentration here?

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.870
Well, what I'm really
interested in actually

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.440
is this escape probability PE.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.600
And that's going
to be the integral

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.670
of CDV over the volume.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.600
So this is the integral
over all the R's that

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.310
are less than capital
R. So basically

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.320
inside the drop of this
concentration field.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.390
So that contrary field starts
at 0 and eventually goes to 1.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.800
And that base is giving me
this total escape probability.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.160
So to calculate this integral
of the concertation field,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.170
I basically have a
domain at the outside

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.420
here with the concept of
this concentration variable

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.180
is near one and a
central region where

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.820
it's C approximately zero.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.370
And here C is equal to
one on the boundary.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.600
This variable I've defined here.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.920
So therefore, I can write that
this PE is, roughly speaking,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.680
if we think of just
what is the volume

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.030
of that spherical
annulus, that would be--

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.130
and relative to
the total volume--

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.820
that would be r-cube minus
R minus delta cube divided

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.570
by r-cube.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.320
So each of the volumes has a
4/3 pi, which I've canceled off.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.450
So this is basically the
volume of the total sphere

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.200
minus the volume in
the inner sphere.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.970
So that's just the
volume of the shell.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.070
Then I normalize
it properly here.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:16.690
So this is one minus delta
over r parentheses cubed.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.290
And if I now--

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.840
and I have this expression here.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.810
So now I have at
least an approximation

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.690
for what this might look like.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.080
We can also further say
that this approximation here

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.800
was valid for the delta
B much less than r.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.950
And when that's the
case, then I also

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.600
can say that this
quantity is small.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.640
So at early times that's small.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.870
And I can expand.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.760
All right, this is 1 minus.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.590
And then 1 minus
something cubed,

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.920
where that something is
small, is 1 minus 3 times

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.100
that something.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.060
That's basically a
tailor expansion.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.020
So that when I work this
out, the ones cancel.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:01.490
And I get three delta
over R. So what we find

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:08.300
is that this PE, which
we're trying to calculate,

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.080
has two limits that
are easy to calculate.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.380
One of them is this 3 delta
over R. And if that's our delta,

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.940
then we get 3 square
root of 2 DT times R.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.060
And specifically, the p is
defined up to a certain time

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.840
tau v. So I'll now
replace t with tau v

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.190
because that is my timescale
for virus deactivation.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:38.730
And so this would be in the
case where this quantity is--

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.030
basically, this ratio here
is much less than one.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.480
And then in the
opposite limit where

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.870
this diffusion has completely
spanned the particle

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.290
and is getting
much bigger than R,

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.120
then this obviously
has to tend to 1.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:57.300
OK, now, I can write
down a function

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.090
that makes this transition
right about when

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.820
this thing is of order
one in a variety of ways.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.310
One way we could
do that would be

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.050
to write that PE
is approximately

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.850
given by 1 minus the exponential
of minus this quantity.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:21.220
So minus 3 square root of
2 d tau v divided by R.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:26.150
And you can see there we
have a-- there's sort of--

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.630
you could either write
this in terms of a time

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.840
where the critical time is--

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.640
so we could write this--

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.169
just to get more
insight into it,

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:40.190
we could write PE is
approximately 1 minus e

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:46.340
to the minus tau v
over some timescale--

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.650
I'll call it tau
d for diffusion--

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:57.170
where we see here that
tau d is R squared over--

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.950
and then it's--

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.430
To bring inside the square
root, this 3 becomes 9.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:02.660
And then times 2 is 18.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.240
So 18D.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.280
Now, you may recall from
our last calculation,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.310
the average first passage
time in the sphere calculated

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.910
exactly was R squared over 15D.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.100
So this very simple
calculation is clearly

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.110
giving us roughly the
right order of magnitude

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.430
for that time.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.140
But we're actually
not interested so much

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.510
in writing this
in terms of time.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.630
We'd actually like to
write in terms of radius.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:30.500
So I can also write PE is
1 minus E to the minus R.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.250
I'll call it maybe Rd
for diffusion over R

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:43.970
where Rd is basically all this
stuff, 3 root 2 d tau v. OK,

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.590
so this is maybe another
useful way to write that.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:51.200
And what does this function
look like as a function of R,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.040
this one right here?

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.090
So maybe if I sketch
that out, I'll

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.390
look at this a little
bit more carefully.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.920
Let's plot this.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:07.660
So as a function of R, here is
this Rd, this critical size.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.850
When we are smaller than that
critical size, then basically

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.650
we have that PE.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.840
The escape probability,
essentially,

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.940
is very close to 1, OK,
because then we have--

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.940
that's basically just
what we were just arguing.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.200
It's this limit right here.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.620
But then it's a
function that when

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.990
it gets much larger
than our d, then it

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.780
decays as we suggested
here as sort of 1 over R.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:37.060
So it's actually a fairly
slow decay in the long run.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.300
So basically, there's
this limit here.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.790
And I just wanted to
get to this picture.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.160
Just to point out that even
though there are obviously

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.630
physiological characteristics
having to do with the way

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.090
the a virion would actually
get into a host cell

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.910
and whether they
would get infected,

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.380
but a lot of those
properties should

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.160
be independent of the delivery
of the virion in a droplet.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.880
It's really more once the virion
gets out, there's some process.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.860
But what this
calculation shows is

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.070
that we would expect a
fairly strong dependence

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.200
of the infectivity on
the size of the drop.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.070
Well, in particular, if
we calculate this Rd.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.280
We'll have some
idea that droplets

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.410
that are smaller
than that are highly

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.440
infectious because every
virion in those droplets

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.290
can get out and
infect the host cell.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.500
Whereas if the virus is--

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.100
the droplet is much
bigger than that,

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.220
then you have this problem where
this dead region in the middle.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.990
And those virions
are not going to be

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.550
able to get out in a
reasonable amount of time,

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.340
which is set by this tau v.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:41.160
So for example, a tau v for
SARS COV-2, the coronavirus,

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.100
is estimated to be
anywhere from one hour.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.350
There was one study
in aerosol droplets

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.850
finding that kind of decay.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.130
But another study found
that after 16 hours,

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.030
it was still viable.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.680
So there's not quite a
consensus forming yet.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.780
But it may be a time on the
order of hours, certainly

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:02.250
days, over which the virion
needs to get out of the droplet

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.550
in order to be able
to cause infection.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.690
And this calculation shows
you that as a result,

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:12.180
you would expect a size
dependent diffusivity--

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.220
or excuse me, a size
dependent infectivity.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.860
And roughly speaking, if
we plug-in the numbers,

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.830
these are the aerosol droplets.

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.900
And these are the large drops.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:23.900
We've already done that.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:27.140
That was our previous
calculation based on this time

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.540
here, which is what
I'm calling tau

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.310
d here, which
corresponds to this,

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:34.400
is also pretty close
to what we call tau 0.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.720
That was the-- well, that
was the longest escape time,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.720
actually what I call, I
think, tau bar actually,

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.520
which was R squared over 15d.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.240
That was the
average escape time.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.660
So basically, we've already
shown that that average escape

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:54.350
time starts to become
days or even months when

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:55.320
we get to large drops.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.500
But for the aerosol
droplets in mucus

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.960
anyway, this timescale
is of order minutes

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.370
to hours, which is reasonable.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.690
And you would expect those to
be very infectious droplets.
