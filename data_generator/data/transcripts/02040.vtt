00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.010
PROFESSOR: So now, we can
summarize the safety guideline

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.230
in a very simple formula, using
the steady state transmission

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.390
rate as a more
conservative estimate

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.810
than worrying about the
transient buildup of aerosols

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.500
in the room, and using the
simplification of introducing

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.010
an effective size
for particles, R bar,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.530
that includes and encodes
all the information

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.640
about the radius dependent
mass penetration factor

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.190
or sedimentation rate and
infectivity, et cetera,

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.110
in droplet size distribution.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.250
And the safety guideline
looks like this.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.340
It basically bounds the
cumulative exposure time,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.610
which is n minus 1, the
number of susceptible people

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.400
when one person enters a room of
occupancy n, maximum occupancy,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.830
and stays for a time tau.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.320
And I should mention
the time tau does not

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.560
need to be continuous.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.130
So if you think of, say,
a classroom or an office,

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.870
you will be adding up
the time, total time.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.530
So if this safe
time is 100 hours

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.310
and you spend 10
hours a day, you

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.670
might get 10 days, according
to this calculation.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.289
And so that relationship is
plotted as this yellow curve.

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.130
And if you're below
that curve, you're safe.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.090
So you have either smaller time
than that or a lower occupancy.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.920
And that's how you
can decide the safety.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.440
Again, this is a safety
exposure guideline

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.150
for indoor airborne
transmission.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.560
And we will talk about other
types of transmission later.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.150
What's nice about
this formula is

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.130
it allows you to
immediately see the effects

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.920
of the scaling, some
of which we've already

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.350
talked about before.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.800
So if we would like to
move it in this direction,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.470
obviously, we would like the
curve to be up here somewhere.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.740
So this is obviously
making the room more safe.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.210
If I can push it
in this direction,

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.700
I can either get more
people or more time

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.500
or whatever combination
that I'd like.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.780
How can I get there?

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.040
So Cq is a disease
specific parameter.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.130
But we will see
that Cq does depend

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.930
on the type of respiration
and activities,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.300
such as singing
or heavy exercise

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.440
or loud speaking are much worse
than resting or breathing.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.150
So to get in this
direction, we could

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:35.640
do smaller Cq, which
could be resting

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.050
versus speaking or singing.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.920
And we'll come back
to characterizing that

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.610
more carefully.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.800
So we can at least change that
type of activity in the room.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.790
Well for physical
parameters, we can

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.170
increase V, the room volume.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.590
So if you take everything the
same, same number of people,

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.180
and you make the
room much bigger,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.250
obviously the air
gets more diluted.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.560
And hence, there's less
chance of transmission

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.700
if people are sort of
scattered about the room.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.170
What else can we do?

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:18.940
We can lower Qb, which means
breathe slowly or in a more

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.060
relaxed way.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.610
So again, coming
back to the activity

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.650
in the room, if you have
heavy physical exercise,

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.160
your Qb might increase, although
it doesn't increase that much.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.060
Resting breathing is around
0.5 meters cube per hour.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.150
And even heavy exercise
doesn't get much higher

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.450
than about 3 meters
cubed per hour.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.090
And so that's a total
of a factor of 6 or so.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.350
But it comes in squared.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.120
So that could actually
be significant.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.900
So definitely heavy exercise
is not as good as resting.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.950
And what else do we have?

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:51.530
We have masks.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.970
Well, obviously,
we can wear masks.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.170
And that is actually
very helpful,

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.510
because as we've already
discussed, it comes in squared.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.080
And that is something which
is sort of very simple fix.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.630
And if the mask
penetration factor

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.530
is 10% or even possibly
less, it comes in squared.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.400
So that can have a very big
effect of pushing this over,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.730
as we will see.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:23.680
So this is basically
lower P mask.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.200
So when there's no
mask, Pm is equal to 1.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.210
Finally we also
have an lambda C,

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.880
because we had written
that out earlier,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.730
that also includes
several effects,

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.500
such as better ventilation.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.920
So increase ventilation, so
the flow rate of outside air,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.870
so the air change rate
should be increased.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.750
And that gives us
a larger lambda C.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.120
We can introduce air filtration.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.310
And that's sort of
buried within lambda C.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.230
That's PF lambda F. Although
as we discussed earlier,

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.480
because you have to have a
certain amount of fresh air

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.910
coming into the room, air
filtration doesn't give you

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.770
as much benefit
as you might hope,

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.160
but can still give you a
factor of 5 or something

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.290
like that if you have 20%
outdoor fresh air coming in.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.300
And so those are some
of the key scalings

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.070
that we can understand.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.380
And just simply by plugging
into a formula like this,

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.650
we can get a sense of how
different mitigation strategies

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.230
can be compared and also
how different types of rooms

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.870
can be compared in terms
of the occupancy time

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.760
and the number of
people that could be

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.620
allowed as a maximum occupancy.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.350
And what remains now is the
parameterize this for COVID-19

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.560
specifically, which boils down
to understanding this parameter

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.110
Cq.
