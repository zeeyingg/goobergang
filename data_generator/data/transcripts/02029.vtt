WEBVTT

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.950
PROFESSOR: So now we've
included all the key physics

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.900
in our model--

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.640
sedimentation, deactivation of
virus, filtration of the air,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.340
ventilation flows.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.940
And now, we have to include
one last piece of information,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.610
which is that all
of those quantities,

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.270
or many of them that
we've discussed,

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.820
have a dependence on the
size of the droplets.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.130
And the size of the droplets
and number of the droplets

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.620
is a strong function of
the type of respiration

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.690
which is being performed
by the infected person who

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.130
is spewing out or
emitting these droplets,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.040
and also the respiration of
the susceptible person who's

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.650
breathing those droplets in.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.150
So here is a sketch of what
droplet distributions look

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.910
like that have been
measured for different kinds

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.950
of expiratory activities.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.420
So this is shown kind
of on a log scale,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.370
at least what I'm
attempting to sketch.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.430
So the dotted line
here, roughly speaking,

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.470
is separating the
aerosol droplets,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.710
which are less than
several microns in radius

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.530
and the large droplets,
which are bigger than that.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.240
And what you can see here
is that as you change

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.580
from resting breathing,
which is let's

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.460
say through the nose or
even resting breathing

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.010
through the mouth, this
distribution starts to go up.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.440
When you start speaking,
there's a significant increase

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.789
in the emissions.

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.450
Presumably because there is
a fragmentation and breakup

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.970
of mucus which is surrounding
the vocal cords in the pharynx.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.160
Which leads to significant
aerosol emissions, which do not

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.200
evaporate and do not
follow the Wells curve,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.940
but actually survive.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.950
And then that becomes
much more extreme

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.330
as we get towards singing and
any prolonged vocalizations.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.610
In fact, also, this
size here depends

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.509
on the volume of speaking.

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.790
So this is loud speaking,
and somewhere below here

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.570
is whispering.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.370
So basically, the
amount that you release

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.690
is a strong function of
the volume of speech.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.790
And whether you're
vocalizing or not

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.460
makes a big difference, where
vocalization leads to many more

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.250
droplets being formed
that are aerosols

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.150
that remain in the air.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.660
And singing is actually probably
almost as bad as you can get,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.100
in terms of spewing
out droplets.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.400
What's interesting is that
all these distributions have

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.740
a peak or the most
probable value

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.360
is actually less than a micron.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.480
So it's around
maybe half a micron

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.750
in diameter, which is even
a quarter micron in radius.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.420
But it can vary.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.500
So it's somewhere
in the range of,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.680
let's just say 0.3 to
one micron is somewhere

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.900
where you'll find the peak
of these distributions.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.650
And then they drop off, but in
such a way that they're not--

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.960
they're dropping off
fairly quickly in number,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.860
but since the larger droplets
carry more volume, like R

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.220
cubed, it turns out they're
not decaying quite so quickly

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.020
as a function of volume.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.790
But still, they are
decaying and the peak

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.550
is in the aerosol range.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.930
So clearly, there is a strong
size dependence there which

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.320
you must take into account.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.400
But that's not it.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.730
We've already talked about
other quantities which

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.350
also strong size dependence.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.690
So we've talked
about infectivity.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.370
If we think about
a water droplet,

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.250
I was calculating the
time for the virion

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.710
to get out of the water
droplet by diffusion.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.910
And we saw that even up to 10
micron-type sizes, the virion

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.350
can still escape.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.300
On the other hand,
if it's in mucus,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.560
as the droplets that are emitted
from-- especially vocalization

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.110
patterns-- then you'll
find that, as we've already

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.170
calculated, that cutoff
where you start to not

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.790
have time for the
virus to get out

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.750
might be on the
order of microns.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.210
And so we're
certainly going to see

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.680
that the aerosols
are infectious,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.750
and that has been
shown experimentally.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.350
But we may not find that they're
as infectious in the larger

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.130
drop form.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.510
So that's something
we could also

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.350
take into account in the model.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.190
And then of course
masks and air filters

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.380
have a strong
dependence on size,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.510
and that's included
in their ratings.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.480
So for example, when
we go from an N95 mask

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.820
to various forms of
cloth face covering,

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.420
there's a lot of experimental
data showing the transmission

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.709
of those different droplet sizes
through different materials.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.960
And in addition to the material,
there's also the fit factor.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.700
So you can have a
really great material.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.790
If you measure it, it's 99%
removing the aerosol droplets.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.450
But then you put on
your face and you've

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.200
got a big gap over
your nose or you let

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.050
it sink down below your nose.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.190
And suddenly, you're
letting a lot out as well.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.430
So the fit of the mask
is also very important,

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.710
and somehow ends up being
included in this quantity.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.620
But clearly, there's a
strong size dependence.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.630
Although, I would point
out, both these quantities

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.300
are not varying too much
over the aerosol range.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.250
So if we're focusing
on aerosols,

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.100
then the variation isn't as much
as you might think, actually.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.290
So what happens
with the filters is

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.030
when you get to bigger
than 10 microns,

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.890
like 10 millimeter
scale, then there's

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.930
a physical blocking
of those droplets

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.580
and they get condensed
and collected

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.160
on the fibers of the material.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.770
And so there's almost
100% of filtration

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.390
at the scale of millimeters.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.750
So when you have a
large cough or sneeze,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.780
if you are wearing a mask--
even a fairly poor mask-- a lot

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.620
of it gets filtered.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.740
Yes, some drops do get through
and that's been observed,

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.800
but it's very significantly
filtered at the high sizes.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.110
On the other hand, when you
get down to the aerosols,

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.760
then the masks may not
be filtering so strongly.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.260
And the same thing
with the filters.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.510
So the HEPA filter
is intended to remove

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.840
the aerosol droplets, even
those which are below a micron.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.659
But the various MERV
ratings of filters

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:45.450
are not really going after the
aerosols as much, but still

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.580
have a significant removal.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.220
Maybe in the order
of tens of a percent,

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.290
or maybe up to even 90%,
depending on the rating.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.960
So the point is, all these
quantities are size dependent.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.570
So we have to go back and
revisit our model including

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.660
that size dependence.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.290
OK, so it just makes things a
little bit more complicated,

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.680
but not too much.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.680
So let's go back yet
again to our mass balance,

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.600
but now we're going to do it
in a radius resolved fashion.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.050
And so for this, I'm
in need a C of R and t,

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.750
and I'm going to use the same
notation, C, even though I've

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.240
just changed the meaning
here by including the R.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.540
And this is going to be a
radius resolved concentration

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.230
of virions.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.790
So that means it's
a number of virions

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.659
per air volume per radius, OK?

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:49.750
And so, now when we write
the mass balance, instead of

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.850
a dC dt with an
order derivative,

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.310
it's actually a
partial derivative.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.830
Because C is now a
function of R and t.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.850
So I have a partial
dC dt, and then

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.970
if I divide through by
volume on the other side,

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.580
I have a P which
now depends on R.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.470
So the production
rate of droplets

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.810
is certainly very
strongly size-dependent,

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.970
and then all these other
factors may come in as well.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.310
Divided by volume.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.590
And then, we have a lambda
C, which now depends

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.830
on R times concentration.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.590
So this is now what happens
to our mass balance.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.100
And this lambda C of R--

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.640
what does that look like?

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:44.110
Well, it's lambda
a times one plus--

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.940
and then we have the
sedimentation effect.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:51.720
And I'm going to write
this as R over RC squared.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.670
Because we know the
sedimentation of velocity

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.350
scales like R squared.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.370
I'll come back to
this in just a moment.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.130
This is sedimentation.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.030
That's the tricky part.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.770
It is strongly size-dependent.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:10.470
Plus lambda v and plus Pf
lambda f, which of course,

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:14.240
depends on R as well.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.100
Lambda v in principle
could depend on R,

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.890
although we haven't
really considered that.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:23.410
We've been thinking of more just
spontaneous or maybe chemical

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.020
disinfectants.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.250
In the case of
chemical disinfectants,

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.650
maybe that's size-dependent too
because whether the virion is

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.020
attacked by a chemical depends
on how big the droplet is.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.510
So in principle, this could
also be size-dependent.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.309
So basically, everything
is size-dependent.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:38.570
Except for lambda a as the
airflow, air changed rate.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.630
And that, of course,
does not depend on size.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.169
Now, what have I
done here in this RC?

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:49.820
So I've written here that
if I write lambda s of R

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.280
is the sedimentation
rate, that's

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.990
vs of R divided by the height.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.700
So basically, that's
what we talked about

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:04.000
before as the rate at which
particles are sedimenting

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.990
onto the horizontal surfaces.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.400
Where, remember H is v over a.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.050
And then what I've
done here-- notice,

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.390
so what was supposed to
be here is lambda s of R,

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.940
but then I factored
out lambda a.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:21.220
So what this term is here is
lambdas s of R over lambda a.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.720
That is by definition--

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.090
so that's the same
as vs of R over va,

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.010
were va is the air velocity.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.970
So that's Q, the air flow
rate, the outdoor air flow

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.630
rate divided by a.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.350
And then we're writing
that as R over RC

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.900
squared because we know that
vs scales like R squared.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.060
So when I factor this out,
I can define a quantity RC.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.530
And what does that
RC turn out to be?

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.470
That is-- basically,
you can actually just

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.310
see by working it through
this form formula.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:03.510
Actually, I'll just leave it
here as a definition basically.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.420
Now, then we can
also now say what

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.080
happens to these kinds
of droplet distributions.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.710
So this is kind of
the important thing,

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:16.130
is that lambda C
is something which

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.920
has some R dependence from
filtration, as we're sketching

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.930
here, but it has
also very strong R

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.250
dependence from sedimentation.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.010
So we don't show it here, but
the sedimentation velocity kind

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.640
of increases like R squared.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.470
So that's a pretty
big dependence.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:29.930
And so what that
means is that if I

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.420
take some of these initial
droplet distributions

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.040
that are coming
from breathing-- so

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.800
imagine this is kind of
the drop of distribution

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.170
soon after the aerosols
leave the mouth,

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.690
after the initial
evaporation has taken place,

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.090
but the Wells curve has
been disrupted by the fact

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:49.200
that there's mucus with lots of
solute and charged molecules.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.550
And so the droplets have reached
an equilibrium distribution

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.510
that looks something
like is shown here.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.180
If I then ask myself what
happens at a later time,

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.660
how does that build up?

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.830
So let's say one person in
the room who is-- basically

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.930
one of these curves
is describing

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.540
the distribution of
droplets that they

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.700
are emitting from breathing.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.360
So let's ask ourselves what
happens to the concentration

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.230
profile in those cases.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:20.890
So there is an RC here
and R. And basically

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.300
as you can see, when
R is less than RC,

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.930
then the sedimentation
term is small.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.520
And essentially
it's just lambda a.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.600
So that means that the removal
of the infectious particles

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.710
is dominated by ventilation,
which is not size dependent.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.720
So when you're
less than RC, which

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.720
is another way of defining
the aerosol range,

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.010
that is where you don't have
a strong size dependence.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:49.000
But when you're in the large
drop category, of course

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.340
those drops are sedimenting.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.110
And in fact, this term
can be very large.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.620
If we go out to 10 microns
or even up to a millimeter,

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.540
the sedimentation rate
is incredibly fast.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.670
And those droplets are
very quickly removed

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.470
and do not end up
swirling around the room,

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.330
as we've been describing.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.170
So let's imagine we take-- let's
say it's somebody speaking.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.030
And let's say that, just
for illustration purposes,

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.880
let's say it initially
looks like this.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.630
So this is kind of the
initial profile that's

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.820
in the room in early times.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.920
Now at first, until we get to
a time inverse of lambda C,

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.760
that's the concentration
or relaxation time.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.010
Over that time scale,
the concentration

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.690
is going to be building.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.720
But it's building the
fastest in the aerosol range

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.310
because those guys
are not being removed.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.260
These guys, though,
are being removed.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.780
So instead of
increasing, it doesn't

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.420
increase that much because
they're also being removed.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:49.340
So what happens at a later
time is that this goes up,

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.070
but not so much over there.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.970
And it gets more and more
peaked in the aerosol range

00:12:55.970 --> 00:13:04.510
because here you have basically
fast removal of large drops.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:10.990
But here, you have slow
buildup of aerosols.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.350
So if you wait for a timescale--
the time it takes here,

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.290
time is basically
lambda C inverse.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.170
So we call that tC
or tau C, that's

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.120
the timescale for buildup.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.740
That's the inverse of this.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.500
That's how long it takes to
essentially reach steady state.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.930
And where you really get
the biggest increase is

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.460
among the aerosol,
because over here

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:35.750
you're basically losing them.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.670
Now, there are
filtration effects too,

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.050
and there's also
the infectivity.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.000
So there are other
competing size dependencies

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.120
that might actually emphasize
the large scale here,

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.300
so I want to make sure
we're clear about that.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.210
But these size
dependencies are bounded.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.520
For example, the mass
filtration is sort of

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.020
bounded by one, right?

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:53.110
But R squared just keeps going.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.950
So if you go to larger
and larger particles,

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.090
they sediment faster
and faster and faster.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:57.770
OK.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:58.880
And so it really is true--

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.650
I didn't draw this
very well, but if you

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.880
get to like large
sizes on the order of,

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.750
let's say millimeters,
those droplets really

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.370
never build up in
the air because they

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.830
sediment almost immediately.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.770
When you cough or sneeze,
the largest droplets fall

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.210
and it happens very quickly.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.970
It might happen in a
few seconds or a minute.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.650
And we're talking
about timescales here

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.270
that are on the order
of the air change

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.410
rate, which might be
on the order of hours

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:24.360
or tens of minutes.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.100
So basically, this
size-dependent relaxation

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.950
tends to kind of sharpen
distribution right

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.500
into the aerosol range.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.920
Which is, again,
why we're talking

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.740
about indoor airborne
transmission being dominated

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.330
by these aerosols
that are swirling

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.010
around the well-mixed room.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.320
And that's very different
from transmission

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.600
through coughs or sneezes
of large droplets, which

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.170
are only very briefly present
and then they sediment out.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.600
So if you're not standing
in the way of that cough,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.390
or if the cough is blocked
by a mask or a shield,

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.850
then you really don't have to
worry as much about that form

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:56.960
of transmission.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.970
But as shown here,
you do have to worry

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.400
about the aerosols which
are building up in the air

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.460
and are very strongly related
to all these different factors

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.820
that we've been talking about.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.620
And in fact, maybe I
should also sketch--

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.240
just to help understand
this picture,

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:16.040
maybe I should draw lambda
C as a function of R.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.650
So where this RC is-- again, I
was kind of saying it in words,

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.520
but it's dividing a situation
when you're less than RC,

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.920
where basically these
quantities aren't varying

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.160
too much, to the
situation above where

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.520
it's growing like R squared.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.180
So basically a much
faster relaxation, again,

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:38.140
separating aerosols
from large drops.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.900
So if we substitute
the Stokes velocity

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.230
that we've been talking about
earlier into this formula here,

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.780
we can actually
derive what RC is.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.470
And it comes out to
be the square root

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:56.710
because it is defined with RC
squared of nine halves, that's

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.420
from the Stokes formula.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:02.740
We have lambda a,
the air change rate;

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.410
the effective height of
the room or ceiling height;

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:07.750
the viscosity of air;
and the denominator

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:14.980
is two times the density
of the liquid and gravity.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.230
And this number it
turns out is also

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.240
on the order of a few microns.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.970
So it does depend
on what lambda a is,

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:26.590
but lambda a on the order of
tens of minutes to hours, this

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:27.650
is a kind of range.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:28.480
It can be smaller.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.640
It can be bigger.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.660
In fact, it could be--

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.970
maybe it could even be like
0.5 microns up to 5 microns.

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:39.480
0.5 to 5 microns is
probably more accurate.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.510
But basically, it's
sitting there right about--

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:45.180
as I was trying to sketch here--
in the barrier between aerosols

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.800
and non aerosols.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.470
And also below RC
is actually where

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:55.440
the peak of the distributions
is from typical expiratory

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.560
activities.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.130
And so the point is that
those are not being affected

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.340
very much by sedimentation.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.970
Now the last thing
I'll mention is that

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:06.329
as soon as we have these kind of
size-dependent properties, what

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:08.550
happens to our calculation
of transmission?

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.710
I'll just put the mathematical
formula on the board

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.140
here without really
dwelling on it.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.930
But the way you
can plot what I've

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:20.650
sketched down here for an
actual distribution shown here

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:23.990
would be to substitute it into
the formulas we had before.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:29.190
So for example, what is the
time-dependent transmission

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.180
rate?

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.860
Well remember, that's
Qb times the integral

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.960
over all the sizes now of all
the size-dependent qualities.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:46.820
So it's PM of R, C of R and
t, and C I of R dR, where

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.720
CI is the infectivity.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.170
So basically, as you solve
this [INAUDIBLE] equation here,

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.470
there's sort of change of
the concentration field,

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:56.910
as I've sketched.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.430
You have to then
integrate these curves

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.780
against these other factors--

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.780
the mass factor and the
infectivity factor--

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.670
in order to figure
out the transmission

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:10.270
rate at that moment
through the well-mixed air.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:14.170
And if we solve
this equation here,

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.020
we can actually substitute
back in and get our formula

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:29.140
for beta, which is that beta
of t is Qb squared over v.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.950
So here I'm substituting P
of R. So remember before,

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:37.510
P was basically nd times
C times the infectivity.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:41.080
So that was basically the
production rate of virions

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.550
and we've already
seen that before.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:45.220
And so when I kind of substitute
the solution that we've already

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.500
derived, but just
keeping track of the fact

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.420
that these quantities
are all radius-dependent

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.480
and appear under
the integral, we

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.800
are left with the
integral from zero

00:18:53.800 --> 00:19:01.360
to infinity of Pn of R
squared Cv CI of R. Cv

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.870
is the concentration of virions
per liquid volume or mucous

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.460
volume in the droplet.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.850
CI of R is the infectivity.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:15.940
And let's see, then we have
also an nd of R vd of R,

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.880
where vd of R is
the droplet size.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:24.240
All divided by lambda C of
R, which is all this stuff.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.410
And this integrand is multiplied
by the exponential relaxation,

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:34.200
one minus e to the
lambda C of Rt dR.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.010
So this is your
general formula for

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.520
the time-dependent transmission
rate in a room where

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.610
you can select an actual
distribution that corresponds

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.880
to the infected persons
breathing activity

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.920
and tells you the kinds
of aerosol droplets

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.210
that they are emitting,
and then you basically

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.760
have all these other
parameters to do

00:19:53.760 --> 00:20:00.720
with filtration and airflow and
ventilation, viral deactivation

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.690
and sedimentation.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:03.360
And you finally have
to do this integral

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.050
and you end up with
the transmission rate.
