WEBVTT

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.910
PROFESSOR: So as
a technical aside,

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.760
let me go through and sketch
the derivation of the structure

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.910
of a turbulent jet, in
particular the conical shape

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.160
that we have when the
flow is turbulent.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.280
So in order to study
the mean flow profile

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.020
we began with the
Navier-Stokes equations

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.870
which describe the momentum
conservation and mass

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.160
conservation or continuity of
an incomprehensible so-called

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.220
Newtonian fluid.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.440
So this is a complicated
set of equations.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.270
In particular, we have
this nonlinear term here,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.840
which is the inertial term.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.460
And we've already said that
we had our high Reynolds number

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.010
and turbulence results
because the inertia is

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.080
very strong compared to the
viscous term which is here.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.340
So that's the divergence
of the viscous

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.570
or the viscous
forces on the fluid.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.550
So these two terms we
know are important.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.720
They have to balance and the
inertia is particularly strong

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.800
and it is what leads to the very
complicated flows that we see.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.700
So you can solve these equations
numerically on a computer

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.340
and generate simulations that
look a lot like experiments

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.170
on turbulent jets.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.050
What I'd like to do here is
just to derive by simple scaling

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.690
arguments what sort of the
structure of the solutions

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.170
could look like.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.500
So these two terms,
as we just indicated,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.259
are the ones that are most
likely to balance in the time

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.009
average flow.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:39.380
So let's consider
a time averaged

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:49.130
steady flow which has a
velocity component of v_z

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.360
that depends on r and z.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.270
So it's basically
something like this,

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.720
which is basically
expanding, but has

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.720
a certain sort of localization
of the flow in the middle.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.820
And it's smooth because
we're averaging over all

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.050
the complexity of the jets.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.310
So the jet looks something like
this with all kinds of vortices

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.729
and eddies that
are getting bigger

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.390
as it goes as you're
entraining more

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.470
and more air from the outside.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.470
So we're going to look
at the time average flow.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.230
And we're also going
to, importantly,

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.780
assume that we have
an eddy viscosity.

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.310
So the kinematic viscosity,
nu in the equations

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.820
as I've written them here,
represents the diffusion

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.329
momentum.

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.880
If a parcel of fluid is moving
with a certain momentum,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.400
it has a chance of
passing that momentum

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.829
to the neighboring fluid
and moving it along with it.

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.560
And that is accomplished
through viscous stresses.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.030
So the eddy viscosity
basically assumes

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.340
that that diffusion
process from momentum

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.930
happens at the scale of the
largest eddy in the flow.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.860
And so we've talked about the
assumption of eddy diffusivity.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.630
But for eddy viscosity,
what I'll write

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.140
is the eddy viscosity
is a typical velocity

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.100
which is v_z times a length
scale which is delta.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.100
So what I'm saying
here with this

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.579
is that if I go out to a certain
position z and ask myself,

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.090
what is the sort of width
of the jet at site z,

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.090
then there's all kinds of
eddies but the largest eddy

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.470
is kind of at that scale.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.200
And so if I write
down an eddy viscosity

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.360
it's going to be these
sort of average velocity

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.380
there are times that scale.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.050
So that's going to
be the eddy velocity.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.110
And I'm going to replace--

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.560
so when I do my
time averaging, I'm

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.880
going to replace the
microscopic viscosity

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.220
of the fluid,
kinematic viscosity,

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.560
with the eddy viscosity.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.920
So that's an important
modification.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.910
And so if I do that.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.579
If I do this time averaging
and look at the eddy viscosity,

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.680
then I take these two
terms and balance them,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.550
I'm going to get v_z bar,
so that's my average v_z.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.060
I'm looking at the z
component of momentum

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.300
here of that first
Navier-Stokes equation.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:18.050
And I get v_z dot derivative of
v_z with respect to z plus v_r.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.329
And there's also an r
component of velocity.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.920
So there is also
some velocity in fact

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.930
which is coming
in from the sides.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:33.960
But I'm just going be interested
in this term here v_z dr.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.800
And I'm going to balance this
against the eddy viscosity,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.240
the eddy--

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.040
or nu eddy I should say, sorry,
nu eddy is eddy viscosity--

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:58.140
times and then the Laplacian
in is 1 r d/dr r dv_z dr. So

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.870
that's just the Laplacian in
its cylindrical coordinates.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.210
And now I'm going to make
the assumption that this ve

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.790
scales as v bar z times delta.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.290
And so now I'm going
to do a scaling

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.400
analysis on this equation.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.050
And so what we see is we
have v_z over z times--

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.530
and then at least
for that first so--

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.030
I should say these
two terms will

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.790
be of comparable size
because of incompressibility--

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.820
the second equation.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.550
I won't go through
the details of that.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.170
And we'll just do a
scaling argument

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.280
balancing these two terms.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.470
So if I look at v_z
divided by z times v_z

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.930
so that's a scaling
of those two terms,

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.830
I can balance that
against v_z delta times--

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.280
and the scale for r is delta.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.170
So I have 1/delta
for the 1/r,

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.360
1/delta for
the derivative times

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.560
delta * (1/delta) * v_z.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.770
So there's a lot there.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.460
But notice the v_z's all cancel.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.920
And we're left with a
bunch of deltas here.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.690
And how many, because
of the eddy viscosity,

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.470
we are left with--

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.070
all of this is
just 1 over delta.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.050
This is 1 over z.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.370
And so we find here
the delta scales as z.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.620
So in other words, we
have a conical shape.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.040
So the boundary
of their thickness

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.240
is a constant times z.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.700
And what we write is that
delta is equal to alpha z

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.560
specifically.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.000
And we define the turbulent
entrainment coefficient alpha

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.200
that way.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.700
And then once we've
done that, we've

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:45.790
already shown that
from the momentum flux

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:53.380
that v_z scales as the square
root of k/rho_air

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.100
times 1 over delta.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.990
So this basically now gives
me the scaling of the problem.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.440
In fact, there is a
similarity solution

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.350
for the shape this profile
that one could solve for.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:12.230
And it has the form
that, for example, the v_z

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.290
is square root of--

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.480
because delta is
proportional to z.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.100
So it's the square
root of k over rho

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:28.700
a z times some function
of r over alpha z.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.260
And then there's a
similar expression

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:37.430
for the other
velocity component.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.550
And the function F looks very
much as I've sketched here.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.630
It's essentially a Gaussian
type profile or a bell curve

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.230
that kind of localizes the
velocity across this distance

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.570
delta.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.700
The second thing that
we're interested in

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.460
is the mean concentration.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:05.040
And that would be a
concentration of, let's say,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.390
virions contained in
infectious aerosol droplets.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.040
So there's a mean
concentration profile

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.230
in the jet assuming
that we're injecting

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.270
a fluid of a constant
concentration

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.760
at the source of the jet.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.730
So again, we can do some
scaling arguments here.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.750
So if we ask ourselves,
what is the mass flow

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:31.000
rate through a slice or actually
the volumetric flow rate,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:40.750
use me, that is what is called a
Q and it'll just be an average.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.080
This will be the
average velocity

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.500
times the cross-sectional
area at a given position.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.410
So this is scaling like--

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.470
so area scaled is
like delta squared.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.120
And then the velocity scales
in this way is 1 over delta.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:04.920
So this ends up scaling as k
over rho a times just delta.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.800
So the volumetric flow
rate is increasing

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.370
with r and that's a sign that we
are actually in training fluid

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.180
as I indicated.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.950
This is not just the
fluid we're injecting

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.290
but it's moving forward and
it's sucking more fluid in.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.880
And all that fluid
is kind of becoming

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:24.590
part of the turbulent
jet as it grows.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:30.150
Now if we ask-- so this is
our flow rate, volumetric flow

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.220
rate, but we can
also ask ourselves,

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:39.480
what is the flux
of concentration

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.050
of virions per unit volume.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.930
Well, that would be the
average concentration

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.910
times the average flow
rate because flow rate

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.290
is volume per time
and concentration

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.490
is number per volume.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.870
So this is a total
number per time.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:57.200
And this we will assume
should be a constant

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.450
because as you can
see from this picture,

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.000
if we're injecting a bunch
of concentration of let's say

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.050
droplets here, they will spread
out in the turbulent flow

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.300
but they don't really have
a good mechanism to get out

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.210
of the turbulent flow.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.110
The turbulent flow is
sucking fluid into the plume

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:13.940
and so the particles
are just kind of well

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.400
mixed in that plume and we
could assume they have a roughly

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.570
constant concentration.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:23.870
And so, if that's the case,
and in fact, this constant

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:29.780
would be lambda Q if we're
thinking of, for example,

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:30.530
infect--

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.990
c is the concentration
infection quanta.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:37.340
Then lambda Q is the rate of
admission of infection quanta

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.060
from the mouth.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.870
We've already talked
about that quantity.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.290
And this is now telling me how
the concentration infection

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.300
quanta decays with time.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.750
And so we find if
we substitute now

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:51.920
is that the concentration
infection quanta at a position

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:58.300
z scales as so I have
to divide by Q so I

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.600
get the inverse of this.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.830
So I get square root
of rho a over k.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:09.550
And then I have
lambda Q over alpha z.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:17.850
So this tells me that if I
plot as a function of distance

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.640
from the mouth in the
direction of the jet,

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.150
the concentration
of infection quanta

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:28.170
that are carried by virions
in aerosol droplets,

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.290
then somewhere here I have,
let's say, at z equals 0,

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.850
is the mouth where I'm exhaling.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:40.040
And the concentration
there is actually cQ.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.900
In fact that is
something we've talked

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.140
about before, which is that's
the key disease parameter--

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.140
the concentration of infection
quanta in the exhaled breath

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.430
of an infected person.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.710
So we know at the mouth,
that's what we start with.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.870
And what the turbulent
theory is telling us

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:58.250
is how that concentration
is decaying with time

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.650
and is decaying like 1 over z.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.660
And so that tells us sort of
our relative risk of infection

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.350
in different positions relative
to being mouth to mouth

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.620
with the infected person.
