WEBVTT

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.720
PROFESSOR: So now
let's summarize

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.290
where we've come to in our
analysis of short-range effects

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.100
from respiratory jets
relative to long range

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.830
airborne transmission which
we previously calculated.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.290
And let's also
think about what are

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.310
the implications for policy.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.140
And for personal decisions about
safety during the pandemic.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.760
So first of all,
when masks are worn,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.420
we've already discussed the
filtering effect of masks.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.840
We've talked about
how that brings

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.740
a squared factor of the
mask penetration factor

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.260
which leads to a very
substantial increase

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.190
in the reduction in
the transmission rate.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.690
But there's another
important factor

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.020
when you have a mask, even a
fairly poor mask, a cloth mask,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.320
it may not be so great a
blocking aerosol particles

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.570
but it's very good
at blocking momentum

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.660
so the fluid momentum that
comes from just normal breathing

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.090
is almost completely
stopped by a mask.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.320
Even a vigorous cough only
lets some momentum through

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.900
and a few droplets from
more violent activities

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.110
such as that.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.100
So what's more typical in a case
where people are wearing masks

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.520
is that there is sort of
some exhaled air slowly

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.620
building up around you without
very much additional momentum.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.930
And as we've discussed that air
is warmer and tends to rise.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.960
And so typically
the thermal plume

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.509
of kind of the exhaled
air rising above you a bit

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.289
like a chimney and that's where
the droplets initially reside.

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.590
We're not likely to directly
infect anybody by that method,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.330
either because people
aren't close enough

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.550
or they aren't above
the other person.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.440
And then, of course,
there are other flows

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.650
in the room that
we've discussed,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.729
which are often turbulent.

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.420
And those will transport
the droplets everywhere

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.640
and will lead to
the well-mixed room

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.220
as being the most
natural and most accurate

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.590
first approximation
for the infection risk

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.770
by another person who
is also wearing a mask.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.070
So I would argue that no
strict social distancing is

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.940
required in a mask situation.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.270
So whether we're six
feet or three feet,

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.520
it's not going to give us
substantially more safety

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.170
if people are wearing masks.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.190
And instead we should pay much
more attention to the formula

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.360
that I boxed here,
which gives you

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.470
an estimate of the long range
transmission risks airborne

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.920
which is equally there
for everyone in the room.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.510
And that must be
considered for safety

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.940
and also for contact tracing.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.210
Now situation is very
different without masks.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.079
As we've seen without masks, we
are imparting a lot of momentum

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.940
to the fluid, the air.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.680
Simply by breathing
and certainly

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.960
by talking or singing
or exercising,

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.420
we're really pushing the
air around and launching

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.220
those particles into the air.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.050
And even at three
feet or six feet

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.700
there can be still
a substantial risk.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.150
Although as we
said, the difference

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.800
between three and
six is not so great.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.550
So one might consider
switching to three.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.350
On the other, hand,
even six may not

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.430
be enough protection you
might need to be thinking

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.370
about longer distancing.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.470
And of course, there is
always the airborne risk.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.860
So at some point, you
hit that point x_c

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.400
where the airborne risk is
comparable to the short-range

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.270
risk.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.360
And also there are people such
as the guy I sketched back here

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.220
which are not in
the respiratory jet

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.320
and probably have a lower
risk than the average.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.380
So it's definitely
important to still consider

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.560
the average risk coming from
the long range guideline.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.790
But one could add a correction
to be very conservative

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.220
for cases such as sketched
here when this poor person is

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.760
finding himself or herself
in the respiratory jet

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.510
for long periods of time.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.200
So let's imagine there's a
typical spacing, x bar, which

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.110
would be sort of the
worst case but still

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.720
typical spacing one might expect
of the people in the rooms.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.630
If you think there's a
certain situation where

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.090
maybe two of the people might
be five feet apart or four,

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.100
three feet apart and
facing each other

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.560
for sniffing amounts
of time, and then p jet

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.410
is the probability that
they are encountering

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.060
each other's respiratory jets.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.330
Or maybe put another
way, the fraction

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.730
of the time one person
spends in another person's

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.350
respiratory jet.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.330
When that happens
the transmission

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.280
is just between two people.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.029
It's not to the entire room.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.370
So that's another very important
factor to keep in mind,

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.820
this factor of n, the
occupancy, doesn't really

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.220
come up in the social
distancing model

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.330
here when we're talking about
the indoor reproductive number.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.890
So to make a modified
guideline, we

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.740
can take the long range
indoor reproductive number

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.450
and add a short
range correction.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.159
We've already calculated
what this looks like.

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.440
So if I write the
guideline as n minus 1 tau

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.520
is less than epsilon
over the average beta,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.270
I can also restore
what that means here.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.710
Average beta times tau is the
integral, time interval data,

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.010
basically, of the
transmission rate.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.470
And so this fact
that we've already

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.300
calculated the ratio
of the shortrange term

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.630
to the longer term
is x_c over x--

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.670
or x bar times p jet.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.230
It's a very simple correction.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.310
If we plug back in our estimates
for this average beta then

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.610
we arrive at this formula here.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.950
The first term is the same
guideline we already have.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.680
And there's a new term
now which, notice,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.230
does not involve n and
doesn't have the mass factor,

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.030
of course, as well.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.030
But it involves the length,
so social distancing.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.240
And it involves the mouth
area and the breathing rate.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.150
The breathing rate
now is also not

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.070
coming in square
because we're assuming

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.710
that the breath is already
providing this concentration.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.960
And we're just looking at
another distance downstream.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.450
And the Qb is for the receiving
person's inhaling breath rate

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.210
whereas the QB squared comes
from inhaling and exhaling

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.980
and finding the steady
state in the room.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.620
And so we've already
estimated how big

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.230
this term is [? xc ?]
over x might be anywhere

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:53.500
from one to 100 or maybe even
1,000 if you let p jet be 1.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.320
So if you stand facing
another person continuously,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.890
this can be a large term and
can actually dominate the other.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.190
I'll notice there's an n there.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.920
So still, there
could be a balance.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.300
But when you take into account
that people are not always

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.700
directly facing
each other so much,

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.380
then this number might
be a lot smaller.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.050
And I would argue
that in many cases

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.290
the dominant term is
the long range one.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.070
And the short range
one is the correction.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.670
But one should be
aware of situations

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.060
where the short-range
effect could be dominant.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.860
And so that must
also be considered.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.260
And this modified guideline
here would be one way

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.710
to take that into account.
