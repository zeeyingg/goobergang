00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.230
JULIAN BEINART:
Anyway, I'd better

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.700
abbreviate all this stuff
that I want to cover today.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.410
The next three classes
are going to cover

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:55.500
cases of very complex,
but very direct,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.100
relationships between social
and spatial structure.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.420
There is a literature
largely from the left side

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.680
of the market on these issues.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.190
I don't have time to go
through much of this here.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.430
You should read the
required reading

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.130
for this class,
Kevin Lynch's piece--

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.540
chapter on social and spatial
structure relationships.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:48.430
On the left, I would
assume the argument--

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.630
that space is an active agent,
that it involves conflict,

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.910
that it's political--

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.020
and this is an argument that
is articulated very well

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.980
by Henri Lefebvre in the
translation of his writing

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.229
into English.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.460
David Harvey's first book,
Social Justice In The City,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.180
argues that, under capitalism,
investment will never

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.040
stream towards the poorer
sections of the society,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.920
because capitalism has so
many circuits of investment.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.260
An object of
capitalist investment

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.680
is always maximizing profit.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.020
There are less
attractive writings

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:51.330
by Manuel Castells in his
pre-Berkeley stage, the book,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.390
The Urban Question,
and so on, and so on.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.480
There's David Gordon's
writing about the origins

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.980
of American suburbia as
being the result of labor

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.470
friction in the
central business area,

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.850
and the bosses wanting to move
as far away from the workers as

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.140
possible.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.990
And there are many
histories of this kind.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.170
Castells' piece,
The Wild City, which

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.090
argues that suburbia is a
form of advanced capitalist

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.690
investment in which you
have to create markets

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.200
for prolific domestic
goods, and suburbia

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.680
is an attractive avenue
for this kind of market.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.025
His writing is
called The Wild City.

00:03:47.025 --> 00:03:50.920
He claims the American
city wild in the sense

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.630
that it obeys the
consequences of market action

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.430
in a very obvious kind of way.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.250
It's not hidden or transformed.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.010
There's an enormous
amount of writing.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.550
There's this writing and from
the center and the right.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.190
In Sunday's New
York Times, there's

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.340
a piece called "Suburban
Disequilibrium."

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.945
I don't know if anybody
looks at these things.

00:04:31.945 --> 00:04:37.800
It simply says that suburbs
are an equal, something

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.890
that one would presume to know.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.400
And the reason suburbs
are unequal are given,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.650
and they haven't changed--

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.900
and not much has changed.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.460
She cites examples of
suburbs close together

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.986
in Los Angeles, where one
house sells for $68 million.

00:05:00.986 --> 00:05:03.605
And a few miles away,
there's a suburb

00:05:03.605 --> 00:05:07.580
of Mexican-American
workers who can barely

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.915
afford to buy their house.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.390
In teaching this material,
I found over the years

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:29.240
that the material is very
much stretched to large ideas

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.100
about economic science
and social policy.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.440
There's very little discussion
of the meaning of place.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.650
Donald Appleyard has written
about that and some others--

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.330
what place means, what space
means to people, and so on.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.040
So I've decided to
follow a different route

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.000
in dealing with this.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.280
I've established a notion
called "bipolarity"

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:16.220
and chosen cases where the
conflict between various groups

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:27.090
in the city is very explicit
and under different conditions.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:36.390
So we will examine Johannesburg
from its origins in 1876,

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:45.210
I think, to today, following a
path of explicit racial policy.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:52.070
South Africa invented or
formalized racial policy

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.700
to an extent that no other
country and no other state

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.950
in the world ever has.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.960
So we should look at
Johannesburg and what

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.320
this space of Johannesburg
looks like as a result

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.760
of the enforcement of absolute
inequities between White

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.040
and Black.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.390
We should look at
the colonial city.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.760
We look at Delhi and New Delhi.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:22.430
We look at the border between
Mexico and the United States

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:30.890
and look at the polarity
between country and city

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.765
in the development of Havana.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.020
Today's class is really
dealing with the mother

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.120
of all social complexities,
and that's Jerusalem.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.310
I want to do a case
study on Jerusalem.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:54.020
And just for those of you
who haven't read the required

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.220
reading for today--

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.290
which is a long piece which
I wrote after months of work,

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.810
and I'm so sad that
you haven't read it--

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.470
I'll go through the very--

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.520
let me just explain what
I've handed out to you.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.460
After this, the
map of the history

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:23.200
of Jerusalem, a simplified
history, on the next page

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:23.785
is a drawing.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.620
It's a drawing on a napkin
by the head of the planning

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:36.330
section of MOPIC, the
Palestinian organization

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:41.280
after the Oslo Accords, which
I worked with for a while.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.880
This was the depiction of
the future of Jerusalem--

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:51.210
as one metropolitan area with
the Jewish sect on the West,

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:55.050
and the Palestinian
sect on the right,

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.380
and the historic
center in the middle.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:07.250
Below that is a letter,
which is obvious,

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.810
pointing out the
stupidity of some

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.370
of the writing on this issue.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:19.160
So what I'm going to
do is try to take you

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.560
through a history,
which starts off

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.010
as a history, for a
long time, a history

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:35.990
of religious consequence,
and transforms much later

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:40.040
and in recent times,
certainly in this century,

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.540
into a geopolitical conflict.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.255
And we end up with
the status quo.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.720
Let's follow this
map very briefly.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.700
The origins of Jerusalem
are, again, political.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:11.280
For Palestinians, it
talks about the Jebusites,

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.440
and the Canaanites, and
the origins of the city

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:22.800
prior to 1,000 BC,
which is the date

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:30.690
that the Davidian City, the City
of David, argues its beginning.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.150
David captures Jerusalem,
according to this.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.760
This is an Israeli map.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:48.190
According to the
Israeli history,

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:52.750
David bought the threshing
fields on the Temple Mount

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:57.610
from the Jebusites for 15
shekels, the equivalent

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:00.310
amount of money.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:08.560
And in order to unify the
spread out of Jewish tribes,

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.970
he built the first--

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:16.660
he was a lover, and a
poet, and a general,

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.170
and according to
strict Hebrew law,

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.690
was not able to build a temple.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:29.110
So his son, Solomon, was the
author of the first temple.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.780
I'll show you a
drawing, by Corbusier

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:44.050
of the tribal environment,
which the Jews, and most people,

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.750
established at the time.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:54.550
And the drawing shows the temple
as the first physical presence

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.195
in a city.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.960
Seeing that the religious
city for a long time

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.680
just depended on a
religious infrastructure,

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.795
it's clear that
the first temple--

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:21.910
this temple exists for about
500 years, during which time

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:27.920
the Middle East undergoes
sieges and invasions.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.650
The most significant
invasion is by Nebuchadnezzar

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.860
in the 6th Century.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.490
This has enormous
consequences historically,

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:44.380
and I tend to
exaggerate some of them.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:49.270
Nebuchadnezzar came from
the world's greatest city

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:56.320
at the time, Babylon, the
most advanced city of all.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.250
Instead of killing the Jews,
he took them back with him

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:05.560
as prisoners and allowed the
Jews to establish themselves

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.340
in Babylon in a
relatively free manner.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.160
Why he did that, which
was very contrary

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:21.010
to social international behavior
at the time, I don't know.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:26.140
What happened was
significant for the Jews.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.200
Not having a temple,
not having priests,

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.140
you must understand
the organization

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.480
of the social structure
around the temple.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.540
The temple was run by priests.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.610
There was no
democracy in religion.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:46.300
You took what the
priests gave you,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:53.350
and the priests were monitors
of the Holy of the Holies.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:57.190
If you look at the plans
putated for the first temple,

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:01.030
you will see that structure.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:04.720
The Jews didn't have temples.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.000
They either had to
give up their religion

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.100
or convert to some
other pagan religion.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:24.790
Having been the first
monoethicists of all, having--

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.850
monotheism was
founded in Jerusalem.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.280
Nobody quite knows how.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.000
But the idea that many
gods were dysfunctional,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.320
and that the single God,
an invisible single God,

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:46.230
was the proper course
for religious faith.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.870
So the Jews prayed in
houses and in schools--

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.520
wherever they could.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.815
This type substitution
was an extraordinary idea.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:05.720
In the history of the
Church, I found a reference

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.700
to saying that this
was the beginning

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:15.710
of the idea of the
church free of the rule

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:21.140
of plutocratic priests.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.170
People could indulge in
a critical examination

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:29.670
of their faith
together as a group.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.390
In fact, the conflict
towards the end

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:37.340
of the Jewish reign in
Jerusalem at the time of Jesus

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.910
was very much a conflict
between the priests

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:45.410
of the Second Temple
and the Pharisees,

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:46.850
who were advocating--

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.790
beginning to advocate
the democratic religion

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.430
in the form of the synagogue.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:56.810
So the synagogue emerges
in primitive form

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.930
in the exile of a Jewish
group from the temple.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.970
There's a second
phenomenon which

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.970
occurs during this period.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.790
In the Judeo-Christian
Bible, there

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:17.480
are seven chapters
devoted to Ezekiel.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.210
Who was Ezekiel?

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:24.432
What role did he play in the--

00:16:24.432 --> 00:16:25.640
you should know these things.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:31.160
You all are
Christians, or Muslims,

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.250
or any other form of religion.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:38.240
You know nothing about
your own religion?

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:46.030
Maybe you're all pagans, which
would be refreshing, I suppose.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.880
AUDIENCE: He was a Catholic?

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:54.740
JULIAN BEINART: Well,
Ezekiel had a dream.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:55.600
He was a prophet.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.830
He had a dream that God and
he encountered each other,

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:05.109
and he had instructions
to devise a new temple.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:11.619
There are six chapters in your
Bible on Ezekiel's dimensions

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:17.380
for this new temple.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:22.690
Imagine dreaming of a
temple when you're in exile

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:27.910
and designing it in
your mind as a text.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:31.720
Anyway, strange things happen.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:36.160
Ezekiel's temple, as I'll
show you in the slides,

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:41.510
has been redrawn and reimagined
from these dimensions

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.175
over time.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.220
The Jews return, and
the third significance

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:57.400
of the stay in Babylon,
the Jewish Talmud,

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.190
the Book of Laws,
has two versions,

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.010
the Palestinian version--

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.820
at least the Jerusalem version
and the Babylonian version.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.160
The Babylonian
version is considered

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.520
to be the preferred version.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.920
So the Jews in exile
established a culture,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.510
which they brought back to
Jerusalem having been freed,

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:26.170
and Israel read the Bible to
the people for the first time.

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.575
And according to
the text, they wept.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.450
So the beginning of
the idea that religion

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:40.690
is a democratic phenomenon
is my explanation

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.870
for the problem of Jesus.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:48.700
I've a rather eccentric
version of the story.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:54.490
What happened is
we jump 500 years,

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:58.600
and Herod goes and
rebuilds the temple.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.255
He builds an enormous
temple-- bigger than before.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.480
The priests, again,
are in control.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.530
They control power.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:19.640
They control the
artifact of religion.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.230
They control property.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.315
They control
everything in the city.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:30.980
Along comes a Jew,
a radical Jew--

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.440
has another vision of the world.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:42.490
Jesus doesn't threaten
the Romans very much.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:46.740
The Romans are used to dealing
with whatever in the empire,

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.010
with infidels.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:52.530
They just lock them up
or cut their heads off--

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.600
very explicit rules.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.570
[INAUDIBLE] in a rather
difficult situation.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:09.010
The priests are more threatened
by Jesus than other Romans.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:13.540
The priests, therefore,
connive with the Romans

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.930
to execute Jesus.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:21.760
The notion of
execution of your son

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.620
occurs in the Judeo-Christian
Bible before, and although it

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:30.610
wasn't legal, the idea
of passing your son

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:37.630
on as a gift, the use of blood.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:41.490
22,000 oxen were killed
in the dedication

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.645
of the Temple of Solomon.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.610
The whole idea of giving
something to God as a gift--

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:56.580
if you were poor, you brought
a chicken to the temple

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.530
to the priest.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:02.550
If you were wealthy, you
brought a cow, an ox.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:05.010
If you were very
wealthy, good Lord knows,

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.230
you donated your son.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:11.460
The story of Abraham and
Isaac is that same version

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:15.630
of that gift giving.

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:19.200
The supreme gift is
the gift of your son.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.580
And the Jesus story
is archetypally

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:31.290
the story of God
donating his son, again,

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:35.160
for the improvement
of the world.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:41.640
Christianity is based on
many mythical stories, which

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.340
emanated from the
history of Jerusalem,

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:48.025
and is the second monotheistic
religion to emerge out

00:21:48.025 --> 00:21:48.525
of the city.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:02.480
Muhammad is born in 570 BC.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:07.620
He fights his battles
in Mecca and Medina,

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.970
spreads the idea of Islam as
the third great monotheistic

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.530
religion through the
Arabian Peninsula,

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:20.340
and soon afterwards,
Jerusalem is invaded

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.190
by the first Arab group.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:31.510
Significantly, the
Christians had chosen

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:35.890
a site for the great church.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:41.190
Constantine's mother,
Helena, from Istanbul

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:45.100
or Constantinople,
drifted down to Jerusalem,

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.860
and he's supposed to have
selected the site where

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.500
Jesus was killed.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.450
On the basis of
that information,

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.600
the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher was built

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.200
and is still in existence
today, having been destroyed

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:04.810
seven times and rebuilt.

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.700
The Arabs arrive in Jerusalem.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:10.270
They're the newcomers.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:18.100
They asked the Christian
bishop about sites

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.915
for their own mosque.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:29.710
The Temple Mount, which had been
the site of the Jewish temple,

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.640
had been raised by the Romans,
and there was nothing left.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.030
For 500 years, the
Temple Mount was

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:40.690
a rubbish dump of old parts
of buildings and so on.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:43.670
The Christians wanted
nothing to do with it.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:48.430
In fact, the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher, which was usually

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:55.420
under the Roman city, entered
from The Cardo on the West,

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.510
at least on the
East, was closed.

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:02.350
And you now enter the
Church of the Holy Sepulcher

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.510
only from the South.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:07.840
On the East now, there's
the best candy store

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.415
in Jerusalem on The Cardo.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:21.130
So although the Temple
Mount, which is only two--

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.870
to use their phrase--

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:26.800
two-arrow lengths,
bow lengths, away

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:33.670
from the Church of
the Holy Sepulcher,

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:43.610
the Islamic penetrators thought
that the mythological origins

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:48.380
of the use of the Temple
Mount were sufficient for them

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:54.800
to follow the Jewish tradition
of the destroyed temple.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:59.570
So they rebuilt the Temple
Mount in about 100 years

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:08.080
after Mohammad's birth and
built the two buildings

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.550
which are still there today--

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.670
The Dome of the Rock
and the Al-Aqsa mosque.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.680
In my writing, I go through
the detailed history

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:24.650
of the idea of resilience,
how under these occupations

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:28.490
each religion plays around
with the idea of permanence.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:39.310
The Christians in
the Holy Sepulcher

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:43.600
never really agree
on the fundamentals

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.100
of the Christian faith.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.620
Whilst they may agree
on the fundamentals,

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.440
they don't agree
on its application.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:57.010
So 70% of the Holy Sepulcher
is still under Greek Christian.

00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:03.790
The poor African Ethiopian
Christians live on the roof

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:08.350
and are only allowed to
enter the major tabernacle

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:12.250
by a small staircase.

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:18.230
As one of the writers
writes, "They're

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:23.380
all divided by faith," or
something of this kind.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:31.930
So you have a notion of the
three major religions having,

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:37.828
in the case of the
Christians, an artifact which

00:26:37.828 --> 00:26:41.980
houses divided aspects
of the religion.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:42.940
There are fires.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.240
They are people killed.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:48.340
There are all kinds
of disjunctions

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:53.050
between these groups, but
Christianity survives.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:57.550
On the Islamic front,
you have the church,

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:00.730
the Dome of the Rock, and the
Al-Aqsa mosque, which survive

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.520
to this day unblemished.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.870
In 1099, the Crusaders,
under the pressure

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:11.710
from the popes of
Europe, attempt

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:14.100
to restore Christianity.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.980
Instead of dismant--
they are absolutely

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:26.530
ruthless to the degree that they
kill everybody in their sight.

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:29.620
They kill Muslims and Jews.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.560
And in the blood of
their boots, they

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.320
walk to the Holy
Sepulcher and pray.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:42.490
There's always this kind of
interesting biblical thing,

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:46.480
which I focus on also, that
the interpretation of God

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.730
is always ambiguous.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:54.580
God is always punishing people
for doing the wrong things,

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:59.050
but he's also forgiving, if
you come to terms with him--

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:04.700
or her, depending
on what you believe.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:11.740
So the Crusaders behave in
this apparently bifocal way.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:19.060
They destroy everybody whom they
see in their sight violently,

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:25.690
and at the same time, they go
and sing hymns in their church.

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:31.150
There may be parallels in
contemporary violence as well.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:36.550
I don't know if it's a
born-in instinct in humankind,

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:41.530
that you modify your
behavior in two distinct ways

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:46.060
according to your belief system.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.570
The Jews have lost two temples.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.000
They now are in exile.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.560
They take with them books.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.881
That's the only
property they have.

00:28:56.881 --> 00:29:05.110
There's writers-- Herschel,
the American Jewish liberal

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:10.390
theological rabbi, Mitchell
[INAUDIBLE] did his PhD

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:11.590
at MIT--

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:15.970
write about the idea
of the Jewish book

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:21.580
as the significant
property of memory.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.800
They argue that,
in fact, they are--

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.580
I think it's Herschel that
talks about the Jewish religion

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:32.540
as being a religion of
the architecture of time.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:38.140
If you look at the layout
of a text in the Mishnah,

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.800
you'll see a body of writing.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:47.230
And on the sides are
Talmudic interpretations

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:50.540
by rabbis over time.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:56.260
So the truth is never
absolute in this one sense--

00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:01.190
that it's always
open to discussion.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:04.240
It's also that the Jews
took upon themselves--

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:09.280
and Freud himself, who at
one time thought about going

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.510
to live in Jerusalem--

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:17.620
says that the Jews
preoccupied themselves

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.770
with avoiding pictorial imagery.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:24.580
You cannot decorate
the synagogue.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:29.080
The text has to be
absolutely pure.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.340
Jews didn't become architects.

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.390
They were never in a
power position in exile

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:36.160
for thousands of years--

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.990
well, not thousands of years.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:40.660
Peter Eisenman and his--

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.190
Frank Gehry are Jewish.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:46.540
And I suppose that we've
made up for that lost time.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:55.510
But the Jewish
presence after 70 AD

00:30:55.510 --> 00:31:01.690
was in exile until the
slow return of the Jews

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:12.570
in the Ottoman period, which
lasted from about 1500 to 1917.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:16.350
I hope you're following all
of these detailed stories.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:21.360
But in a sense,
it's only by looking

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.840
at the detailed
side of the stories

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.260
that you really get a good
idea of the complexity

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.060
of the situation.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.920
To say Arab--

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.210
I mean, of the 3,000 years
of the history of Jerusalem,

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:39.870
1,200 years would be under
the Israelites or the Jews,

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:42.510
and 1,200 years under
the Arabs or Islam.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:50.685
Whatever that means, the rest is
divided amongst the Christians

00:31:50.685 --> 00:31:51.310
and the Romans.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.990
Jerusalem was, in
the first place,

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:59.840
not a particularly
important city.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:00.910
It was too steep.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:10.130
The main circulation
path was to the West

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:13.340
along the Mediterranean.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:20.210
Jerusalem was the last connector
between the coastal plain

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:24.375
and the endless desert, which
stretched all the way to India.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:32.850
The Dead Sea close to Jerusalem
was the lowest point on Earth.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:35.790
So there was-- I'll show
you a slide indicating

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:39.390
this division, geographical
division, on which Jerusalem

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:41.160
sits.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:45.210
Alexander the Great
visited Jerusalem.

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:49.650
This was an enormous
victory for the Jews.

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:56.160
Many Jews, including my
son, are named Alexander

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.890
because of that tradition.

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:03.690
His first name is Peter, but
his second name is Alexander.

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:10.380
I named him after the
Russian giants rather

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.555
and Jewish heroes.

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:26.810
So Zionism, as a
phenomenon, occurs in Europe

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:32.420
as a consequence of the
marginalization of Jews

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:39.360
in Central Europe and all the
way to England and France,

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.982
the disposition of Jewish land.

00:33:41.982 --> 00:33:45.990
The Jews, under
one of the early I

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:49.830
think 12th century English
kings, had to wear labels

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:52.830
marking them as Jews--

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.410
the pogroms of Eastern Europe.

00:33:55.410 --> 00:34:03.000
I mean, it's a long history
which precedes the Holocaust.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.090
And Jewish reaction to
persecution and punishment

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:13.320
took the form of a biblical
notion of "next year

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.090
in Jerusalem."

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:17.519
In the Jewish Passover
service, there

00:34:17.519 --> 00:34:21.510
is this phrase, "next
year, in Jerusalem."

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:25.320
The Jewish Passover, unlike
the Christian Easter,

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:30.120
is not dedicated very
much to a religious idea,

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:38.920
but related to the escape
under Moses from Egypt and God

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:44.270
parting the Red Sea to
allow the Jews to escape.

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:50.060
How true that story is, whether
Freud claims that Moses was,

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:56.375
in fact, an Egyptian who
had learned about it.

00:34:56.375 --> 00:35:01.400
Well, anyway, there
are too many stories.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.130
When you get all of
these people having

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:09.810
been involved in this
dialogue, on this multilogue,

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:12.750
you have many stories.

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:18.600
The Ottoman Empire chooses to
take the wrong side in the 1418

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.840
war, and the British
take over Jerusalem.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.210
They maintain
Jerusalem as a mandate

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:31.290
until 1948, when the
War of Independence

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:36.660
and the Jewish state of Israel
was founded 70 years ago now.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:46.120
East Jerusalem belongs to
Jordan, West Jerusalem,

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.470
to Israel.

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:53.220
1967, there's another war.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:36:00.880
This time, the Jews expel
Jordan from East Jerusalem,

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:05.605
and in fact, annex the West
Bank to a united Israel.

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:12.850
The United Nations
proposes that Jerusalem

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:17.020
be an international city.

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:21.190
They actually have a diagram
of the form of Jerusalem

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.500
as an international city.

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:30.370
Neither side, neither
Arab nor Jewish politics,

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:32.560
accept that as a resolution.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:41.680
The Jews start, after the
Oslo Accords, which presumably

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:46.540
sets out that there would be an
independent Palestinian state,

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:51.850
and talks about the
'67 boundary lines

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:55.780
and zones for the future states.

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:04.870
Israel politics, a combination
of religious pressure

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:15.010
and all kinds of other
internal Israeli social issues,

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:18.070
promote the expansion
program, which

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:21.910
now has reached
300,000 settlers living

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:30.810
on land, which is East of the
partition line set by the Oslo

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:31.310
Accords.

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:41.800
Many American presidents,
since Harry Truman I think,

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:46.300
have objected to Israeli
settlement expansion,

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.250
with no results whatsoever.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:55.630
The status quo, at the end of
all of my long story of 3,000

00:37:55.630 --> 00:38:01.240
years, is a situation
in which Jerusalem

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:06.290
is claimed by Israel to be
the unique capital of Israel.

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:09.130
Although, as you will
read in my letter,

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:14.320
many of the previous
Israeli presidents

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.380
have looked for
alternative sites

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:24.460
to Jerusalem, at least for the
capital of Israel, including

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.845
Ben-Gurion's choice of
coordinate in the Negev.

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:40.180
At present, the
Palestinian position

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.580
is a slightly more
complex position,

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:46.450
but they would like
to share Jerusalem

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:50.450
as the capital of
their state as well.

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:55.090
So you have a notion, which
I don't think exists anywhere

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:56.980
else in the world,
where one city is

00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.800
the capital of two countries.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:06.230
You get St. Louis, Missouri
and St. Louis, Kansas City.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:11.690
You have divisions in
other parts of the world,

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:15.080
but you have no claim
for a city as being

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.180
the capital of two states.

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:24.680
In fact, the notion of two
states is now under discussion.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.380
There's a new,
relatively new, movement,

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:32.150
which argues for the existence
of a single state, which

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:35.240
would alleviate the
problem of the settlements,

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:38.450
but deny Zionist ambitions.

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:44.260
Because demographically,
the Jewish position

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:49.330
is more vulnerable
demographically.

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:52.990
This two-state solution,
which the United States

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:59.710
and most liberal
politicians support,

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:03.175
is for there to be an
independent Palestinian state.

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:10.990
The Palestinians wish to go
back to the 1967 boundary.

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:13.150
They'll have to be
some compromise.

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:15.280
God knows how that
compromise is going

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.540
to be worked out between
the size of the settlement

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:25.750
population and the
emaciated, fragmented--

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:30.430
you can see in the last
map in your handout,

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:34.760
just in the case of the
periphery of Jerusalem,

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:47.960
how much this land has become
parcelized and fragmented

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:48.905
rather than unified.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:41:01.850
My son's book, which tackles
this problem much more

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:11.270
eloquently than I can, argues
that for a Palestinian state,

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:16.150
which is liberal and not
imposing military law

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:19.880
onto the Palestinians
in the West Bank,

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:23.060
and so on, and so
on, is probably

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:26.420
the most coherent
liberal position

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:28.700
on the subject at the moment.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:33.500
The future of Jerusalem
may well be never resolved.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:44.940
It may be the result of too much
history and too much mythology.

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:49.050
Mythology becomes history
at a certain point.

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:51.360
Let me give you an example.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:57.450
Christians, at Easter today,
celebrate the way of the cross.

00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:00.330
They carry the
cross symbolically

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:04.500
from the praetorium
where Jesus was housed

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:09.370
to where he was crucified.

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:13.510
The site of the crucifixion
is not absolutely clear,

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:18.790
but most people now assume it
to be somewhere around where

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:22.300
the sepulcher is.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:27.610
One of the stations of
the cross, station number

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:29.710
I don't know what--

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:32.710
number seven, I'm
not sure exactly--

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:36.460
it's called the
Ecce Homo station.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:46.065
That's where the Roman Legion
commander pointed down to Jesus

00:42:46.065 --> 00:42:47.510
and said, ecce homo--

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:52.400
look at that man, look at this
man in a derisive manner--

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.770
carrying the cross.

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:59.340
In fact, history proves that
to be absolutely nonsense,

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:01.740
but a complete myth.

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:07.800
Archeologists say that the Ecce
Homo Arch was only built long

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:15.160
after Jesus' death and didn't
exist at the time of Jesus.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:24.210
So the other
conflations of reality,

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:30.690
the Jews are near
the citadel of David

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:36.660
have the site of David's
tomb, above which Christians

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:46.550
claim the Last Supper of Jesus
with his followers took place.

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:51.860
It is now the site of the
Dormitian Abbey, which is

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.005
where Mary was supposedly died.

00:43:54.005 --> 00:43:55.910
[ITALIAN] Mary--

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:58.970
[ITALIAN] being the
Italian word to sleep--

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:00.650
Dormitian Abbey.

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:03.110
So you have a vertical.

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:06.650
As the history of this
city has grown and layered

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:11.450
upon each other, physically
you have Jewish David

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:12.800
at the bottom.

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:19.130
Jesus is next on top, and
the Ottoman Empire and Mary's

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:22.610
memory on the top.

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:26.450
What do you do about
a place like this?

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:28.760
You fossilize it.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.070
In my letter, in
The New Republic,

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:33.770
I say that it's not
only a religious city.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:37.550
It's an everyday city in
which people go to school.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:40.320
People have
transportation problems.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.190
The Jews have just built
a light rail system.

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.390
It's a political city.

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:57.300
It never was the capital of any
of the country's Arab countries

00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.970
that conquered Jerusalem.

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:03.480
I'll show you a
slide of Jerusalem

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:07.560
only being the capital
of the Crusader

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:11.970
empire and the Jewish empire.

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:15.600
What justification that makes
for arguing that Jerusalem

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.880
should be the unique capital
of Israel is for you to decide.

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:29.820
This is the most--

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:33.270
I mean, I can give you many
detailed stories and versions

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.400
of any of these events.

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:46.760
For instance, in a religious
environment of this kind,

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:50.780
it's amazing how
frequently people

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:55.230
build on the sites of previous
religious institutions.

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:57.740
The Church of the
Holy Sepulcher is

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:03.050
built on the site of the
Roman temple of Aphrodite.

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:07.850
When the Crusaders
capture Jerusalem in 1099,

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:11.720
they go, they march,
to the Dome of the Rock

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.520
and the Al-Aqsa mosque.

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.680
And instead of
putting them down,

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:19.520
they put a Christian flag on
top of the Dome of the Rock

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:22.400
and called the
Temple of Dominus.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:26.420
And the Al-Aqsa mosque
becomes Temple Salomonis.

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:30.260
Al-Aqsa mosque has
its foundations

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:34.100
in Solomon's temple stables.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:37.800
It is constantly-- its
roof is constantly--

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.060
its lead roof is constantly
having to be repaired,

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:44.190
because its foundations
are so unstable.

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:46.942
This is the city which is built.

00:46:46.942 --> 00:46:50.510
I write in the last
part of my writing

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:55.430
on Louis Kahn's Hurva synagogue.

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:56.810
Well, if you
haven't read it, I'm

00:46:56.810 --> 00:47:00.620
not going to tell you the story
of Louis Kahn's interpretation

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:05.165
of how you build in Jerusalem,
his theory of ruins.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:17.190
So today, the Islam has two
permanent monuments, ways,

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:19.710
people can pray.

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:22.350
The Jews don't have any.

00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:25.260
They pray in the open air.

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.440
The holiest presence
is in the Western Wall,

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:35.610
which is eroding in ancestry.

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:41.970
And the Christians still have
the desecrated holy place

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:45.900
of the Sepulcher,
Christ's passion--

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:49.020
the location of
Christ's passion.

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:58.480
And such is an abbreviated
story of Jerusalem.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:59.530
Now, what do you do?

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.670
I worked for the
Palestinian side.

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:08.130
I worked not for the
Israeli government,

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:12.700
but for the mayor of
Jerusalem over time.

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:17.040
So my investment in this
city is more than just

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.250
knowing its history, which
I only know partially.

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:23.520
The history of religion
is so extensive

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.320
that to understand it all--

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:30.810
I don't even understand
who Gabriel was.

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:33.330
The figure is in
some story somewhere.

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:42.920
I mean, the books
about the Last Supper,

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:47.150
which talk about the
tradition of eating together

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:50.570
and what that means, the
book's about the killing

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:51.605
of your first son--

00:48:54.380 --> 00:49:01.370
remember the one of the plagues
that the Egyptians or God cast

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:04.820
on the Egyptians for the
persecution of the Jews

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:07.010
was the killing
of the first son.

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:11.300
That's why the baby Moses
was hidden in the reeds.

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:20.120
We can go on and on,
and on and on, and on.

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:23.450
Religion is a business which
produces lots of myths,

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:27.290
and realities, and
interpretations to keep

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:28.025
itself going.

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:40.600
OK, we should look at
some of these pictures

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.290
so you get a better idea of
what this place looks like.

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:54.750
The options are simple.

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:02.610
This is the present Israeli
option for Jerusalem.

00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:05.610
If this is Palestine
and this is Israel,

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:10.950
Jerusalem has a secure
border on its East side.

00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:18.425
This is a metropolitan
city, as indicated

00:50:18.425 --> 00:50:22.250
in the drawing of the
Palestinian planner

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:24.656
with the central.

00:50:24.656 --> 00:50:28.820
The problem of what happens
on a boundary between two

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:32.900
countries in terms of
security and customs

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:36.440
isn't answered by one.

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.120
You have to dispense with it.

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:41.180
You can only dispense
with that if you

00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:43.010
have secure relationship.

00:50:45.632 --> 00:50:50.440
The European Union has
dispensed with passports

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:57.390
by virtue of an assumption
that there is no reason

00:50:57.390 --> 00:51:03.390
to maintain fortified borders
any longer between France

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:07.010
and Belgium, for instance.

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:12.050
But can you conceive of this
being a solution in relation

00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:17.540
to two pretty hostile entities?

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:21.050
How are you going to deal with
security in a unified city--

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:25.060
small details?

00:51:30.016 --> 00:51:31.930
The historic site has--

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:44.110
if an Iraqi wishes to
visit the Dome of the Rock,

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:52.610
he or she has to penetrate
some kind of a line,

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:55.130
or presumably
there is line which

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:59.330
has to be penetrated at all.

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:04.550
This is a position
where Palestine

00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:11.150
encircles Jerusalem in the
counterpoint to this proposal.

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:12.970
Are there any other
possibilities?

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.200
What do you think
at the back there?

00:52:21.872 --> 00:52:23.197
AUDIENCE: Possibility for what?

00:52:23.197 --> 00:52:24.030
JULIAN BEINART: Hmm?

00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:25.947
AUDIENCE: Possibility for what?

00:52:25.947 --> 00:52:27.780
JULIAN BEINART: For the
future of Jerusalem,

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:29.280
given either one or--

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:33.180
given a one-state solution,
there's no problem.

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:36.040
It's the capital
of a single state.

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.975
But if it's the--

00:52:38.975 --> 00:52:42.900
another solution is a
version of number 1--

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:51.430
that the Ramallah, the United
States, and the European Union

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:54.580
give a billion dollars
to the Palestinians

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:55.645
to build a new capital.

00:52:58.225 --> 00:53:01.280
AUDIENCE: It's not a question
of where other people want

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:04.180
them to put the capital.

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:10.470
[INAUDIBLE] for Israel the same.

00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:13.850
There's two sides of Jerusalem.

00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:15.153
JULIAN BEINART: I understand.

00:53:15.153 --> 00:53:16.820
AUDIENCE: There is a
place to divide it.

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:21.480
There is a divide, without there
being a political division.

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:25.410
There is a community
that's divided.

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:28.420
The problem is that it's
the issue of security

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:31.390
and whether everybody from--

00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:33.370
what the Palestinians
can control

00:53:33.370 --> 00:53:36.970
who comes right up to the
edge of the Israeli side

00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:38.590
or the Jewish side.

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:40.190
That's the problem.

00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:43.720
JULIAN BEINART: I understand.

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:49.150
What I'm concluding is
that there is no solution

00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:54.550
and that this will just
perpetuate itself in history,

00:53:54.550 --> 00:54:00.820
causing bloodshed as blood
accompanies this history

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:04.030
of Jerusalem for
2,000, 3,000 years.

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:07.990
That it'll just continue to be--

00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:13.450
it is too intoxicated a site
by the virtue of the three

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:16.510
major religions in the world.

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:18.610
Forgive me if I
leave the others out.

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.800
And to use Aldo Rossi's
term, "The locus

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:34.160
is such that it
is irresolvable."

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:38.000
It's a bleak future for
both Palestine and Israel.

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:44.030
Maybe there's a solution which
doesn't include Jerusalem.

00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:48.720
This is the one which
I'm indicating here,

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:54.470
where East Jerusalem is a
suburb of another state,

00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:57.530
of a city in another
state, but that's

00:54:57.530 --> 00:55:01.570
a far-fetched resolution.

00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:04.850
There's the West
versus the East,

00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:09.500
the countries of Palestine
versus Israel, the race Arab

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:16.940
versus Hebrew, language Hebrew
versus Arabic, religion Islam

00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:23.420
and Christianity versus
Judaism, Israel's relationship

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:27.350
with the West, with
Palestine's association

00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:31.580
with the Middle East
and the Arab world,

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:36.920
Israel's preoccupation with
Western and industrial growth,

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:41.150
Palestine's developing
economy in agriculture

00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:47.300
and in technical industry,
the Jewish background

00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:54.350
of the Holocaust and the
Arab treatment of Jews

00:55:54.350 --> 00:56:02.330
in Arab countries, Palestine's
heritage of colonialism,

00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:10.360
exploitation, and so on, and
so on, and so on, and so on.

00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:14.410
You just travel the
world of imagery.

00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:15.095
It's cheaper.

00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:27.840
Jerusalem, like so many parts
of this world, [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:32.870
is exactly the same,
topological structure.

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:36.910
It's built on folded
plains causing

00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:43.750
valleys, and hillsides, and
different kinds of notions

00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:45.080
of development.

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:50.300
This is a more or less
contemporary imagery.

00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:54.280
This is the old city here.

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:59.560
This is the mosque,
Al-Aqsa mosque, and that's

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:00.610
the Dome of the Rock.

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:15.190
This is the Western Wall.

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:19.840
This is Jewish expansion
from the 19th century onward,

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.470
westward, Beit HaKarem,
and all the way

00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:34.280
to the Jewish Israeli museum,
the Jewish capital parliament

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:37.260
buildings, and
further westwards.

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:37.760
Next.

00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:49.970
Jerusalem lying on watershed
between the coastal plain

00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:57.910
on the West and the endless
desert on the right.

00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:58.410
Next.

00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:04.990
David's building of
the city on the south.

00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:09.910
The city was always
defensible on the south

00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:11.980
more easily than it
was in the north.

00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:16.150
The Romans invaded
from the north.

00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:22.000
This is a set of reconstruction
of Solomon's Temple

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.150
over the centuries.

00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.650
Next.

00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:31.990
Corbusier's sketch of
the Holy of the Holies

00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:33.415
under the nomadic tent.

00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:44.130
The whole idea of the
temple is creating

00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:49.500
an audience of people in the
community in the foreground,

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:52.315
but no penetration of
the building itself.

00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:58.695
Jesus inherits temple.

00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:12.560
He said to exonerate--
not attacked,

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:20.390
but assaulted the sellers
of goods in the foreground

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.610
of the temple.

00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:26.210
At a certain point
he says, the temple

00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:31.550
will be destroyed
after my death.

00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:38.510
He says to his associates,
from then onwards,

00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:39.860
you won't need a temple.

00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:42.960
My body will be your temple.

00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:45.350
Here, you have a
religious substitution

00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:49.505
of the image of
the body, the mass.

00:59:53.840 --> 01:00:00.170
In Catholicism, the use of
the wafer to eat something

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:05.300
refers to the actual consumption
of the symbolic consumption

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.185
of a body.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:12.350
The wine stands for blood.

01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:17.370
These primitive and
primeval relationships.

01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:17.870
Next.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.850
God is the architect.

01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:27.470
Augustine, on the
right, is seeing God,

01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:32.225
envisioning a second
city up in the sky.

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.850
For Jews, it was the second--

01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:41.240
the ethereal Jerusalem
is about 10 miles up.

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.460
For Arabs, it's
about 15 miles up.

01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:44.960
Next.

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:54.370
Reversionary construction
of these Ezekiel's temple

01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:56.695
from the six, seven chapters.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.770
I didn't go into
this, and I think

01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:04.420
we'll leave it for the moment.

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:08.920
It was the notion of
the invention of heaven.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:11.500
For the Jews, it
seemed to me that early

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:20.260
on the God with Yahweh,
heaven was above,

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:27.790
but dead human beings were
not part of the territory that

01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:30.070
should be taken account of.

01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:34.240
Priests wore gloves when
dealing with dead human beings,

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.525
like animals.

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:36.025
Next.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:43.170
Here, it's temple
reconstruction.

01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:46.380
The great battle, the
invasion, of the Romans

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:49.015
and the slaughter of the Jews.

01:01:49.015 --> 01:01:49.515
Next.

01:01:53.300 --> 01:02:00.140
The only map of Jerusalem,
this is in Jordan

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:03.650
in a place called
Madaba, near Aman.

01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:08.750
This is a mosaic floor in
a church in Madaba showing

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:13.970
the Roman construction of
The Cardo, The East-West

01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:19.440
Cardo, and the Decumanus
from the Jaffa Gate

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:24.825
running right angles.

01:02:24.825 --> 01:02:25.325
Next.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.260
This is the Ecce Homo Arch.

01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:36.960
We're looking at
a map of Jerusalem

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.950
at the time of the
death of Christ.

01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:46.310
You will see the connection
from the praetorium.

01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:49.830
So here, it's praetorium at
the top of the Temple Mount

01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:56.250
diagram along the way of the
cross, all the way to Golgotha,

01:02:56.250 --> 01:03:03.730
to the Golgotha hill, and the
putative passion of Christ.

01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:06.150
This is [INAUDIBLE],,
this way of the cross

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:09.720
is a ritualistic
celebration carried out

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:14.040
each Easter in Jerusalem
by thousands of pilgrims

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.850
from all over the world.

01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:16.350
Next.

01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:26.510
The temple of Aphrodite
prior to the establishment

01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:27.620
of the church.

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:31.400
The original establishment
of the Church of the Holy

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:36.290
Sepulcher has various
religious components,

01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:40.470
but it connects to The
Cardo on the extreme right.

01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.970
Next.

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:55.330
Here is a version of it
after the Arab presence.

01:03:55.330 --> 01:04:05.670
The entrance now is
on the south here,

01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:11.430
and its connection to The
Cardo is truncated and stopped.

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:16.630
These are various components
of the Christian story.

01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:17.130
Next.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:27.630
The Christian faiths
do not trust access

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:31.860
to the Church of
the Holy Sepulcher,

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:40.380
and for centuries have
endured the Nusaybah family,

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:45.540
an Israeli Islamic
family, with the keys.

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:51.155
Here is the entrance
to the south.

01:04:51.155 --> 01:04:51.655
Next.

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:55.275
Here's the roof.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:02.120
A Christian priest living
on the roof of the Church

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:05.330
of the Holy Sepulcher
in semi-exile, and here

01:05:05.330 --> 01:05:10.455
is an Easter night
celebration on the roof.

01:05:10.455 --> 01:05:10.955
Next.

01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:18.450
The establishment,
first establishment,

01:05:18.450 --> 01:05:22.740
of the Dome of the Rock, the
circular purple building,

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:26.760
and the Al-Aqsa
mosque on the south,

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:35.340
and the many
institutions leaving

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:41.745
this part of the holy city
to be the Jewish quarter.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.590
The Basilica of Holy Zion--

01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:51.220
slowly there's something
about the Armenian quarter

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:56.165
and the Christian quarter to
develop further to the north.

01:05:56.165 --> 01:05:56.665
Next.

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:06.540
The Dome of the Rock,
that Al-Aqsa mosque--

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:07.040
next.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:17.230
The Crusader period for
a relatively short time,

01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:22.700
the [LATIN],, the baptistery,
the Temple Salomonis,

01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:28.300
the previous Al-Aqsa mosque,
not destroyed but maintained,

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:32.830
only Christianized
in a simple way--

01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:35.080
all the Christian
institutions which

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.900
grow up under the Crusader.

01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:42.820
St. James Cathedral, the Greek
hopice, the Syrian monastery,

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:46.360
the church of St. Martin,
St. John the Baptist,

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:49.210
the Hospitaliers
quarter, the building

01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:55.940
of the largest
hospital in the world

01:06:55.940 --> 01:07:01.450
at that time in the
Muristan district,

01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:08.030
largely part of the
Christianic beneficence.

01:07:08.030 --> 01:07:08.530
Next.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:29.010
The retaking of the city under
Arab Islamic circumstances

01:07:29.010 --> 01:07:33.150
by Saladin, rebuilding
of the walls,

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:40.920
the wall's rebuilt in 1131,
1191 to 1213, all of the schools

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:45.840
and community places as a
result of the Islamicization

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:48.360
of this space.

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:54.820
1917, Jerusalem prior, at the
time of the British invasion.

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:55.320
Next.

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:05.240
I mentioned the example
of the [INAUDIBLE],,

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:13.130
the layering of David's
tomb, the Dormitian Abbey,

01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:17.779
and the [INAUDIBLE]
Caiaphas, one of the agents

01:08:17.779 --> 01:08:20.689
in the death of Jesus.

01:08:20.689 --> 01:08:25.430
But the Last Supper takes
place there as well.

01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:28.310
Here is the Dormitian
Abbey, which

01:08:28.310 --> 01:08:33.500
has these three layers of
vertical space belonging

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.830
to different religions.

01:08:34.830 --> 01:08:35.330
Next.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:48.729
The final subdivision of the
Holy City into four sectors,

01:08:48.729 --> 01:08:53.560
the Dome of the Rock,
and the Al-Aqsa mosque,

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:57.279
penetrating into the Jewish
sector with the Dung Gate.

01:08:57.279 --> 01:08:59.140
That's this gate.

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:03.490
The Golden Gate, which
is not open any longer

01:09:03.490 --> 01:09:05.950
to the Islamic
section, which has

01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:12.160
the Damascus Gate on the
north as its major entrance.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.840
The Church of the
Holy Sepulcher,

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:17.590
and the Christian sector,
and the Armenian sector here.

01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:19.720
The Jaffa Gate leads to--

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.540
is the prime-- if you
extend these lines,

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:28.210
the Jaffa Gate extends
to the Mediterranean.

01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:31.000
The Dung Gate extends
down to Egypt.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.109
The Damascus Gate
extends upwards to Syria,

01:09:35.109 --> 01:09:42.970
and this closed Golden Gate
potentially extends eastwards

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:44.750
to Iraq.

01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:45.250
Next.

01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:55.400
The contemporary
city on the left,

01:09:55.400 --> 01:10:00.800
the coexistence of
tall skyscrapers

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.695
on the west in the Jewish city.

01:10:06.425 --> 01:10:06.925
Next.

01:10:11.890 --> 01:10:15.420
The British occupation,
the McLean Plan,

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:20.740
it's not very clear,
but it's an attempt

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:27.040
to recognize the western part,
the Jewish part, and developing

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:31.060
it according to a
garden city model.

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:37.680
The Arab side is left gray for
reasons I don't understand.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:41.680
Restricted building
and open space--

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.865
extraordinary plan.

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:52.580
And the United Nations' plan,
which encloses a larger area

01:10:52.580 --> 01:11:02.940
than the municipality, and it
encloses Bethlehem [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:06.510
on the east, including Hadassah
Hospital and Hebrew University

01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:07.752
on the northeast--

01:11:11.490 --> 01:11:13.120
rejected by both sides.

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:18.120
Next.

01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:26.510
Jerusalem's rulers from 587--

01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:33.110
that's Nebuchadnezzar
and Babylon to 1967 AD--

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:41.030
showing that Jerusalem had
consequence at a distance.

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:48.890
The 1967 dividing of the
city in the east and west

01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:51.395
with a boundary between the two.

01:11:51.395 --> 01:11:51.895
Next.

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:58.280
The boundary taken over
and a map showing--

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:09.110
map by protagonists
of the Arab cause,

01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:11.660
arguing that the
Jews have always

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:19.130
tried to locate settlements in
a pattern which causes the city

01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:21.060
not to be unified.

01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:21.560
Next.

01:12:27.550 --> 01:12:30.730
Louis Kahn's-- one of the
Louis Kahn's great buildings,

01:12:30.730 --> 01:12:40.590
which he never built, and his
very interesting interpretation

01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:45.740
of the use of ruins
in a city of--

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:48.070
could you just turn on
those lights, please?

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:08.770
When you have the intersection
of religion, politics,

01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:13.480
geography, and history,
you cannot do anything.

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:19.600
It's frozen.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:23.620
I don't know of a situation
which has managed to overcome--

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:24.925
maybe Belgian.

01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:37.540
I suppose in Europe at
least the elimination

01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:42.010
of obstacles towards
the creation of a plane

01:13:42.010 --> 01:13:44.710
of general acceptance.

01:13:44.710 --> 01:13:46.930
And the European
Union is perhaps

01:13:46.930 --> 01:13:54.100
the most modern example of
the breaking down of barriers.

01:13:54.100 --> 01:14:01.510
The barriers are still
between Algiers and Paris.

01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:06.100
It's between the hinterland
of countries, Turkey

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:12.470
and the European Union, sending
migrant labor back and forth.

01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:19.330
But this is a
phenomenon which is not

01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:22.870
easily applied to Jerusalem.

01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:24.865
In the case of
Johannesburg, you will

01:14:24.865 --> 01:14:27.040
see the absence of religion.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:31.030
It is purely a question of race.

01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:35.890
Once you eliminate region
and you only deal with race,

01:14:35.890 --> 01:14:40.220
you find it easier to resolve,
even although South Africa

01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:46.330
has struggled into the
post-apartheid democracy.

01:14:46.330 --> 01:14:50.740
It took enormous resources,
and time, and bloodshed.

01:14:50.740 --> 01:15:03.960
And Johannesburg is an
artifact of race, and so on.

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:06.900
So we look at these others
in a slightly different light

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:08.310
than Jerusalem.

01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:14.130
But Jerusalem is the great
metaphysical city of the world.

01:15:14.130 --> 01:15:17.010
It's the most important
metaphysical presence.

01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:31.190
What that means, meaning-wise,
is difficult to say.

01:15:31.190 --> 01:15:35.270
They are parts where you tread
and walk softly and slowly,

01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:38.810
because you have a
history of associations

01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:42.000
with that particular place.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.090
And these associations
are carefully vivid.

01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:52.940
There have been
Palestinian riots

01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:58.320
around the archaeology
of certain regions

01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.205
in the olden city.

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:08.090
Somebody one day will try to
excavate under the Holy Mount

01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:12.590
to see if the Holies
of Holy is still there.

01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:18.800
Steven Spielberg's probably
likely to do the movie.

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:24.860
Although, he's done a
movie which is similar.

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:28.100
Anyway, any thoughts
about all of this?

01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:36.240
Complexity is an easy evasion.

01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:43.060
You know, wherever I go around
the world hearing people talk

01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:45.310
about cities, the
modern interpretation

01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:49.930
is they're too complex to
have theories about them.

01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:54.700
And no city is more
complex than Jerusalem.

01:16:54.700 --> 01:17:00.250
No city has been the site
of three major religions.

01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:09.420
No city has been the site
of 3,000 years of invasion

01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:15.710
and succession, resilience
and the building

01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:17.120
up of history and myths.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:24.870
You should go and visit it.

01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:27.330
That's all I can recommend.

01:17:27.330 --> 01:17:31.170
See if you can make
any sense of it.

01:17:31.170 --> 01:17:33.210
You've lived in
Jerusalem, haven't you?

01:17:33.210 --> 01:17:34.920
AUDIENCE: I never
lived in Jerusalem.

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.327
JULIAN BEINART: You never--

01:17:36.327 --> 01:17:38.160
AUDIENCE: I've been
there hundreds of times,

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.915
but never [INAUDIBLE]
for more than one night.

01:17:40.915 --> 01:17:41.790
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:51.980
The first immigrant
Zionists saw Jerusalem

01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:56.870
as an old-fashioned
historically-bound city.

01:17:56.870 --> 01:18:06.710
And [INAUDIBLE] chose to
make Tel Aviv the capital,

01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:10.820
or Haifa the capital
facing the Mediterranean,

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:19.390
or in the case of Ben-Gurion,
the new city of [INAUDIBLE]..

01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:23.540
It's Chaim Weizmann
who found Jerusalem

01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:30.320
to be archaic and medieval, and
the new Jewish Zionist spirit

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:41.590
was in favor of novelty
and social equity, and some

01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:46.420
of the things which it hasn't
been able to perpetuate.

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:49.450
OK, we'll do
Johannesburg on Thursday

01:18:49.450 --> 01:18:52.590
and see if there's
any comparison.
