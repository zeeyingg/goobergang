00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.150
PROFESSOR: So,
as an aside for more

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.000
advanced students,
let's try to fill

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.700
in some mathematical
details to provide a theory

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.360
to support or interpret
the Lin-Marr hypothesis

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.760
of disinfection
kinetics having to do

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.450
with the concentration
of solutes during drying

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.830
and their effect on
deactivating viruses.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.700
So, to put it in
mathematical terms,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.870
if we have a certain number
of viruses Nv in a droplet,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.140
then we'll postulate
that d Nv dt is

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.410
minus lambda v0,
the deactivation

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.680
rate per solute
virion collision,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.790
times the volume fraction
of disinfecting solutes

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.950
we'll call phi d, which
is time dependent,

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.270
having to do with the size
of the droplet, times Nv.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.450
The volume fraction
of disinfecting

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.319
solutes we'll write as alpha
D, a constant, times phi

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.430
s, which is the total volume
fraction of solutes present.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.070
And that might be, for example,
the fraction of solutes

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.060
that are sodium chloride
or some other salt that

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.950
might be causing the damage
to the virus, as opposed

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.430
to the mucins or other
macromolecules that

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.380
may be present.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.990
Then we can-- as the droplet is
shrinking with a radius R of t,

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.440
then it's simply
the volume of phi s

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.880
that is getting re-scaled
relative to the initial value,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.910
phi 0, as R0, the
initial radius,

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.259
divided by R of t cubed.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.690
So that's just simply the
changing of the volume.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.750
Now let's recall
some of our results

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.190
from the past earlier
part of this chapter

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.650
having to do with Wells'
theory of evaporation.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.570
So, if we consider
diffusion-limited droplets,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.550
we've shown that the radius
of the droplet versus time

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.860
relative to the
initial radius R0

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.070
is square root of 1
minus t over tau e, where

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.640
tau e is the evaporation
time, R0 squared divided

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.539
by d bar, a constant with
units of diffusivity, times 1

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.630
minus RH, the relative humidity.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.120
Now that predicts
pure liquid droplets

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.940
that shrink all the way to
nothing and evaporate away,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.650
but, when there's
solute present, there's

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.770
a cutoff, which we've also
discussed that gives you

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.260
an equilibrium stable
size of the drop,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.360
R equilibrium, relative to
R0, which is given by phi s0,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.730
the solid volume fraction--
or solute volume fraction

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.980
initially divided by 1 minus
RH raised to the 1/3 power.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.700
By writing that as square root
of 1 minus tau over tau e,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.210
we can also define the time tau
when you reach the equilibrium

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.250
size by a diffusion-limited
evaporation process.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.420
So that's sort of the time to
form a stable droplet nucleus.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.750
Now let's start combining
all these equations,

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.590
and we can write what is the
volume fraction of disinfecting

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.380
solutes, phi d of t.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.650
Well, from this equation
here, it'll be alpha d times

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.050
phi s of t, which
is phi s0, times

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.230
this ratio, R0 over R cubed.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.560
So, using this expression for
diffusion-limited kinetics,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:24.220
this would give me a 1 minus
t over tau e to the 3/2.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.700
And, if we look at
the ultimate limit

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.390
here that they'll get from when
it's a solute, when tau goes--

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.550
or when t goes to tau,
the evaporation time,

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.600
so when you've reached
the droplet nucleus stage,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.340
we're left with just
alpha d times 1 minus RH.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.150
So that tells us sort of the
fraction of solutes which

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.510
are present as a function
of relative humidity,

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.750
but, also, as a function of
time, as drying is going on.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.770
So now let's go back to
this dynamical equation.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.250
And let's go ahead and solve it.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.810
So this is a first-order,
separable-order differential

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:03.930
equation.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:11.090
So what we can do is write this
as minus d Nv over lambda v0.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.440
Nv is equal to phi d of t dt.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.410
So we've put all
the N's on one side

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.200
and the t's on the other side.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.110
And so we can actually then
integrate this equation.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.750
And so the integral of dN over
N is the natural log of N.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.560
So we can write this as
minus 1 over lambda v0

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.909
natural log of Nv
over Nv0, which

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.990
is the initial value of Nv.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.200
And, in time, we're integrating
from the initial time

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:51.030
0 up to the droplet nucleus
time tau of phi d of t dt.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.120
So, substituting our
expression right here,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.830
we then see that we have
alpha d phi s0 times

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:07.890
the integral from 0 to tau
dt over 1 minus t over tau e

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.650
to the 3/2.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.340
And we can do that integral
and get alpha d phi s0.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.140
And then let's see.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.580
To get the integration
variable, we

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.230
need to have a tau e here and
write that as dt over tau e.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.580
And, doing the integral,
we would get 2 times 1

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.440
over square root of 1 minus
tau over tau e minus 1,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.220
evaluating at the two
limits of integration,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.560
taking into account the
integral of the-- antiderivative

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.320
of integrand there is 1
over 1 minus t over tau e

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.490
to the 1/2 power times 2.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.290
So, putting all
this together then,

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.020
we can write the viability.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:05.140
So we can write the log
of Nv over Nv0 as minus--

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.350
we have all this stuff here--

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:13.510
2 alpha d phi s0 lambda
v0, putting the lambda

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.340
v0 back on the other
side with the minus sign.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.330
And then we have
times two factors.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.140
So, first, there's
the factor, which

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:30.620
we know has units of time,
which is R0 squared over d bar.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.180
So that's, essentially, kind
of a water vapor diffusion time

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.210
that comes into the
evaporation time, tau e.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.409
So that sets the timescale here.

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:42.080
But then what we're
really interested in

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.490
is the relative humidity effect.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.370
So that would be--

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.000
let's see here.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.520
So we have this factor,
and then we also have the--

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.020
let's see.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.980
The 1 minus RH is
coming in where?

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.110
Sorry, so, 1 over square
root of tau, this one

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.640
is from right here.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.640
That's R over R of tau.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.120
And R of tau is, by
definition, R equilibrium.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.770
So it's this factor here.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:25.010
So we get 1 minus RH over
phi s0 to the 1/3 minus 1.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:31.130
And then we also
have this factor

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:40.080
of 1 minus RH that comes,
yes, from the tau e

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.890
because the tau e has this
sort of basic timescale,

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.920
but there's also a factor of
1 minus RH that I've included.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.600
So the point of
all this theory was

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.090
to try to understand
what is the dependence

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.060
on relative humidity, which is
what I've shown here in white.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.550
And, if you plot this
function, then what you find

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.330
is a function of
relative humidity.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:12.320
Then, if you do here
log of Nv over Nv0--

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:18.640
so this is our relative
viability of the virus,

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.870
and the 0 here corresponds
to Nv0, the initial--

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.910
then, this white function,
what this looks like

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.580
is something, which
decays like this.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.500
It kind of reaches
a minimum around 80

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.960
or in this range from
sort of 60 to 80,

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.010
depending on what the values
of this parameter phi s0

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.270
is in fact.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.650
And then it goes back up again.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.650
So, basically, we get a
shape for the dependence

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.070
of the relative humanity
that nicely matches

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.690
the experimental data and is
consistent with the hypothesis

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:53.050
of disinfection kinetics that
was postulated by Lin and Marr.
