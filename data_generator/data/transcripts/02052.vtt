00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.580
PROFESSOR: So while
I've argued that there

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.040
are many ways in which
a room can become

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.110
well mixed,
hopefully well enough

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.200
to apply our well
mixed criterion

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.800
for airborne transmission
through long range aerosols,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.680
there is one very important
way in which the transmission

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.420
problem is never well mixed.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.700
And that is taking
into account the source

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.520
of the particles,
which is the exhaling

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.160
of an infected
individual which leads

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.100
to a very high concentration
of particles leaving

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.650
the mouth, which then
ends up being dispersed

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.490
throughout the room.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.310
And there is a sort of
space and time dependence

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.930
of that process which
we must consider

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.120
in looking at other
possibilities of transmission

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.150
than just the well
mixed background air.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.680
So in particular,
I've already indicated

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.260
that the flows
generated by breathing

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.420
tend to be at higher
enough Reynolds number

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.860
to generate turbulence.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.430
And in particular, they generate
a turbulent jet which ends up

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.090
taking the form of a cone.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.620
Not perfectly but
approximately a cone,

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.130
which means that the
radius of the jet

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.720
is alpha times the
position of the jet here.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.250
So if I write a
coordinate system,

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.789
a cylindrical
coordinate system where

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.000
z is the direction of the flow
and r is the radial coordinate,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.320
then that's the cone and
the cone angle is alpha.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.990
The term alpha also has
a physical interpretation

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.660
as the air entrainment
coefficient.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.160
And for respiratory
jets in the air,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.320
this coefficient is
usually around 0.1 to 0.15.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.820
So that gives you basically
the opening angle of the cone.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.520
So I will come to
explaining and deriving

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.750
why the jet has the
shape of a cone.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.460
But let's just assume that.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.440
And let's continue
with the assumption

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.290
that the flow is at high
Reynolds number which

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.320
means it's dominated by
inertia, by kinetic energy,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.300
and by the tendency
for the fluid

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.760
to keep wanting to move
in a new direction.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.620
Now if the fluid
coming out of the mouth

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.500
were just being spit
out at a very high rate,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.380
you might imagine a very
narrow kind of stream of air.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.740
But the reason it's widening
is that air is actually

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.840
being entrained, is that
some of the ambient air

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.070
is being sucked in.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.510
And this is making the jet
have more and more fluid in it.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.660
But then that fluid is
sharing the momentum.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.270
It's also spreading and
diffusing the particles.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.370
And the wider it
gets, the more it

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.500
slows down because
now that momentum

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.640
is being shared through the sort
of turbulent exchange going on.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.430
So let's do that calculation.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.000
So we have-- so just
remind you that we

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.230
are in a situation of very
high Reynolds number typically.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.860
And we will assume
that there is roughly--

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.630
and it's actually
a good assumption--

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.300
roughly a constant
momentum flux.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.060
What that means if
I take a slice here

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.430
and I look at, essentially,
the kinetic energy

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.200
density or the
momentum per time that

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.010
is crossing a slice of the
jet, that that actually

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.810
should be conserved.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.470
And so if I write that
momentum flux as capital K

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.780
is the area of the
cross section pi

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.280
r^2, if I look at
a given position r here.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.930
And then I have the
momentum is the density

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.770
of the fluid, which
is the air, times

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.770
the velocity field,
the velocity.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.060
And so that's momentum.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.060
Momentum flux would be
momentum times velocity or rho

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.880
v^2, which is also
kinetic energy density.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.050
This quantity should
be roughly constant.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.070
So we can now solve for
the average velocity,

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:37.650
v bar, which would be square
root of K over pi rho_a times

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.200
1/r, after we
take the square root,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.930
but then because
we have a cone r

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.710
is alpha z So this
is square root of K

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.060
over pi a 1 over alpha z.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.630
So we can see the velocity is
decaying like 1 over distance

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.710
from the mouth.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.540
So the jet is slowing down.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.110
But it's still, of course,
continued to advance

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.860
as the momentum is being shared
across a larger and larger area

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.300
of entrained, turbulent flow.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.070
So we can now use this
result to figure out

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.290
what is the rate of
progress of the front.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.350
So if I call this
z of the front,

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.190
so let's say when I
first start exhaling

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.630
it is kind of a wall
of droplets and I

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.220
can sketch that this flow
is actually full of droplets

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.060
that we're interested
in tracking,

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.330
I'd like to know how those
are first leaving the mouth.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.580
Well, I can write
that this velocity is,

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.310
at a given position
corresponding to the front,

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.350
is dzf dt.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.450
And if this is the f, so
I apply this at the front,

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:54.770
then I can put the zf on the
other side and I have zf dzf dt

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:02.570
is equal to square root
of K over pi rho_a.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.790
Then I've got, I guess also,
an alpha or 1 over alpha.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.890
And then this
expression here can

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:16.380
be written as 1/2 times the
derivative of zf squared.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.980
So I can then solve for the
position of the front and I

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.670
find zf is equal to--

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.250
well, let's see what I get.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.520
I put the 2 on the other side.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.690
I take a square root.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:33.080
So I get 2 over alpha to the
1/2, I get K over pi rho_a

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.980
was a square root.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.420
And then I take another
square root so I get a 1/4.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.470
And then I get t to the 1/2.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.730
Because when I
integrate this equation,

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:49.970
I get zf squared is all this
stuff times t, starting from t

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:50.750
equals 0.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.980
So we find is that, initially,
the jet starts to progress

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.280
like square root of time.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.610
And so this coefficient
here is some kind of--

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.520
has the units of a diffusivity.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.820
So it kind of like appears that
the jet is sort of diffusing.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.730
You could call this
D_effective,

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.630
sort of for the
front of the jet.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.430
But that doesn't last
forever because some

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.410
point the person
closes their mouth

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.520
and starts breathing in again,
and maybe pulls the fluid

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.960
back a little bit.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.800
But not too much.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.240
Because it has momentum and
it keeps moving forward.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.090
So when somebody breathes, it
starts out looking like that.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:36.370
But then at a later time if I
draw this same person again,

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.409
then--

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:40.870
in fact, actually, let me
draw him with a closed mouth.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.230
Because he's just
finished, let's say,

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.460
exhaling is getting ready
for his next breath.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.380
So now this blob of fluid has
kind of worked its way out

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.690
and it's now somewhere out here.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.050
And this is what we call a puff.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.210
So if you're smoking,
for example, a cigarette

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.840
you know that you can
create a puff of smoke

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.850
by just releasing a
finite amount of fluid.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.300
And then it kind
of goes out and it

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.720
makes some interesting
patterns and usually

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.970
is very turbulent unless
you're very careful in trying

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.910
to control it.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:21.120
And of course this contains
lots of these droplets

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.840
that we're interested in.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.330
And so then now we
can briefly ask,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.070
how fast does the puff move.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.770
Well, you see here,
the fluid keeps

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.330
moving because it's constantly
being given momentum.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.390
So if it's a steady jet
as you're breathing,

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.480
you're pushing, pushing,
pushing and so this thing

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.870
keeps moving on the square root
of t, it keeps entraining more.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.940
But as soon as you stop
giving it more momentum,

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.150
you give it just a finite
amount of momentum,

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.270
then the puff
actually slows down.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:47.980
It doesn't keep pushing
ahead as quickly.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.840
It also doesn't entrain
more air as quickly either.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.610
And we can do a
very simple argument

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.960
to see what happens
to the scaling.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.460
So this momentum flux here
was a constant momentum flux

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.930
in the case of a jet.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.710
But here in the
case of a puff, we

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.690
could, maybe as a
very crude estimate,

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:12.240
just say that the momentum
flux is something now replaced

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.080
by some kind of constant
value that is maintained only

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.680
for a time, tb, which is
the time of the breath,

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.920
and then averaged over
a longer period times.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:28.050
If you think of this as kind of
like an average momentum flux,

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.640
we've injected some momentum
flux but then we took it away.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.310
And so if I want to find out the
average over a period of time t

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.050
I have to divide by t.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:40.500
So you see if I do that then,
I arrive that in the puff case

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.130
that the position of
the front or the puff

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.440
is a lot of these
same constants here,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:53.850
but is now scaling as t to the
1/4 because my K has a 1 over t

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.650
and it's raised to 1/4
power, then I end up

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.100
with zf goes like t to 1/4.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.220
So it slows down.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.390
So first it was sort
of square root of time.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.000
Now it's become more
[INAUDIBLE] time.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.130
And it's almost just
sort of sitting there,

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.430
it's not progressing that much.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:07.860
And then a new breath comes.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.830
And so that's what happens next.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:15.330
And especially if one
is speaking or singing,

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.570
then the exhaling is a much
longer and more continuous

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.570
process than the inhaling
which is very sudden.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.690
So you talk and take a
breath, and you talk.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.530
And so there's a lot more of
this going on than this, even

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.070
in normal speech and in normal
breathing to some extent

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.740
as well, but especially
when one is speaking.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.080
And so an interesting
development

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:44.650
then is that if we have a
person who is speaking, then

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:49.570
we can generate what has
been called a puff train.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:53.860
So we have here is the most
recent new breath getting

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:59.140
exhaled and then the
previous one was here, still

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.850
kind of floating around
and the one ahead

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.380
of that is dispersed a bit more.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.910
But it hasn't progressed as far.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.770
And so it's a
little bit thinner.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:09.070
And if we kind of color
each breath a different way,

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.950
then what we're left
with is something

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:17.680
that actually looks an awful lot
like a continuous cone again.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.370
So this is a puff train.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:27.120
This could be, for example,
from speaking or singing.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.950
And overall, the behavior
is quite similar to a jet

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.870
just where the K is replaced by
the time average momentum flux.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.320
So I should mention that
this way of thinking here

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.290
was recently introduced
and verified experimentally

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:55.020
in a paper by Abkarian and
Howard Stone and collaborators,

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.910
and also introduced this
notion of the scaling

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.570
and showed that actually the
puff train has a scaling which

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.310
is very similar
to the initial jet

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.460
with the square root of time.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.420
And so that's an important
concept come to now.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.250
Because we want to ask
now, what if somebody

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.610
is speaking or even just
breathing continuously

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.280
in a certain direction and
generating aerosol particles,

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.100
how does their concentration
evolve in this sort

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.440
of a respiratory plume or jet.
