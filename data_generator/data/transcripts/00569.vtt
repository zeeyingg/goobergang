00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
JULIAN BEINART: I'm going to
go through a number of cases

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.400
with you today.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:40.400
So we'll have to rely on,
sometimes, on this hand

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.890
out, sometimes on the slides.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.680
Let me first tell you
what handout contains.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:56.230
The first is an example
from Philippe Boudon's book,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.500
Lived-in Architecture.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.490
This is his housing for
steel workers at Pessac,

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:12.720
near Bordeaux, which Boudon
studied after a period of time

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.280
and made these
drawings of the changes

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.380
that people have made to
the original plan, which

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.370
is the top left.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.660
The elevations indicate
a couple of things,

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.925
because I'm not going to go into
any detail about this example.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:46.470
People enclosed the open porch
of Corbusier's to make garages.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.940
They replaced long,
linear windows

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.360
by rectangular windows of
a much more oblong nature,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.080
arguing that Corbusier's
windows were not modern enough

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.590
and so on and so on.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.140
When Corbusier was asked by
Boudon about these changes,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:19.050
he said, to be grammatically
as possible, life

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.610
is more important than art.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.200
There was no indication that
he expected or made provisions

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.140
for changes to take place.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.740
He was central to
modernism, that time

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.870
was captured within the
space of the project.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.480
He neither looked forward to
changes that could be made

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.350
nor did he look back to
the possibility of history

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.890
or memory affecting your work.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.280
So one ism, as I tried
to indicate on Tuesday,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.350
was the notion of
fixed culture, which

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.520
operated with the production of
objects which had no reference

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.820
backwards of any value.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.230
Corbusier is a classic
example of a man who

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:36.730
denies the 19th century street
forever and then proceeded

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.900
to make projects like this
one, in which the steel

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.880
workers themselves find
the capacity to change

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.630
without the change
being premeditated.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.020
We're going to be looking today
at the issue of looking forward

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.730
and what unpredictability means.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.480
I will use the case of MIT
on the second and third page.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:28.360
You will see the plan of MIT
from 1920, 1916, to 1994, 2004.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.390
I will discuss
[? Maria Zepharado's ?] thesis

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.410
and what she found.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.820
Next

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:51.300
Two pages from Rodrigo Perez
de Arce's work, arguing that--

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.790
it says, demanding adding
on to existing buildings

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.656
is an opportunity
for good change.

00:05:00.656 --> 00:05:02.870
AUDIENCE: Who is this?

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.570
It's not at the top.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.544
JULIAN BEINART: Isn't it?

00:05:07.544 --> 00:05:11.210
AUDIENCE: Rodrigo Perez de Arce.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:19.470
JULIAN BEINART: Rodrigo
Perez de Arce, A-R-C-E.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.530
He's from Colombia.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.777
Do you know him?

00:05:22.777 --> 00:05:24.268
AUDIENCE: No, professor.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:36.240
JULIAN BEINART: He's
a quiet man, who

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.570
draws very beautiful drawings.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:46.410
His urban-- in the larger
reading list for this class,

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.340
you'll find the reference.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.810
It's published in
Architectural Design

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.330
and also in a little handbook
by the Architectural Association

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.830
in London.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.120
I will show some
examples of his work.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.230
The next two pages are drawings
by Louis Kahn and Alison

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.250
and Peter Smithson of the Team
10 group dealing with flows.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:30.780
The next few pages are plans of
European universities from 1961

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:40.710
onward all the way through to
the Free University of Berlin

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:46.410
in 1963, all slowly dealing
with the architecture of change.

00:06:50.345 --> 00:06:50.845
OK.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:16.090
Reaction after
the end of CIM was

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.760
in the hands of a small
group of architects

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:25.840
called Team 10, who put forward
the possibility that time

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.590
could be escaped from.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:30.820
That's my words.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.780
They didn't write it.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.190
Alison and Peter Smithson,
Team 10 primaries,

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:43.930
the doctrine of their
work and theories,

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:52.110
they were interested in
notions of unpredictability,

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.560
circumstance, probability.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:04.160
They were interested in
the notion of the temporary

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.190
and the ephemeral
versus the permanent.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.280
Secondly, they were
interested in the flow,

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:25.390
in the idea that movement
systems, particularly

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.780
those that create
interaction and connection

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.309
were fundamental to their work.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:44.020
And thirdly, they tried to
argue for social reality, which

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:50.080
involved the
complexity of occasion,

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:56.060
as it occurred in most
situations at the time.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.830
They invented words,
like most architects do.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:04.750
Socioplastics is
their invention.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:09.160
Socioplastics use
that word which

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.260
embraces what the painters like
Richard Hamilton and Eduardo

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:19.060
Paolozzi were trying to
do in their painting.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.400
It's interesting
how few architects

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.520
of the modern movement or
the post-modern movement

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.850
have had much association
with painting.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.130
Frank Gehry is,
perhaps, the only one.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:36.100
Steven Holl, to some extent,
connect the interpretation

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:42.880
of architecture in light to
certain ideas about painting,

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:48.620
whereas the Modernists were
very much in the mood of all

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:54.220
the painting revolutions,
which occurred largely

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.315
in Paris and in Europe.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:12.600
So we have the notion of
change, the notion of flow,

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:18.450
and the notion of socioplastics
as central to Team 10's work.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.910
We will look a little
bit at Team 10's work.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.630
But I haven't got the
time in this class

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:29.370
to deliberate fully on Team
10 and their architecture

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.885
and their urbanistic work.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.045
We have to accept that you
cannot predict the future.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.760
There's a book by Paul
Ormerod, an Englishman,

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.710
called Why Most Things
Fail, which sets out

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:57.890
that we maintain to achieve
a particular outcome

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.100
but the complexity of the
world, even in apparently

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.400
simple situations,
appears to be so great

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.220
that it's not within our
power to ordain the future.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:17.660
He gives the example of the
world's 100 largest companies

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.220
in the period from 1912 to 1995.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:27.140
Out of the 100 largest
industrial companies in 1912,

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.420
how many have survived in 1995?

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:30.920
Guess.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.750
AUDIENCE: There's
a good book called

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.970
The Living Company, written
by Arie de Geus in which they

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:45.660
studied companies over 200
years old to understand what

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.080
would make them last over time.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.260
JULIAN BEINART: Well,
48% of the companies

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:58.410
which were in the world's
largest 100 disappeared.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.140
52% survived.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:07.570
So that means over 80 years, you
have a 50% chance of survival.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.940
It's more than human beings.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.430
JULIAN BEINART:
It's pretty good.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:21.050
He refers to the difference
between risk and uncertainty,

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:28.040
risk being where the options
are within a span of certainty,

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.080
such as flipping a coin.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:36.020
And uncertainty is where the
options are very unclear,

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.680
such as a man or a couple
of men from the moon

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.980
landing on the Earth, which
some people believe in.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.320
The difference between
risk and uncertainty

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.160
isn't easily discussed
in the work of the people

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:58.835
that I'm going to be arguing
for, this notion somehow that--

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.690
how much do you
know of this work?

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.965
Who knows about the Free
University in Berlin?

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.610
One person.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:20.610
You all are very ignorant,
if I might say so.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.280
We don't teach history properly.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.900
We don't teach urban
history at all.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.120
I have complained about
this for most of my career.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.940
And seeing this is the last
time I have to complain--

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:44.440
--I'll complain
finally, for the record.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:47.980
All right.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.680
We'll talk about the Free
University in Berlin project

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.655
by shared records.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:14:00.640
Let's just list, if we can,
some of the conventional methods

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.720
of achieving
flexibility in cities.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:12.890
Number one, land banking,
you can endow land

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:18.730
with cheap uses, farming,
parking lots, and so on,

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:23.390
on the grounds that, in future
when land becomes more scarce,

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:29.060
they will be able to be reused
without much demolition.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:33.530
Farming is not an option which
has been used in urbanism very

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:37.270
much if at all.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:43.300
Farming in New York is on
terraces and high 100-feet

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.790
above the ground, or 1,000
feet above the ground.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:56.070
Secondly, easements--
easements are

00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:07.890
rights of way which can be
endowed with limited use,

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:11.880
such as on the
sides of highways.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.950
When we spoke
about Robert Moses,

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:21.150
I spoke about the lack of
his provision of easements

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.250
on his freeways.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:27.180
The cost of providing
the easement

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:32.880
would have allowed the addition
of public transportation

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.990
next to these roads at
a cost, which is now

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.450
estimated to be a
fraction of what it now

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.000
would cost to do them.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:52.780
So you allow the possibility
of an event taking place

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:57.670
on land which is easily
available and costs very little

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:01.255
initially, but increases
in value as time passes.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.590
The problem with
prediction is that there's

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.440
a difference between
the right prediction

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.930
and the excessive prediction.

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:19.250
Now, it's between too little
response and too much response.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:29.020
Prediction costs money
under most circumstances.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:33.010
You can also do
excessive prediction.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.430
I think I showed you a diagram
of a South African mining

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:40.420
town, a classic case
where the town was

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:45.820
designed so that the central
businesses could expand.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.240
The expansion area around
the center of the city

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:54.700
was so poorly treated, so badly
landscaped, not landscaped

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:55.860
at all.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.150
It was just dirt.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.460
It, in fact, caused the
center business area

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:07.630
not only to grow, but to decline
in size instead of to expand.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:14.260
Leaving land for expansion
is one of the ideas

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.240
that we'll look at a
bit more carefully.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:28.650
You can leave open
space for consumption,

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:33.360
assuming a coarse
grain in your town.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:39.730
I will show you the example of
the Seoul the Olympics in 1988,

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:45.270
which built its Olympic Games
on the basis of a fairly

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.850
large open space system.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:53.100
Who knows the 1988
Olympic Games?

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.240
Were you there?

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.250
AUDIENCE: Not at the
Games, I know the site.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.667
JULIAN BEINART:
You know the site.

00:17:57.667 --> 00:17:58.620
Yeah.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.820
Yeah.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:06.660
It's a classic example of the
cannibalization of easy access

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.830
space.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.880
Open space is easy access.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.200
It's cheap-- not cheap
in the public's mind,

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:18.030
but cheap in the
promoter's mind.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.750
And most of the facilities,
including the Olympic Village

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:26.430
by Kyu Sung Woo, who
lives here in Cambridge,

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.310
was built on this
available land.

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.600
We'll come to
Seoul '88 later on.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.500
I'm just running
through some of these.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:45.390
There's infrastructure
for flexibility.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.200
When we designed the MIT
Brain and Cognitive Sciences

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.280
building, we had to allow
for the C86 railroad

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.030
to run through underneath
the building that

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:01.710
made an extraordinary difference
in the kind of building

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:03.690
which you could design

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:11.100
but we calculated that if
the air Rights Committee

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:15.030
owned the air right
over the C86 railroad,

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:19.020
about 22 feet or 15 meters.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.010
I'm not sure which.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.340
I think it's 22 feet.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:27.330
MIT can build 22 feet above
the plane of the railroad.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.735
We calculated when
working on this that,

00:19:29.735 --> 00:19:36.630
if MIT exercised this option and
built on the maximum air rights

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:37.500
that the--

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.950
well, they have the air rights.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.880
The degree to which they
can build vertically

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.680
will have to be
sanctioned by the city.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.400
But we calculated
that, if MIT wished

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:57.570
to expand its campus
vertically over the air rights,

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:01.980
the development would be
worth billions of dollars

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.985
in Cambridge in terms
of square footage.

00:20:05.985 --> 00:20:11.220
So imagine the possibility of
a future in which MIT could

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.210
build above a railway line.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.850
The fact is that we
only built to the height

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.450
that Cambridge allows in
our building, which was

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:28.190
large enough for our program.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:37.770
But this friction caused
by a movement system.

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.320
Corbusier's
proposition of building

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:46.320
under the freeways in Algiers
is not feasible anymore.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.470
The noise and pollution
caused by the automobiles

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:53.160
would make it
virtually impossible

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.700
to build under the freeways.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:02.040
One of the dramatic futures
in the next 50 years

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.010
is going to be to how
to capture the space

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.820
under elevated freeways
all over the world.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:15.120
They're elevated to
a considerable height

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.920
because you have to be
able to pass through

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:22.500
with a truck, which means
that you have to have ramps

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.920
at 1 in 10 or 1 in 5.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.050
Depending on how
steep you are, you

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:31.540
can take a large
amount of space.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:38.430
So I haven't seen a
proposition in recent times

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:42.420
anywhere in the world
for capturing the space

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:48.340
under a freeway in
a positive sense.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.740
We have one SMR
student project thesis,

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.680
which you'll see in
three weeks time,

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.210
which tries to do this in
Boston with great difficulty.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:08.680
But the air rights mean
that the development

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.410
above a plane,
which for the moment

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:15.370
is used by a railroad or
freeway, and the development

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:22.770
below that plane even
penetrating into the ground

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.770
are options which
utopianists have examined

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:30.370
and wondered about.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:32.155
So we have to include
them on our list.

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.910
Lastly, is the
question of geometry.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.550
And most of the
rest of my talk is

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:47.320
going to deal with people who
have used the idea of geometry

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.855
to allow for future change.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.340
OK.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:01.605
One of the people who argued
for the impact of geometry

00:23:01.605 --> 00:23:03.785
is [? Maria Zepharado's ?]
thesis.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:11.280
Maria was in this class
and became interested

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.160
in the idea of change.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:21.660
She wanted to study a city
and make some speculation

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:27.075
about how urban
transformation took place.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:39.700
She decided after being
forced to limit her thesis

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.365
to take a MIT.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.930
MIT, Shadrach Woods, the
architect of the firm, Josic--

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:58.220
oh, I forget the name
of the French firm,

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:03.380
was an American architect
who developed the word ground

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.760
scraper as a model
of MIT and used

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:11.445
as the basis for the design
of the Free University campus

00:24:11.445 --> 00:24:11.945
in Berlin.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:22.650
Maria worked with the
drawings in the MIT archives,

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.920
which had never been
looked at before,

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.590
and made an assessment
of the number

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:33.330
of geometric configurations
that allowed the campus

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:36.750
to grow in the way that it did.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:40.515
I haven't got time to go
into this detail, as always.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.970
Why are we so short of time?

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.830
Is it because we
try to do too much?

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.675
But if you don't do too much,
who says what is enough?

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.700
Should one take one
project like this

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:07.920
and spend a semester
studying it in detail?

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.310
Would you gain more
from doing that

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:15.180
versus attending a class which
tries to cover everything

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.305
in the world?

00:25:16.305 --> 00:25:17.275
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:23.100
Well, you made your choice.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:33.810
Among our findings,
six stand out,

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:39.030
the existence of an
underlying circulation system.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:46.590
MIT has a block size
of 65 feet in width

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:49.380
in the central corridor
most of the time.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.310
There are three
kinds of stems used.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.760
Number three, the quality
of the knuckles-- whenever

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.890
a building changed directions.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:06.500
Almost always when
there's an opportunity

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:11.090
to change direction, the
vertical circulation system

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:21.610
of elevators and staircases
are contained in the knuckle.

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:23.920
So she shows that
every time a building

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.330
changes direction
it is free of having

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:33.700
to replace the vertical
circulation system.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.100
It means that the
circulation system

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.400
becomes more intense as it
is joined to other systems.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.160
The fully equipped
unit section--

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:51.610
from the [INAUDIBLE] system.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:55.550
The courtyard is future space.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:27:01.030
I never realized that MIT
intended the courtyard system

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:04.480
as an opportunity for
building expansion.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.790
Thank god they haven't.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:15.220
The facades-- where facades
were considered to be permanent,

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.890
they were built of
granite or limestone.

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:22.150
Where the facades were
considered to be temporary,

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.760
they were built of brick,
yellow brick facade.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:35.500
So she argues very
systematically with a lot

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:44.560
of data that there was a
kind of DNA in the system not

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:48.970
a very profound DNA, but
a very simple DNA, which

00:27:48.970 --> 00:28:00.230
allowed MIT to grow until
2004 on its own land.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:03.350
Our building, the Brain
and Cognitive Center,

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:06.330
is on the other side
of Vassar Street.

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:10.490
It was the first
time a building--

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:14.240
not the first time, but
one of the first times

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:19.460
the major building was built
outside of the limited campus.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:27.470
We proposed an aerial connection
from building whatever-it-is

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:34.860
across Vassar Street to a
place on the second floor

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.100
of the Brain and
Cognitive Center.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.070
MIT wouldn't build it.

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:42.590
We tried very hard
to get it built.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:46.160
In fact, the German
engineer [? George Sly ?]

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:52.130
who worked on the
Freedom Tower in New York

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:56.287
is probably the best structural
engineer in the world, designed

00:28:56.287 --> 00:28:56.870
the connector.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:00.800
But MIT didn't.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.870
MIT now faces an
expansion possibility

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:09.470
which is not as simple as
expanding on your own land.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.860
It has to deal with urban
infrastructure of much more

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:13.730
complex nature.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:24.610
Another use of geometry,
which we mentioned before

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:31.140
is in the Llewelyn-Davies plan
for Milton Keynes in London one

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:36.250
of the Mark 3 New Towns.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:40.610
You'll remember that
the grid is used.

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:44.830
And the grid is spaced at
1 kilometer by 1 kilometer,

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:51.670
not 1 mile by 1 mile,
so that the consequence

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:57.730
of the generation of volume
within this enclosed grid space

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:00.670
would not be too
large and require

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.266
great separated interaction.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.520
Some other ideas--
the whole premise

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:16.980
of Milton Keynes' his plan
he summarized as follows.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.440
"The central aim of
the plan is to arrange

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.640
the necessary fixed
elements, transport drainage

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.000
water supply in
a new city, so as

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.705
to allow the greatest possible
scope for freedom and change.

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.180
It has been planned
as far as possible

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.510
to allow wide varieties
in patterns of life

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:47.400
and the greatest possible
choice for the future."

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.780
There are two things in
the geometry of the--

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:56.790
well, in the application
of the geometry.

00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:00.540
Number one is the
idea, as I drew

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.480
on the blackboard, of
recognizing the possibility

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.820
of a space frame system.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.790
A space frame system
in architecture

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:14.400
is a system which spans distance
and allows you to put points

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.870
on the load system at
any point as opposed

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:22.740
to point and beam system,
where you can only

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:29.320
load the system where there is
a column beneath your point.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:33.960
So it's kind of pointless
system or freedom of pointing,

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:38.010
which allows almost any
kind of change to exist.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:42.150
The notion of deciding what
the maximum amount that you

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:48.210
can allow before the system
cripples itself is interesting.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:54.840
You have to use mathematical
prediction systems

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.000
like the Poisson distribution.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.490
Who knows what the
Poisson distribution is?

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:03.120
You should know.

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:07.520
If you're going to
design a university

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:11.600
campus or a
schoolroom, how do you

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:17.000
decide on the distribution
of the sizes of classrooms?

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:22.520
You're architects.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.910
You're in advanced
standing at MIT.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:27.230
You're doing doctorates.

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:30.450
You're doing all kinds
of advanced degrees.

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.630
And if I ask you the
simple proposition

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:34.640
that, if you had
to walk out of here

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:39.440
and you were in Burma
somewhere and they decided

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:45.410
to build a new university, how
would you decide on its program

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:47.620
without knowing the
Poisson distribution?

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.630
The Department of Mathematics
at Cambridge University,

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:56.660
a new building, is
designed on the basis

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.780
of Poisson distribution.

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.480
It allocates
probability of sizes

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.720
given certain average rates.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.390
I'm not trying to be clever.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:11.960
I'm just trying
to say that there

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:16.850
are statistical measures
which give one a better

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:18.455
prediction about the future.

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:24.540
One of the best subjects I
ever studied in graduate school

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:25.800
was statistics.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:31.350
I hated it, but it made me
aware of the fact that you

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:34.200
can generate knowledge
through sampling

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.930
systems of great capacity.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:42.990
I was staggered when
my professor said,

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:46.080
the only reason we
have live matches

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:52.290
is because we know statistically
how many matches fail.

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:56.310
And we can predict the
production of boxes of matches

00:33:56.310 --> 00:34:02.460
without any of them
failing or 99% succeeding--

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:08.010
staggering, but a
simple observation.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:14.170
The Poisson distribution is
one of the features of a--

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:21.020
so the second feature
Milton Keynes,

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:26.000
in trying to predict
the possibility of,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.290
first of all, diversity
and, secondly, of change

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:34.010
is to introduce
zoning systems based

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:35.719
on performance dimensions.

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:42.679
The reason why German
zoning started out

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:44.929
was because of the
industrial city

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:49.880
causing noise and dirt and
fumes and traffic as opposed

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:54.889
to the quiet notions that are
required in a residential area.

00:34:54.889 --> 00:35:00.560
If today a high tech
company produces

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:06.080
no noise, no smoke,
no sound, can it not

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.540
be adjacent to a
residential building?

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:19.990
Of course, I don't know how this
has worked in Milton Keynes.

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:24.160
If I buy a piece of land and
I make a wonderful garden

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.520
next to it, it has value.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:32.230
If the city decides to
build a factory next to it,

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.050
I lose value.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:37.810
How do you account
for that change?

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:40.450
Do you repay me?

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:44.020
I take you to court
and say I have rights.

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:49.150
They say, you don't have rights
to predict, to confiscate,

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:55.370
the rights of development
and so around you.

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:56.770
It's a fundamental problem.

00:35:56.770 --> 00:36:00.700
If you wish to
design for diversity,

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:05.050
you can, of course, write a rule
saying that a factory will not

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:08.500
be within 100 feet.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:13.180
But performance dimensions
measure sound, noise,

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.850
frequency of traffic.

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:20.260
If trucks start working, as they
do in New York, at 5 o'clock

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:23.690
in the morning and
I want to sleep,

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:27.940
what right do I have to stop
the trucks from off-loading

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:29.390
at 5 o'clock in the morning?

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.240
These are tough questions.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:40.390
And flexibility simply runs up
against some of these questions

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:43.260
in a very real sense.

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:44.980
It will be
interesting to check--

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:48.730
I need to talk to
John de Monchaux who

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:51.460
is one of the designers
of Milton Keynes,

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:53.065
about how this has been handled.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:02.680
Rodrigo Pérez de Arce, who
argues in favor of keeping

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:07.670
existing stock and building
an architecture of addition,

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:11.590
he says, urbanistically,
it has three advantages.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:21.670
"By being a gradual organized
incorporation of parity

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:25.420
into an existing core,
it implies the use

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.730
of a pre-existing structure.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:29.950
And by doing so, it
extends the likelihood

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:32.285
that it's being useful
for a long time.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:42.100
Secondly, it allows for a form
of development characterized

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:46.660
by its low cost in both
social and material terms."

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.910
I'm not sure that he's right.

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:55.430
Maybe it's true in Colombia, but
the cost of renewing buildings,

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:58.700
such as the buildings
around here,

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:03.100
which have been renewed for
high technology purposes,

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.340
is extensive.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:11.710
It's not automatic that, if you
extend a building, all you do

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:17.020
is put a bedroom, an
addition to a house.

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:27.730
And thirdly, he says
that this process,

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:32.890
"this additive transformation
ensures a sense of continuity

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:36.100
in the construction of
the town and a sense

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.020
of place in both historical
and spatial terms."

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:44.080
He goes on and on.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:48.960
This is the piece from
Architectural Design

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.650
if you can't find the
AA, the little book.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.480
Let's look.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:03.260
And I need you to look
at your transcript.

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:09.740
Let's look at the development
of a systematic campus

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:12.365
plan starting in--

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:18.040
the British were
very intelligent

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:24.370
after they won the
war, the '39, '45 war.

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.770
They decided under
the Labor government,

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:31.720
which replaced Churchill--

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:35.230
Churchill was interestingly
successful as a war leader,

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:39.895
but helpless as a peace leader.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:44.560
Maggie Thatcher was
equally hopeless.

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:52.620
She was a big war success
with the Falkland Islands,

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:53.550
big victory indeed.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.110
Yeah.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:02.460
Anyway, we start
with the 1961 plan

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.190
for the University of Sussex.

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:10.560
This is post-war,
post '45, rebuilding

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:13.800
of educational
institutions in Europe.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:21.200
And I use this data just to make
an argument about the change.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.620
61 Sussex is a campus plan.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:26.900
They are separate schools.

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:32.060
They are individual categories,
individual enterprises,

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:38.040
School of Mathematics, School
of Humanities, and so on.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:42.480
By the University of
Lancaster in 1964,

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:48.290
the tension starts being paid
to the connecting of places.

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:52.880
And the system is one in
which modular space is

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.915
connected in a complex network.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:07.230
Number four, the University of
East Anglia in 1961, the plan

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:12.210
is now a solid
linear configuration

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:16.680
with three small outgrowths.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.840
But the whole
system is very much

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.585
based on the linearity of--

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:29.180
number five, the University
of Essex in 1961,

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:35.480
tries to take that linearity
and bend it up and down.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:38.240
By now, people are
asking questions

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:43.400
of whether interdisciplinary
knowledge systems are not

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:52.530
taking hold, biology and science
or physics and chemistry.

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:59.190
So the breakdown of
conventional disciplines

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:06.540
suggests the kind of grouping of
and even a future in which this

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:13.950
might continue, allowing for
a switch to the next page,

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:17.400
University of Surrey,
where you start

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:23.884
getting some inclination of the
idea of building modular space

00:42:23.884 --> 00:42:27.180
of various dimensions.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:32.760
University of Dublin,
[? John Carver's ?] project

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:37.110
starts trying to articulate
the linearity by having

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:43.920
a central public spine, much
like the main corridor at MIT,

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:49.350
and outgrowths from it
depending on the need

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:56.100
to be close to the
public versus space which

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.965
requires research privacy.

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:09.230
We go down to the University
of Loughborough in 1965,

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:13.930
which is a major,
major departure.

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:19.750
Now, a 50 by 50
cube by 15 feet high

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:22.180
is the only element
to be designed

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:29.440
in the university space it will
account for 70% of the campus.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.540
What does this imply?

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:39.840
It implies that we maximize
the possibility of change

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:44.550
every space is endowed
with a service structure.

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:52.400
So that my office can become a
space for a research scientist

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:56.900
who needs specialized
heating, specialized air,

00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:02.390
specialized steam,
specialized power.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:07.230
If I produce all of
this for everybody,

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:12.400
we can change with
maximum flexibility.

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:19.490
Do you understand the idea?

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:26.570
This is the ultimate measure
of flexibility, an item which

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:32.070
has infinite flexibility.

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.210
In a competition for the
university, new university

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:37.790
of Bremen, one of
the competitors

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:41.360
had a railway line right
through the middle of the campus

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.540
with the train
with a crane on it.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:50.760
And it kept on moving the parts,
modules, all over the place.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:56.780
So if my department
grew, some modules

00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:00.570
could be added to the top
of our existing department.

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:05.120
If we fired half of the
Department of Architecture,

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.610
the modules could be replaced.

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:12.590
If you speed that
up, you can imagine

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:16.580
coming to your office on
Monday and needing an algorithm

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:21.290
to explain where you should be
or where you're going to be.

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:29.250
MIT's central corridor, despite
the changes, has remained.

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:34.830
And it has a low rate of change.

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:38.430
It should have changed
much more than it has,

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:41.850
but it's become embedded
into the system,

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:45.060
so that whilst almost every
other space at MIT has

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:48.480
undergone change, it hasn't.

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:53.250
It has the same old
dull administrative--

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:56.860
instead of building a
cafeteria across the street,

00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:01.350
MIT should have jettisoned
its administrative facilities

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:05.970
and used this major
corridor as a place

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:10.260
for real public
exhibitions, for eating,

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.930
for people coming together.

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:13.455
It didn't.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.930
It lacked the
intelligence or the--

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:24.500
but so excessive
flexibility is very costly.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:30.660
One of the reasons you
can't do advanced science

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:35.070
in the old part of
MIT is because is

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:36.870
the infrastructure is too weak.

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:42.610
The sixth floor
of our building--

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:51.400
our building has six floors.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:58.180
Well, the sixth
floor is for animals.

00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:04.120
All of animals are
generally in basement.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:09.760
One of the future for building
university research facilities

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.780
given climate change--

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:20.920
New York University, the animal
laboratories in the basement

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.840
all flooded.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:26.200
All the research was lost.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:31.870
We put ours up in the
sky for no clear reasons.

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:36.070
We thought the animals would be
better off in there than down

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:37.420
in the basement.

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.570
And nobody disagreed.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:46.000
On top of that floor is a floor
of machines, machines which

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.700
look like airplane systems.

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:58.960
Because the building is a
laboratory which has to account

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:04.930
for research which requires
highly specialized vectors

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:14.470
of steam, light, all kinds
of elements which the ceiling

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:18.340
depths of about 18
inches, or 2 feet,

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:23.200
in places is so dense that you
cannot get another pipe through

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:23.700
there.

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:32.020
If MIT would have allowed us to
account for future flexibility,

00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:36.820
we would have made the depth
greater than the 18 inches

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:37.600
tube.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:41.100
It costs money.

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:44.220
We weren't allowed
to plan the building

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:50.245
with any space on the building
called TBA, To Be Added.

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:59.700
It's like packing
an aircraft carrier.

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:02.610
An aircraft carrier probably
can change internally.

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:08.800
But anyway, let's move
on with these diagrams.

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.860
We're got a few minutes left.

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:19.250
The Potteries Thinkbelt
in 1966, was Cedric Price,

00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:24.020
the British architect's, attempt
to do a couple of things--

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:26.480
to eliminate the
idea of a campus

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:31.160
from having separateness
from the rest of urbanism.

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:42.270
He decided to place
this British university

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:48.830
in an area of suffering economic
decline in Staffordshire.

00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:55.970
He argued that this
embedding of the University

00:49:55.970 --> 00:50:01.130
into the society's needs
would spontaneously

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:07.960
produce another kind
of university, such

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:11.560
as it would stimulate the
economy, for instance,

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:19.030
through promoting a
landlady industry and so on.

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:23.460
Instead of building
university dormitories,

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:40.130
I showed you a project in New
York by the Ford Foundation,

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:45.620
which attempted to do the same
thing that, instead of building

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:49.280
university dormitories,
create a market

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:53.180
for the supply of housing
by the poor people

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.710
around the university.

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:03.370
The last of these plans is
the most famous of them.

00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:05.200
It's the Free
University in Berlin.

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:19.996
Shadrach Woods writes
about this plan.

00:51:19.996 --> 00:51:22.240
"We have not begun
by trying to give

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.820
fixed points within the system.

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:26.980
I know they will have this.

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:30.520
People make the identifiable
features, not the architect.

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:33.670
I do not want to make any
symbols to begin with.

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:35.410
I think that the
use of the building

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:38.050
create centers of activity.

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:40.730
The plan is really an
attempt not to make sense--"

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:41.950
and so on to begin with.

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:50.700
It's interesting
that the implication

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:57.240
is that, if you give an
opportunity for people

00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:00.840
to arrange themselves,
they will have the capacity

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:05.010
to do so in a correct
manner or in a manner that

00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:07.920
is correct for them.

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:13.110
This is a time when Noam
Chomsky was lecturing

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:17.700
about the innate
ability of a child

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:21.030
to construct a specific
system of interconnection

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:25.740
amongst concepts and
conditions of use and reference

00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:29.370
on the basis of scanty
and scattered evidence.

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:37.960
Is there DNA in human
beings which automatically

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:44.590
will be able to create better
space than a specialist guiding

00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:45.220
them?

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:49.210
Or what combination of the two?

00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:52.353
Classical anarchism is--

00:52:52.353 --> 00:52:53.770
AUDIENCE: That
would be the wisdom

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:57.122
of the crowd in that sense.

00:52:57.122 --> 00:52:58.580
JULIAN BEINART:
Well, as I can only

00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:04.760
judge from Shadrach Woods,
who was a very good architect,

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:07.220
this is absolutely
anti-classical.

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:15.330
The crowd will organize itself
as it goes along and works

00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:17.640
and studies.

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:22.230
There will be a
generation of space

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:27.330
which will be more the result of
the participation of the people

00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:28.830
than imposed on them.

00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:32.250
I'm putting it rather
crudely, the notion that there

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:38.430
is a DNA in all human beings,
according to Chomsky, which

00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:44.610
allows a child to
construct complex sentences

00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:48.720
without having been
told how to do it,

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.140
admittedly with the parents
and society around them

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:55.920
to guide them.

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:59.726
But Chomsky is fairly
well-established

00:53:59.726 --> 00:54:02.550
as an authority now.

00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:07.170
There's still controversy
around whether the DNA of people

00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:09.795
have this capacity
without much learning.

00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:17.170
My own position about--

00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:20.830
the Free University
has had a bad history.

00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:22.180
It's been vandalized.

00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:23.910
It's been destroyed.

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:30.400
It's had to be rebuilt. It
never fulfilled the promise

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:34.420
that Woods had for it.

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:37.870
So what we see through
all of these cases,

00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:45.010
from Sussex in '61 where the
armature of separated items

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:54.460
in a campus are dismantled
into a system, which

00:54:54.460 --> 00:55:02.680
is almost cybernetic in a sense,
free associations of networks

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:07.510
created freely over time
suggesting new relationships.

00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:14.265
The trouble with architecture
is that it's not easy.

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:22.460
You just can't take a piece of
paper and stick it on a wall.

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:26.330
The wall has to have bearing.

00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:29.270
Acoustics unfortunately
means that the only way

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:31.955
to separate sound is with mass.

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:38.250
The university is the
last place in the world

00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:44.580
to flitter around with stud
walls or prefabricated metal

00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:46.410
panels.

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:51.600
If we had a prefabricated
metal panel uninsulated,

00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.880
we wouldn't be able to
teach in this class.

00:55:56.530 --> 00:56:00.570
So again, the
Poisson distribution

00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:05.340
might guide one into knowing
the frequency of places which

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:09.130
need acoustic separation
versus those that

00:56:09.130 --> 00:56:13.230
don't in the same way that
the Loughborough possibility

00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:16.430
of making everything possible--

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:19.500
a Poisson distribution would
say that the likelihood

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:24.870
of wet laboratories occurring
in your campus are this.

00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:28.080
And, therefore, you should
only spend the money

00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:35.520
on a feasible solution, which
requires 70% of your buildings

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.890
to have this flexibility.

00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:42.930
The Stata building has no
wet laboratories in it.

00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:46.140
Therefore, it has nothing--

00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:48.330
I mean, if you knew
architecture well enough,

00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:51.150
you could look at the Stata
building and our building

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:53.910
and compare them
fundamentally and say,

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:56.040
the one has wet
laboratories, the one

00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:00.660
doesn't have any, by looking
at the amount of chimneys

00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:03.280
on the roof.

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:10.690
We have every kind of chimney
emanating smoke or gas,

00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:12.970
whatever comes from MIT.

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.630
The Stata building has nothing.

00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:20.940
There's a flat ceiling roof.

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:25.170
It's the only flat
plane in the building.

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:27.100
OK.

00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:35.580
I want to look briefly
at two other cases.

00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:37.725
The one is the--

00:57:37.725 --> 00:57:44.880
by the way, there's a
piece by William Fawcett

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:51.810
in the MIT Planning Journal,
one or two volumes ago,

00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:56.940
on flexible life, flexibility.

00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:01.650
It's called "Investment in
Flexibility, the Life Cycle

00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:05.700
Options Synthesis."

00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:10.620
He gives examples
of prediction which

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:14.610
is based on estimates of
outcome and the costing

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:17.430
of the estimates of outcome
and the decision which

00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:20.810
is based on the system.

00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:27.930
I'd also recommend that you read
something in Kevin Lynch's book

00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:30.990
What Time Is This Place?

00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:35.430
for an attempt, in the
space-time continuum,

00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:38.930
to play around with
the idea of time.

00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:41.610
There's a page in which he
goes through a whole number

00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:46.080
of possibilities
of changing time.

00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:50.820
And he doesn't speculate about
his implications on space.

00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:59.680
I'm going to skip a bunch of
stuff and end with the last two

00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.120
because we won't have time.

00:59:05.287 --> 00:59:09.290
I'll deal with this
mainly through the slides.

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:16.360
I can't find the right place.

00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:23.950
The two cases are the use
of temporary environment

00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:26.860
of a fairly large
scale in cities.

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:37.120
The one is the story of
Paris between 1855 and 1900.

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.520
After the success of
the Crystal Palace

00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:43.510
Exhibition in 1851
in London, the French

00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:47.215
built an exhibition in 1855.

00:59:47.215 --> 00:59:57.220
And almost every 11 years
afterwards, 1855, 1867, 1878,

00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:03.400
1889, and 1900, it
had an exhibition,

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.880
a temporary exhibition, a
major temporary exhibition

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.780
in the center of Paris
just north of the Seine

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:12.563
and largely south of the Seine.

01:00:16.922 --> 01:00:20.630
I'll go through some of the
material with the slides,

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:31.370
but let me read you a quote
from the French novelist

01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:36.230
Jean Giraudoux
about the existence

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:40.220
of a temporary
city in conjunction

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:43.570
with a permanent city.

01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:45.970
He's talking about
the citizens of Paris.

01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:47.830
"They are delighted
by the thought

01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:50.470
of reaching this
cardboard or plaster

01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:55.790
city, which is a permanent
stone site of Paris."

01:00:55.790 --> 01:01:02.325
What an extraordinary idea,
that part of your city

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:06.740
is rotating at a faster
speed than the other parts.

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:14.280
The Free University of
Berlin has no stone site.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.670
It only has transparency.

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:22.590
Maybe you need a balance between
stone site and cardboard.

01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:27.370
He goes on.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:35.020
"They do not come to see it
disguised and transvestized

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:35.520
Paris."

01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:44.230
The exhibitions are
not transvestized

01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:48.140
Paris, not changed Paris.

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:49.250
But they are unique.

01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:51.110
They are on their own.

01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:54.980
"They come attracted
by the temporary union

01:01:54.980 --> 01:02:00.560
of an ephemeral city with a
millennial one, the association

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.780
of the most eccentric
city with the most

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:04.970
real and tangible one."

01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:07.340
It's an extraordinary
idea that you

01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:13.325
keep the center of your city
to change at a more rapid rate.

01:02:13.325 --> 01:02:23.780
I'll show you slides of 1867
being the first structure

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:25.400
and the demolition.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.650
That takes place within
a period of 11 years.

01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:33.470
So every child in the city
is seeing construction

01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:40.260
and destruction until 1900.

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:46.040
Of course, the most significant
event takes place in 1889

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:53.630
and considered a
temporary phenomenon.

01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:55.880
The Eiffel Tower is
the most permanent

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:58.940
of all phenomena in Paris.

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:04.940
So again, out of this
temporary sea of change,

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:10.100
there are a couple of
items which remain and log

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:13.280
into a system of permanence.

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.920
Although the Eiffel
Tower was regarded

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:22.190
as an American structure, easily
taken apart and assembled,

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:27.740
a fabricated structure unlike
the solid neoclassical form

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:31.220
of a Parisian facade.

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:35.420
The Trocadéro, which was on
the other side of the Seine

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:37.220
in the 1878--

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:41.450
the 1889 exhibition,
was demolished.

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:46.670
Although it had a plaster
facade and looked as

01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:49.320
if it had been there forever.

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:54.740
So these juxtapositions are
interesting in themselves.

01:03:54.740 --> 01:04:00.590
The last and the most permanent
of temporary phenomena

01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:01.700
are the Olympic Games.

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:14.280
In 1896, the Olympic
Games was an attempt

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:24.000
to recapitulate one of
Greece's ongoing traditions.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.240
That is the ancient site
of Olympia 776 BC, which

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:35.280
consisted of two components, a
permanent religious component

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:41.850
with priests dealing with flames
and an outdoor camp series

01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:49.140
of components, gymnasia,
stadia, palestra, health spa,

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:55.290
and so on dealing with
a cultural attribute

01:04:55.290 --> 01:05:01.320
of the body being performed in
competition every four years.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:10.140
In 1896, [INAUDIBLE] decided
to make some mileage out

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:14.520
of reclaiming this idea.

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:18.510
1900, the Olympic Games
were held in Paris

01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:23.420
at the time of the
1900 Exposition.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:25.050
The Olympic Games was nothing.

01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:26.565
It was a joke.

01:05:26.565 --> 01:05:29.400
The Exposition was everything.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:35.580
The swimmers swam the
races in the Seine.

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:40.050
The discus throwers had to throw
the discus in the [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:41.130
in amongst the trees.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.090
But it was a single
event because you

01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:51.740
do two vectors, the
growth of the exhibition

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:55.670
movement from 1855
to 1900 and then

01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:58.490
the decline of the
exhibition movement

01:05:58.490 --> 01:06:01.790
and then the advent
of the Olympic Games

01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:05.330
transplacing the exhibitions.

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:10.310
The Games didn't succeed.

01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:14.630
1904, it came to the
United States in St. Louis.

01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:17.180
Maybe you don't realize
that the United States

01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:22.100
has had the Games four times.

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:22.600
Where?

01:06:25.426 --> 01:06:28.260
AUDIENCE: New York,
LA, and Atlanta.

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:30.780
JULIAN BEINART: New York
has never had the Games.

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:31.710
AUDIENCE: It's the--

01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:35.100
JULIAN BEINART: Los Angeles has
had it twice, in '32 and '84.

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:38.100
AUDIENCE: Wasn't there a
Winter Games in New York?

01:06:40.598 --> 01:06:42.390
JULIAN BEINART: That's
the Winter Olympics.

01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:43.820
I'm talking about
the Summer Games.

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:44.362
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:06:44.362 --> 01:06:46.500
JULIAN BEINART: Lake
Placid was the Winter Games

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.650
where American Hockey
team beat the Russians

01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:52.830
and caused enormous
xenophobia in this country.

01:06:56.490 --> 01:07:00.180
The Olympic Games really
only took off in '32

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:04.105
in Los Angeles, the
modern games that is.

01:07:04.105 --> 01:07:11.840
It's one of the
remarkable events.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.685
It was during the
Depression years.

01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:18.690
Only the French were
allowed to drink alcohol.

01:07:22.648 --> 01:07:25.270
Oh, it was remarkable.

01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:28.990
It made $1 million
profit despite the fact

01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:34.210
that not many people
could afford to come.

01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:41.620
'36 was the acme of Hitler's
performance in Berlin.

01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:44.980
AUDIENCE: How do
you think the films

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:49.400
of Leni Riefenstahl sort of
played a role in the Olympics?

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.870
JULIAN BEINART: Well,
Leni Riefenstahl's film--

01:07:52.870 --> 01:08:00.520
at the 1988 Games in Seoul, I
was asked to do a presentation.

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:04.510
And I showed the introduction
to Leni Riefenstahl's film

01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:09.250
as opposed to the '84
Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:13.810
Riefenstahl, in case you
don't know Leni Riefenstahl,

01:08:13.810 --> 01:08:15.250
she was the German.

01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:23.529
She was the very cryptic and
all over the place German

01:08:23.529 --> 01:08:26.170
filmmaker who made Olympia.

01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:32.229
She convinced Goebbels
and Hitler to record.

01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:35.109
They were very proud of the
fact that Hollywood couldn't

01:08:35.109 --> 01:08:38.710
make a film of the '32 Games.

01:08:38.710 --> 01:08:41.090
I will show you
some of the still

01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:44.529
photographs from the '32 Games.

01:08:44.529 --> 01:08:48.550
But Hitler said, we are
going to make a film.

01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:51.729
And I could go into some
detail about the film,

01:08:51.729 --> 01:08:56.200
but you can still find
Olympia in the 7-Eleven--

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.120
not 7-Eleven.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:01.689
What are the
sophisticated local video

01:09:01.689 --> 01:09:05.560
outlets here in Cambridge?

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.340
I don't know.

01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:09.100
AUDIENCE: It's all
on your computer now.

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.950
JULIAN BEINART: Well,
Michael, if you can find it

01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:14.972
on your computer, find it.

01:09:14.972 --> 01:09:15.954
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

01:09:21.527 --> 01:09:23.319
JULIAN BEINART: Let's
look at these images.

01:09:23.319 --> 01:09:23.859
I'm sorry.

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:25.359
I have to show--

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:27.630
I've written about
the Olympic Games.

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:29.019
It's in the reading for today.

01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:36.490
I've been to two Olympic Games.

01:09:36.490 --> 01:09:39.770
This is the last
meeting of CIAM.

01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:45.285
And the arguments had all to
do between the closed aesthetic

01:09:45.285 --> 01:09:51.970
of BBPR's building in Milan and
Giancarlos' building in Matera

01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:54.010
in the south of Italy.

01:09:54.010 --> 01:09:56.030
I haven't got time to go into.

01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.530
Next.

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:01.980
Some of the projects
of Team 10, this

01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:06.060
is Alison and Peter Smithson's
project for the Golden Lane

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:07.320
competition.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:10.950
You'll see the drawing
indicates an enormous attempt

01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:15.870
to create maximized
communication.

01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:20.620
Almost every level has people
on it doing something or other.

01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:23.970
Here is a building
which takes linear form.

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:30.950
And people are supposed
to socially condense,

01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:32.450
to use the Russian term.

01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:36.455
It's absolute nonsense.

01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:46.045
When I came to America, I
lived in 100 Memorial Drive.

01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:52.250
It's a skip-stop
elevator building,

01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:56.590
which means that you have
three times the volume going

01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:58.990
into the elevator.

01:10:58.990 --> 01:11:02.170
I picked up the
newspaper every morning

01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:05.420
quite early in the morning
outside the front of my door.

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:09.810
I never, in 10 years, ever saw
another person in the corridor.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.060
Next.

01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:19.580
Park Hill Sheffield, one of
the outgrowths of this system.

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:22.730
It's now being
rehabilitated and changed.

01:11:22.730 --> 01:11:26.240
You can see, again,
the whole idea

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:31.430
of the pedestrian
sidewalk, which

01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:40.310
is a sidewalk elevated in space,
is that people will use it to--

01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:43.800
there are just too few people
in a building of this kind,

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:50.040
in most residential buildings,
to generate enough--

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:53.940
as if communicating with
everybody who lives next to you

01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:54.710
is a good idea.

01:12:00.710 --> 01:12:09.260
I mean, it's a strange notion
in our thinking about urbanism

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:14.860
that we all Greeks
meeting in the area

01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:16.850
to discuss our local politics.

01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:23.780
We'll come back to
this when talking

01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:26.120
about the contemporary
American city.

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:28.910
But there's a mistaken
notion, I think sometimes

01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:32.960
argued by Richard
Sennett mistakenly,

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:40.220
that density of
population provides

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:44.570
intercourse between people
in a very spontaneous way.

01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:53.355
Yes, you can only get married
to somebody you meet in Philly.

01:12:53.355 --> 01:12:53.855
Next.

01:12:57.430 --> 01:13:02.050
Another notion by Candilis,
Josic, and Shadrach Woods'

01:13:02.050 --> 01:13:06.100
firm, the town of the
extension of Toulouse,

01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:10.480
Toulouse-le-Mirail,
the notion of the web.

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:14.470
A web, again, is an
architect geometric form

01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:20.215
which is meant to produce
important intersections.

01:13:20.215 --> 01:13:20.715
Next.

01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:28.610
Pérez de Arce, this
is in your hand.

01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:34.520
This is the story of
reurbanizing Chandigarh.

01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:41.990
You start off by
building a few things.

01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:46.190
Over time, these get added
to and added to and added to

01:13:46.190 --> 01:13:47.600
and added to.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:53.660
And the plan of the central
part of Corbusier changes

01:13:53.660 --> 01:14:06.230
over time as the growth
is consistent all along.

01:14:06.230 --> 01:14:07.730
So you start with very--

01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:16.130
as, I think, Louis Khan said,
I'd like to build a town--

01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:21.710
when he was working in Dhaka,
first out of mud and bricks.

01:14:21.710 --> 01:14:25.040
And in the end, it
will become a city

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:28.785
of gold, something like that.

01:14:28.785 --> 01:14:29.285
Next.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.400
Pérez de Arce's project.

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.710
The ultimate goal
would be to exhaust

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:47.170
the center of Chandigarh by
new construction, additions.

01:14:47.170 --> 01:14:50.470
That's the Secretariat
building in the distance

01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:55.840
and in the case of Louis Khan's
central complex in Dhaka.

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:05.120
De Arce says that, through
a selective additive

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:08.930
transformation, you
can change the city

01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:13.910
and build on existing systems
rather than create something

01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:17.085
from scratch every
time in a finished way.

01:15:17.085 --> 01:15:17.585
Next.

01:15:21.330 --> 01:15:24.840
The MIT campus, which
you all know well,

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:32.420
that's a diagram
from Maria's thesis.

01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:36.770
The project for the New
University of Bochum

01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:43.610
in Germany by Candilis,
Josic, and Woods,

01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:49.700
it has no elevations
on the outskirts.

01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:52.790
There are just points
of growth and expansion.

01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:56.690
They stopped expanding where
the topography curtails

01:15:56.690 --> 01:15:58.190
the expansion.

01:15:58.190 --> 01:16:01.610
There's a central line
through the system,

01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:06.800
but the whole idea is that this
is a space-time configuration

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:12.090
that can change at a speed
which is not yet determined.

01:16:12.090 --> 01:16:12.590
Next.

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:19.580
The University of
Zurich competition--

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:24.290
the university is a set of
spaces covered in red and blue

01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:26.750
with different rates of change.

01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:28.220
Forget about the
one on the right.

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:32.300
That's the University of
Pavia by Giancarlo de Carlo.

01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:35.030
Next.

01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:40.130
Loughborough-- the 50 foot by
50 foot module fully serviced.

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:50.150
Next-- the French Paris
story and the Olympic games.

01:16:55.180 --> 01:17:00.340
The white space is the
transformed white space

01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:07.240
of the center of Paris
from 1855 to 1900.

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:14.710
On the right are the various
exposition artifacts.

01:17:14.710 --> 01:17:21.520
On the middle at the top
is the first 1855 pavilions

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:24.010
on the Champs-Élysées.

01:17:24.010 --> 01:17:28.540
1900, they rebuilt,
as they are today,

01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:32.890
and linked to a system across
the Seine on the south.

01:17:32.890 --> 01:17:41.200
1867, on the left, is the
perfect around the world form.

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:47.980
1868, it crosses the Seine.

01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:53.863
And they build the
[INAUDIBLE] on the left bank--

01:17:53.863 --> 01:17:59.630
no, it's on the right
bank in French and so on.

01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:09.150
You get the advent of the
Eiffel Tower here, 1889.

01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:12.930
You have the contrast between
the apparent temporariness

01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:15.660
of this building and the
apparent permanence of this.

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:25.600
1937, this one goes, but
the Eiffel Tower stays.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:26.100
Next.

01:18:32.170 --> 01:18:40.270
1855-- the two buildings
just west of the blue,

01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:44.140
the Champs-Élysées.

01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:49.150
Continuing here-- the
Champs-Élysées and the two

01:18:49.150 --> 01:18:53.980
replacement buildings
for the 1900 Exposition.

01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:57.020
I can't reach with my hand.

01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:57.520
Next.

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:13.460
In 1867-- 1878, next.

01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:22.580
1867, every 11 years you
see this cycle every time

01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:26.780
in the construction of
something which is ephemeral.

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:30.200
Then it is-- this is 1867--

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:31.340
being removed.

01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:33.860
Next.

01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:38.510
Delaunay's painting,
this painting

01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:46.550
is a number of features about
the existential condition

01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:52.100
of the Eiffel Tower as
a symbol in the city.

01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:56.930
And here is an example
of a neoclassical system,

01:19:56.930 --> 01:20:01.490
which has much apparent
meaning embedded in it.

01:20:01.490 --> 01:20:05.000
But is easily removable
as opposed to that.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.020
You can contrast the
meaning of these two items

01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:10.070
in the urban system.

01:20:13.210 --> 01:20:15.000
Why is the Eiffel
Tower still there?

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:22.680
It produces more income than any
other public feature in Paris.

01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:29.730
Paris is the largest
tourist city in the world.

01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:34.770
It spends more money per
capita on cleaning the city

01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:39.325
than any other city in
the world, city comment.

01:20:39.325 --> 01:20:39.825
Next.

01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:47.400
And the final
resolution in 1937--

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.940
where the two winners
are the Russian pavilion

01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:52.125
and the German pavilion.

01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:59.410
Our friend Melnikov's design
for the '37 Exposition

01:20:59.410 --> 01:21:01.465
was never built. Next.

01:21:04.570 --> 01:21:07.300
The plan of the
original Olympic Games--

01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:11.710
the inner core of the
temple of Zeus and Hera.

01:21:11.710 --> 01:21:16.960
And outside-- the palestra,
the wrestling, the gymnasium,

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:22.120
the bathhouses, the
guesthouse, the Hippodrome,

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.530
and the stadium.

01:21:23.530 --> 01:21:29.350
So there's the plan for the
Olympic Games in Munich--

01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:33.370
when was Munich, '72?

01:21:33.370 --> 01:21:35.260
I think '72.

01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:38.140
'68 was Mexico City.

01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:43.320
I used to know the dates
all, but I'm sorry.

01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:43.820
Next.

01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:55.300
1896 in Athens, 1900 in Paris--

01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:57.930
next.

01:21:57.930 --> 01:22:03.840
1904 in the United States, which
is part of an international--

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:07.680
much like Paris in
1900, 1904 is part

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.130
of an international festival.

01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:21.110
Here-- bushmen from South
Africa produced to dance.

01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:24.860
Bushmen started running
in the marathon,

01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:30.980
were chased off the course
by dogs and didn't finish.

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:32.330
The whole system is--

01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:42.860
the wonderful
museum of St. Louis,

01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:44.750
the art museum the
St. Louis, is still

01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:51.300
based on the site of the
original exposition in 1904.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:51.800
Next.

01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:59.560
1932, this is one
of the wonderful set

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:04.390
of still photographs
taken of the games in '32.

01:23:07.230 --> 01:23:07.730
Next.

01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:15.640
Interesting, here we have,
for the first time, the reuse

01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:18.040
of a stadium.

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:21.670
On the left is the vice
president of the United States

01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:22.540
in person.

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:27.160
Mr. Garner-- I think
his name was Garner--

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.900
opening an exhibition.

01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:33.610
In 1984, security is so tight
that the President Ronald

01:23:33.610 --> 01:23:37.540
Reagan appears only
electronically,

01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:39.205
but the building
remains the same.

01:23:42.490 --> 01:23:43.930
One of the
extraordinary things--

01:23:43.930 --> 01:23:45.620
well, we'll see it
in the next slide.

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:46.120
Next.

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:55.540
Berlin in '36-- the flame from
the connection to original area

01:23:55.540 --> 01:24:01.810
in Greece and arriving in Berlin
with Hitler on the stadium

01:24:01.810 --> 01:24:03.125
podium.

01:24:03.125 --> 01:24:03.625
Next.

01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:15.020
Sorry, I think that's the
wrong slide I believe.

01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:20.630
The slide that's supposed
to be on the left

01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:27.260
shows the network of the Los
Angeles '32 and '84 stadium.

01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:31.190
Transportation wise, it
has worked remarkably well

01:24:31.190 --> 01:24:40.130
because it allows distribution
of traffic in every 360 degree

01:24:40.130 --> 01:24:43.250
directions.

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:46.850
This is Speer's
project for Hitler

01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:51.680
for 400,000 people, which would
eliminate the Olympic Games

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:56.895
configuration and hardly
be able to anybody to see.

01:24:56.895 --> 01:24:57.395
Next.

01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:02.040
Some of the plans--

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.440
this is Seoul.

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:10.200
Most of the stadia are
built on park land.

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:15.425
The wonderful Olympic Village
by Kyu Sung Woo-- at the top.

01:25:15.425 --> 01:25:15.925
Next.

01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:26.810
I just have cut out most
of the other slides.

01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:35.810
This is two aspects
to the American--

01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:39.150
a couple aspects of
the Olympic Games.

01:25:39.150 --> 01:25:42.090
The Olympic Games are
temporary events in cities.

01:25:42.090 --> 01:25:45.210
They've been used,
for cities like Tokyo,

01:25:45.210 --> 01:25:49.590
to argue for building a freeway
system or building new housing.

01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:57.450
They've been used by countries
like contemporary China,

01:25:57.450 --> 01:26:04.560
Tokyo in 1960, Melbourne in
'56, to introduce the city

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:11.400
as an internationally
important place for trade,

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:18.000
for psychological
satisfaction, and so on.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.520
Los Angeles and the
American Olympic Games

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:27.780
at Atlanta and Los
Angeles have argued

01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:33.960
that you can reuse
existing infrastructure,

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:38.700
that you can capitalize
on the existing resources

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:40.500
already in the city.

01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:44.460
The '84 games builds
no new housing.

01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:49.510
The Olympic Village is
based on campus housing

01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:55.060
in the University of
Southern California.

01:26:55.060 --> 01:27:00.030
The only new facility built in
'84 is the swimming pool paid

01:27:00.030 --> 01:27:03.150
for by McDonald's.

01:27:03.150 --> 01:27:07.080
So there is not only a
notion of the private sector

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.060
playing a role, which--

01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:15.360
the IOC, which is a
semi-fascist organization,

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:22.010
corrupt as hell,
controlling the franchise.

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:30.000
The Los Angeles
Games is widespread,

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.230
distributed according
to the plan of the town.

01:27:34.230 --> 01:27:41.940
The Games in Barcelona are
also very tightly associated

01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:45.600
with the major form of
the city, the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:47.510
Next.

01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:54.410
Just the Olympic 1928 on
the right, the American team

01:27:54.410 --> 01:28:02.720
is housed in a boat, the
ultimate ephemeral item.

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:03.800
This is Cape Town.

01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:07.190
I was going to talk
about Cape Town's attempt

01:28:07.190 --> 01:28:13.430
to use racial integration as
a social basis for the plan

01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:15.590
of the Olympic Games.

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:16.550
They never entered.

01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:18.860
Next.

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:23.780
And the project for the
Olympic Games in Boston,

01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:27.290
reusing the river and
the university facilities

01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:29.450
along the river as the core.

01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:34.340
And here is an indication
of how much the Games cost

01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:39.370
and the division between the
private and public sector.
