00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.760
JULIAN BEINART: You'll
recall the last class was

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.880
a third of conceptual
models, this one dealing

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.330
with the organic shape of
nature and its replication

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.740
in patterning of cities.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:50.240
We focused on a number
of examples, one of which

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.560
was the work of Patrick Geddes.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.920
The second one was the work of
Ebenezer Howard and the garden

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.710
city movement.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.830
The third was the work of
Clarence Stein in the United

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.330
States.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.520
And then I did a short
run through of a piece

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.870
that I wrote last year
for a conference in Athens

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.560
on nature and the
city, in which I

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.945
argued that there was the most
dynamic thing about cities.

00:01:29.945 --> 00:01:35.990
It is our human capacity to
learn and to adapt to change.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.610
And I try to show
that in the life of 70

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.860
years of the Tennessee
Valley Authority,

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.580
the capacity to change
the perspective about what

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.440
nature is.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.410
Nature is no static phenomenon.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.670
It's a learning of
patterns as previously

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.090
identified in organic systems--

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.110
selectively.

00:02:15.032 --> 00:02:18.190
So it requires the human brain.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:28.310
And the Tennessee
Valley Authority

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:36.370
built 28 dams on the concept
that dams, that water power,

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.920
was more hygienic and would
be sufficient for creating

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.420
a new industrial zone in the
eight states of the Tennessee

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.240
Valley.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.610
65% of the power now is
not generated by water.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.260
The prediction of the
economic growth in this region

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.580
was very low.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.320
Also, the capacity of the
water to produce enough energy

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.880
was low.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.120
So what happened?

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.060
Coal became the substitute.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.810
Coal led to strip mining, which
is as anti-natural phenomenon

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.650
as you can imagine.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.250
The largest environmental
disaster in the United States

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.950
happened in the
coal spill from one

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:35.750
of the coal-generating
plants, and so on, and so on.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.240
And we went through
an argument which

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.210
suggests that nature is
still a phenomenon which

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:49.200
is understood through the
process of the human brain.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.705
There's no absolute
correctness of nature.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.230
Biomorphism is a foolish
project by architects

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.650
who should understand a
much broader interpretation

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.110
of history and culture
than to select items

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.830
from array of natural forms.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.019
It's purely a selection.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.920
Yes, maybe-- we
have no measurement

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.800
that people are more
satisfied in a forest

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:35.160
than on Fifth
Avenue in New York.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.050
We assume that to be true.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.740
I suppose we could if
we got honest people

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.230
in a questionnaire.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.690
But Marx was right,
that the establishment

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.830
of the first settlement set
up a duality between country

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.810
and city, which is going to
take a lot of time to resolve.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.970
And it's still problematic.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:21.730
What I've given you today are
some functional descriptive

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.715
theories borrowed mainly
from the social sciences.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.860
I will go through each
of them with an example,

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.590
and discuss what the theory
is, and what it proposes,

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.750
what its weaknesses are.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.250
This used to be a whole subject
for a whole semester in city

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.350
planning education.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.150
It's hardly dealt with now.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.100
Part of these are
classical series,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.230
which no longer are
interesting to anybody.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:59.020
The second page-- the first
page deals with the application

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.250
of one of these theories--

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.270
Hoyt's to Atlanta.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:10.450
You can see the sector
theory in Atlanta,

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:17.470
indicating the location of
high-income white housing as

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:24.250
opposed to low-income housing,
following a model purported

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:30.990
by Homer Hoyt in 1935.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.300
The next page deals
with examination

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.310
of two figures in Great
Britain, who lived

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.560
more or less at the same time--

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:51.870
John Ruskin, the
theorist of painting,

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.030
and Friedrich Engels, who we
will discuss more fully in two

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.980
weeks, in a week's
time, one of the origins

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.780
of the modern
Communist Manifesto.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:11.910
And in 1845, at
the age of 25, he

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.470
wrote one of the greatest
books on urbanism ever written,

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.180
The Condition of the
Working Class in England,

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.290
which we'll discuss when
we talk about the origins

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.570
of the industrial city.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:29.460
The next page is from
a diagram by Mel Weber

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.330
in a book called Urban Place
and Non-Place Urban Realm.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:39.630
This was a set of studies,
which is published

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.520
in this book, [INAUDIBLE],, and
in another book called Cities

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:50.760
and Space, which deal with the
advent of the interpretation

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.810
of different systems
of communication

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.650
interacting in one place.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:07.050
This is an oppositional position
to the conventional economic

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:12.720
models, or even physical
models, of interaction,

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:20.460
and an old model by a book
called A Communications Theory

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:26.880
of Urban Growth looking at the
measurement of intersections

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.780
in complementary
functions in spatial form.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:35.774
And the last-- this
is the next page--

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:44.890
he's from economic
geography and represents

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:46.850
population potential diagrams.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.330
And then next, we will finish
with a very recent piece

00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:01.450
from The New York Times in which
a physicist solves the city.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:09.850
This is hopefully what
we will finish with.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:16.540
The question is, does it
really make any sense at all?

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:21.730
But we'll look at the work
of these people dealing

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:26.600
with models of complex
theory at the moment.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.590
The first-- let's go
through this very quickly.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:35.260
The first-- by the
way, these breakdowns

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.980
were created in this
class with Kevin Lynch

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.870
and follows them,
to some extent.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:49.150
Cities are seen as unique
historical processes.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:53.610
Each city is a unique
cumulative historical process.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:58.060
A city can only be explained
by telling a story.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.770
You cannot generalize
very much about cities.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:05.170
What you can generalize
about is the way

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.950
of reading a city,
the idea you have

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.710
to learn the standard
way of looking at them.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:18.190
So, for instance, Rasmussen
says two chief types

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.090
are distinguishable
among large cities--

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.790
the concentrated
and the scattered.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.220
The former is the more
common on the continent.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.700
It's clearly represented by the
big government seats of Paris,

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.840
and Vienna, and so on.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:37.120
The second type is represented
by the English town, which now,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.730
to many of us, seems ideal.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:49.330
The question of what is
unique and what is generalized

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.170
is different in some
of these propositions,

00:10:53.170 --> 00:11:00.185
even within this proposition
of the unique historic process.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:09.380
You have a book, like Allan
Jacobs' book on streets, which,

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.380
by the way, doesn't include
the Nevsky Prospect, which

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.360
is one of the great
streets in the world.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.840
It's only streets that
Allen Jacobs has visited.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.430
In science, I don't know if
you can do experimentation

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:27.620
on the basis of only what you
have visited, but it's OK.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:33.530
We are handicapped.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:45.680
But the cities, the
streets, that he identities,

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.700
each is unique.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.830
It gives measurements
of its width.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:53.120
It gives dimensions of the
density around the street.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.670
Whereas, Bill
Hillier's proposition,

00:11:55.670 --> 00:12:01.760
which I'll discuss next Tuesday
amongst others, Space Syntax,

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.550
looks at streets
merely as linkages

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:07.580
in a topological
environment in which,

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.230
if you understand the
geometry of flows,

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.880
you can really make
generalizations about crime,

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.110
about social
behavior, and so on.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:24.740
So there's often this tension
between what is conservative

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:29.030
unique to be
reproduced and what is

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:32.030
generalizable from
that phenomenon.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:38.000
I was on a review last
January at Columbia

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.200
for a project that
students did in Palestine,

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.980
in a small town in
Palestine, sponsored

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:54.860
by RIFAC, an NGO which is trying
to establish Palestinian space.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.480
And this was a project
for a small town which

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.810
had had no economic
base, but the students

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:08.180
were privileged
to study the town

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:13.460
and come up with suggestions
for a new economic base.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:18.080
All the students took the
form of the city, that is,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.190
the architecture-- and even
although it was only partially

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.630
still in use--

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:27.080
as the basis for
its reconstruction.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.440
There was something about
its history, its presence,

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.620
which needed to be adapted.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:44.840
So if some student, excuse me,
proposed to start a herbal drug

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:51.335
industry, they did it in an
adapted shelter already there.

00:13:51.335 --> 00:13:55.400
If somebody wanted to start
a new business in vinegar

00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.720
production in Palestine,
they took an old building,

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.820
and if it was not large enough,
they added a small fraction.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.550
One student came along
and said the biggest

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:10.910
problem in this town
is garbage collection.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.340
Garbage is not
properly collected,

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:18.670
and decays, and causes a very
unhealthy feeling in the town.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.970
I'm proposing a new
garbage collection center

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.160
on the outskirts of the town.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.370
And he designed a
mechanical instrument which

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.650
collected garbage effectively.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.850
Everybody attacked the
student who did this project.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:42.260
The historical sense
of conservation

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:48.230
and conservative appropriation
was so overwhelming

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:53.390
that the student who
proposed that a city may

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:58.040
be a place in which people
can learn, and can grow,

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.210
and change--

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:07.620
they do anyway-- there wasn't
much debate about the student's

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.850
proposition.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:09.930
I kept quiet.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.330
I should have said something.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.740
But it was in New York, and
I felt like a provincial

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:17.710
from Boston.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:21.570
So I had nothing to say.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.560
But it was a very good
example of the postulation

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:35.730
that the uniqueness of
the historical process

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:40.290
can withstand notions
of change and growth.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:46.470
The fascination with the
concept of learning from--

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:50.310
of being instructed
by what you see

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.460
has suggested the
word "reading."

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.275
Reading is used in
a number of cases.

00:15:56.275 --> 00:16:00.360
It's used by the architect
Giancarlo De Carlo

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:07.660
in the ILAUD schools in Italy.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:14.250
And so I took two
examples by two great men.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:22.480
John Ruskin says, number
one, the vocation is seeing.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:27.820
He talks about growing up in
a small village in England,

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.350
and there was nothing to do.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:38.080
So he looked through the
windows to the house next door

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.688
and started learning how
to pattern the brickwork.

00:16:42.688 --> 00:16:45.130
Now, this is something
that I suppose

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.170
not everybody should do.

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:50.780
I think we have more
intelligent things to do.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:56.620
But he talks about seeing as
a constructive phenomenon,

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:01.580
as an intellectual activity,
which can be learned.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.880
It's not automatic.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.089
From a visual to the
social-political,

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:14.589
he's a professor of poetry
at Oxford University, one

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:19.420
of the most important
chairs in British academia,

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.319
and slowly turns his
attention to the fact

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:26.589
that there's a
distinction in Britain

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.195
between poverty and wealth.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:36.950
His last books, Fors Clavigera,
is subtitled, Lessons

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.058
to the Working Men of England.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.420
He takes students
on Sunday morning

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:48.050
to work and building
camps outside Oxford.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.460
He sees that reading
is a combination

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.420
of aesthetic and moral values.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.160
He says you have to
externalize the consequences

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.440
of your experience.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.470
Therefore, he writes
these books and has

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.630
something to say about
reading and memory--

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.700
how memory is an important part
of the selective part of what

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:20.810
you understand.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:24.375
Friedrich Engels comes to
Manchester as a teenager.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:32.270
He's amazed at his
contact with reality.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.460
First of all, you have
to understand that it's

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.160
important to observe reality.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:43.400
Reality, in his case, was
the most degraded conditions

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:49.220
of housing and sewage that the
world had probably ever seen.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.810
He says, you do it
with your body--

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:56.540
with eyes, ears, nose, and feet.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:00.680
Number three, you do it
through the eyes of others.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:09.140
He had a girlfriend who was
an illiterate Irish worker.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.710
He walked through
the town with her

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.870
and would ask her questions.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.530
I don't understand why the
window's always closed.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.840
And she would say, the
windows are closed,

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.206
because the smell
is too whatever.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:38.630
And then you communicate
what you've read,

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.660
and you go even further.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:47.810
In his case, Manchester was
not a unique city for him.

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.450
He was reading a
phenomenon which

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:54.760
had universal implications.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:59.620
It's interesting that
under Marx and Engels,

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:06.520
and as late as 1917, cities were
not considered as significant

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.905
in the Marxist dialogue.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.050
They were larger issues at hand.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:19.760
You had to change the structure
of society, and as a byproduct,

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.790
cities would change
automatically.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:26.480
That doesn't work that way,
but so was the doctrine

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.800
of early Soviet Marxism.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.550
And Engels himself changed.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:38.810
There's a wonderful book
called Marx's General recently

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:45.230
published by an English
writer, which discusses Engel's

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:48.365
history in relation to Hegel.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:57.210
Engels was in the army
in Berlin doing nothing.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:01.080
So he attended a class in
religious philosophy taught

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.780
at the university.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:07.040
At that time, religion was
a fundamental component

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.950
of the study of philosophy.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:21.200
In his class was Kierkegaard,
Bakunin, the Russian anarchist.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.870
I forget the names
of the others--

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:30.260
people who were there at the
same time questioning whether--

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:36.500
Hegel's work had just been
started to be published.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:43.970
And Engels, again,
started adapting

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:50.780
the purest Marxist
doctrines to the reality

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:55.970
of the situations he was facing
in different parts of Europe

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:58.160
as he traveled.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:06.710
The notion of historians who
claim the uniqueness of cities

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:10.280
is widespread.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:15.920
Writing about
Venice, Mary McCarthy

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.400
says, there's nothing more
to be said about Venice,

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:25.130
and quotes Napoleon, Raskin,
Shelly, Proust all saying

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.230
the same things.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:29.690
And says, I envy your
writing about Venice,

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.040
says the newcomer.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.750
I pity you, says the old hand.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:37.310
There's something a
little boring about saying

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:40.760
the same things about a city.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.840
Walter Benjamin is a much
more lively character,

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:49.560
the German philosopher
who died in 1940,

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.400
but wrote essays on cities.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:57.680
His essay on Naples is
particularly interesting.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:02.180
Nevertheless, no city can fade
in the few hours of Sunday rest

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.080
more rapidly than Naples.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.110
Here's a theory of the speed
at which the city changes

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:12.140
its form from working to rest.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.060
I don't know of any
other person who's

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:19.190
ever observed the
phenomenon of the speed

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:23.760
that cities change from
one form to another.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:32.280
He says, the well-known list of
the seven deadly sins located

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.730
pride in Genoa,
avarice in Florence,

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:39.570
voluptuousness in Venice, anger
in Bologna, greed in Milan,

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.880
envy in Rome, and
indolence in Naples.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:52.800
He then goes on to talk
about what indolence means,

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.740
and porosity of
buildings, and builds

00:23:55.740 --> 00:24:00.900
an incredible central
structure of this place.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.280
What you do with it
is not important.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:09.390
It's that a city is something
as particular as the gestures

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.340
that people make
with their hands.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.790
He claims that the gestures that
people make with their hands,

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:17.820
with their nose, with their
eyes, with their breasts

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.440
in Naples is unique.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.520
AUDIENCE: So?

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:31.760
JULIAN BEINART: So the
extraordinary thing

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:38.000
about Walter Benjamin is this
tension between this attitude

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.980
of finding the deep structural
explanation of cities

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.070
and being a Marxist himself.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:48.920
As a Marxist, like
Engels, he would only

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:54.380
see Naples as a generalized
phenomenon of human experience.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.090
He would look for
where poor people live,

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:03.690
and where the forces of
production were, and so on.

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:07.970
Instead, he's attracted by
this uniqueness phenomenon.

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.100
Everything is unique.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:14.780
He writes about Paris
in similar ways.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.210
Muchly is interesting
in Walter Benjamin,

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.580
over whom I'm a big fan.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.550
So I shouldn't
criticize him too much.

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:27.470
Here's the architectural
critic, Norberg-Schulz,

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:33.200
the Norwegian critic, who
has made a-- who wrote a book

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.100
called Genius Loci,
which suggests, again,

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.470
that every town has a genius--

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:40.460
not every town.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.700
He only selects a
couple, and then

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.940
tries to explain
what the genius is.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.740
So in Prague, we
read the following.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.520
"The fascination of Prague
resides, first of all,

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.100
in a strong sense of mystery."

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.990
Big deal, you know?

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:03.260
You have the feeling it
is possible to penetrate

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.420
ever deeper into things.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.890
"Streetscapes, courtyards,
have an endless inside."

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:14.840
Now, that is maybe a profound
observation of Prague.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:21.620
But as a theory, it
is terribly little.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:27.200
It's very much-- in Khartoum--

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.130
he says, those who visit
Khartoum are immediately struck

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:36.960
by strong quality of place.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:42.860
Well, am I not struck by a
strong quality of place if I

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.720
enter Léon?

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:49.460
Or is there a measurement of
the amount of quality that is

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.770
in Khartoum as opposed to Léon?

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.290
There is no attempt to
generalize about cities

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:57.120
whatsoever.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.700
If science is about
generalization,

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.465
this is not anywhere
near scientific.

00:27:02.465 --> 00:27:07.740
It's maybe what architects
do in reading or artists do,

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:13.590
which raises a very big
unresolved conflict in urbanism

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:19.680
between if it is a function of
art or a function of science.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:27.450
Theories are especially seen
as functions, as estimates,

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:32.370
of knowledge in science
and in social science.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:34.350
We have not resolved--

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:43.720
to propose, as we end up with
this piece by the physicists,

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.510
on what is important
to resolve in urbanism,

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:51.030
it may be that
the distinction is

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.510
between learning about
cities through art history.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:58.050
Because if you look at
Prague, you think of looking

00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:59.430
at Cézanne.

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:03.900
And although Rudolf Arnheim,
the gestalt psychologist, says,

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.080
that if you look at Cézanne, if
you'd follow the following path

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:11.160
with your eyes from red to
yellow and back to green,

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:16.740
and these forms all fit into a
scientific explanation of what

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.915
you see, that's bullshit.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:29.560
We accept certain
truths through art.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.550
The patterning of
music is studied

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:37.240
and available for
your understanding,

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.860
but it is an intuitive
experiential phenomenon.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:49.750
Much of these explanations
are of that order.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:53.650
They don't attempt to
compare the amount of mystery

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.720
in Rome versus the
amount of mystery

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.955
in Khartoum or in Prague.

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:02.140
Let's go on very quickly.

00:29:05.308 --> 00:29:08.370
We've got half an hour.

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:10.570
There's a lot of
reading available

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:13.160
about each of these sectors.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.810
So I will propose
that, if you're

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:22.300
interested in any of
these bodies of work,

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:25.570
either contact me, and
I'll give you more reading.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:28.078
That's if you need
to do more reading.

00:29:28.078 --> 00:29:29.620
There's enough in
this class already.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:43.375
The next group of work is
number two, ecology of people.

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:50.350
The idea that
people, as a group,

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:55.960
behave in ways
which pattern a city

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:04.420
is most likely to be associated,
in the first instance,

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:12.590
with the work of the German
sociologists from 1900 to 1950.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:16.030
I'll just briefly mention
them and talk a little bit

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:18.760
about what the
fundamental thinking

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:23.410
about the nature of cities was.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:28.210
Max Weber in 1905--

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:34.300
the three are Max Weber,
Georg Simmel, S-I-M-M-E-L,

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.515
and Oswald Spengler.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:43.900
For them, cities
were relatively new.

00:30:47.225 --> 00:30:50.700
You must remember that
cities only grew at about 1%

00:30:50.700 --> 00:31:00.810
per annum in Europe until
1930, when parts of England

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:03.450
grew ballistically at about 10%.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.850
But it involved a
change in character.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:18.330
For Weber, a city is essentially
a human settlement, which

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:21.240
could be called cosmopolitan.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.750
It contains a variety
of life styles

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:27.370
and different sorts
of individuals

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.060
which have to coexist.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:35.130
He argues that the best
way for them coexisting

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:40.350
is to establish ideal typical
conditions in which each state

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:43.710
of urban life most
neatly fulfills

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:48.720
the social capacities inherent
in any of the one groups.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:58.970
So for him, an ideal city
would be the creation

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:07.880
of a phenomenon, which has a
large amount of distinction

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:18.500
in it, and the maintenance
of these social structures,

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:23.540
competing social structures,
the capacity to understand when

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:27.110
they change and when they don't.

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:37.080
He believes in the kind of
city that he was examining

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.330
in Germany at the time.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:45.090
Georg Simmel noticed another
phenomenon of the emerging city

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:46.260
form.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:52.400
And that is that it put pressure
on the individual existence.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:57.720
The access of psychic
stimulation in a large city

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.430
would cause withdrawal.

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:03.720
This is a strange concept.

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:12.090
It maybe associates
itself with people

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:15.540
like Richard
Sennett, who's spoken

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:20.910
about the fall of public
man in similar ways.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:27.300
That if in Simmel's case
it was the withdrawal

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:32.010
of people from the excessive
stimulation of the city,

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:35.850
in Richard Sennett's
case, it's the change

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:41.730
in the capacity of
people from maintaining

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:45.030
a state of publicness
to a preference

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:46.920
for a state of privacy.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:52.740
I disagree with Sennett to some
extent about that observation.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:57.330
As I'll deal with in
a subsequent class,

00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:03.090
the notion of privacy
was foreign to people

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:05.340
until the middle
of the Middle Ages.

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:14.204
But Simmel talks of this.

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:23.708
"Whenever large numbers
of people live together,

00:34:23.708 --> 00:34:26.239
there's a selfhood,
a human identity,

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:29.960
which tries to project
itself in the process.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:38.780
Just as an example
of this phenomenon,

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:44.179
if you would wish to
withdraw in Manhattan

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:52.520
from the intense energy
that the city has produced,

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.960
why would you have glass on
the windows of your apartment?

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.210
There's been some
study of the amount

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:02.660
of glass and residential
accommodation, even

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.370
to the extent that--

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:15.770
what is the file,
old film, where

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:18.380
this man is in his
apartment and he's

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.163
hurt his leg so he can't move?

00:35:20.163 --> 00:35:21.080
AUDIENCE: Rear Window.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.640
JULIAN BEINART:
Rear Window, yes.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.790
Who was the actor?

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:25.790
AUDIENCE: Jimmy Stewart.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.370
JULIAN BEINART:
Jimmy Stewart, yeah.

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:34.220
Sorry, my memory
is falling apart.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:42.260
The phenomenon that you
can use glass, as glass

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:49.010
gives you both the option of
withdrawing and being public.

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:52.370
It's an extraordinary idea.

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:56.820
That if you really-- if Simmel
were absolutely correct,

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.870
we would all live in
[INAUDIBLE],, or in gardens,

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:02.990
or anything
establishing ourselves

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:08.780
outside of the
turmoil of urbanism.

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:12.320
The glass apartment
block in Manhattan,

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:19.460
allowing people to see you
when you're ready to be seen,

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:26.930
but mostly available,
is a curious phenomenon.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:31.910
Simmel might have had
something to say about it.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:38.810
Oswald Spengler had a
typical negative view

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:46.250
of the future of the
emerging large city.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:52.220
He said, very popularly
understood at the time,

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:54.950
that there was something
wrong, that it needed

00:36:54.950 --> 00:37:01.550
to be curtailed in size,
that it's increasing

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:05.480
heterogeneity was a phenomenon
which was dangerous.

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:14.760
He believed that cities
would be destroyed.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.610
And I don't know what
would replace them.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:22.310
But he had this similar
idea to others in England,

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:27.920
that London would be dispersed
and into smaller communities,

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.380
largely in the rural
areas of England.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.340
A complete nonsense of
an idea, but one which--

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:47.130
none of these people attempted
to understand the sociology

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:50.190
of an actual city.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.600
They were generalists.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:58.860
I'm reminded a little in
reading of this of a book, which

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:09.462
was recently published by Edward
Glaser at Harvard, called The--

00:38:09.462 --> 00:38:10.960
AUDIENCE: Triumph of the City?

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.752
JULIAN BEINART: --Triumph
of the City, yes.

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:20.850
There isn't really time to
discuss this book at length.

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:23.190
But at some time in this
class, I would like to.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:25.980
So ask me a question about
it when we have more time.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.595
Its analysis is very much
in the old school manner.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:40.520
But if Spengler proposes
that cities will disappear

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:44.690
because they are too
crude, and they've

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:51.200
deviated from decent
human principles,

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.260
Glaser sees the
future of interaction

00:38:54.260 --> 00:39:01.860
in the modern city as
the essence of its being.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:07.430
He proposes that a good city
would intensify into action,

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:10.220
because it's economically
important, and so on,

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:13.310
and so on, and so on.

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:14.570
He's not an architect.

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:18.860
So his penchant
for tall buildings,

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:24.530
residential buildings,
are indiscriminate of how

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:27.710
they are designed, and how
they are modulated, and so on.

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:32.180
It reminds me of what's
happening in China,

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:33.380
amongst other places.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:42.330
The Chicago school were
a bunch of sociologists

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:44.210
who took a look at
the American city

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:48.070
for the first time analytically.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:55.190
The concentric model of
Park, Burgess, and McKenzie

00:39:55.190 --> 00:40:00.080
postulated a city, which is
much like a plant phenomenon,

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:05.300
that it increased and changed
as it expanded outwards.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:10.100
That the city consisted
of rings, annular rings,

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:17.270
of social classes in
which the dynamic was

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:20.690
that you would move from
the center to the outwards.

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:27.500
And the inner ring is the
center, the central business

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.040
district.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.110
Immediately surrounding
it is something

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:33.860
called the zone in transition.

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:41.660
Beyond that is the zone
of workingmen's houses.

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:45.020
Beyond that is the zone
of better residences.

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.790
Beyond that is
the commuter zone.

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:51.050
The zone of transition,
that immediate zone

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:54.980
around the central business
area, is of interest.

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:58.310
What distinguishes the American
city from the European Union

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:01.450
city in the grossest
sense is the American city

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:02.990
is city of immigration.

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:06.090
The European city is
quite the opposite.

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:10.760
It's only been open to
immigration recently,

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:13.790
and it's struggling like
hell to deal with it.

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:15.950
America's has gone
through a couple

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:20.720
of years, if not forever,
dealing with the problem

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.280
of immigration.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.520
And the zone of transition
in the American city

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.880
was that undetermined
zone, before

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.480
the settled residential
population took

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:35.220
place, a zone in transition.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:38.065
The obvious phenomenon
was that there's

00:41:38.065 --> 00:41:44.660
a zone which had a more rapid
turnover than any other zone

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:46.070
in the city.

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:49.160
And this has actually
been the zone

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.460
which is been a
zone of immigration,

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:57.620
a zone of building of bypasses
past the central business area.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:02.390
In fact, if anything,
it's a better flex zone

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:09.410
around the center of a city than
the park system of Adelaide,

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:12.560
which the organic model
is so enthused about.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:22.760
There was a gentleman
called Homer Hoyt, who

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.400
during the Depression
years in Washington

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:30.560
did nothing else, without
a computer, calculated rent

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.590
payments in cities
in the United States,

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:35.405
particularly in Chicago.

00:42:35.405 --> 00:42:37.400
He'd written a
book about Chicago,

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:41.810
from which he developed
an alternative model

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:43.310
to the concentric model.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:47.300
That is, he claims that the
city is really patterned

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.000
on the basis of sectors.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:58.250
Sectors allow people to move
towards higher income areas,

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:02.690
towards open space, towards
mountains, towards higher

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:07.070
natural phenomenon.

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:12.920
And therefore, you get
a division of people,

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:19.460
rather than occupying space
concentrically, occupying space

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.170
through wedges.

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:24.680
Now, if you look at
the diagram of Atlanta,

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:29.270
you'll see some justice
for his phenomenon.

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:31.970
It applies equally
well to Johannesburg.

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:34.910
And when I do a case study
with you of Johannesburg,

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:39.440
you will see how the sector
theory worked very well

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.110
up to a certain point
in the construction,

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:46.100
of the organization,
of the city.

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:57.520
In the case of Atlanta, you
have, as I've said before,

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:07.020
the phenomenon here
based on rent payments,

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.450
justifying the Hoyt model.

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:23.100
The Chicago school took place
in the great city of Chicago.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:26.670
Chicago has been
called the Shock City

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:29.550
because of its rapid emergence.

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:35.610
Chicago didn't exist
in 1830, and in 1893,

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:38.910
at the time of the
Chicago World's Fair,

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:43.890
125th of all the world's
railroads passed Chicago.

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:45.420
It's the most rapidly--

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.930
and by virtue of its
rapid growth, which

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:58.230
wasn't accompanied by
government, or good government,

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:02.040
you have a phenomenon, which
I'll look into more carefully

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.280
when we discuss the
case of Chicago.

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:13.110
Chicago is the most phenomenal
19th century city of all.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:18.540
And it's interesting
that Chicago

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:21.690
is the place where the
first academic study

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:24.680
of the social grouping of
cities should take place.

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:31.230
A lot of things happened for
the first time in Chicago.

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:41.880
Economics has paid a
serious but very scant

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.070
interest in location.

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:48.900
As Paul Krugman points
out, the new textbook

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:54.360
by Joseph Stiglitz at Harvard,
which is 1,000 pages in length,

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:57.240
has the word "city"
mentioned once

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:01.410
and the word "location"
mentioned once.

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:05.640
If you want to read about
it, read Krugman's views

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.300
on why economics has
not included location

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.340
as a serious input.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:16.400
Read the pieces that
I've suggested you read.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:22.710
There are two pieces
by Krugman explaining

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:29.250
why modern economics
after Marshall

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:33.870
managed very well on
optimization theories

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:39.000
without including the cost
of transportation or the cost

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.810
and benefits of location.

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:46.300
He claims there's been a
weakness in economic geography,

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:51.240
which has tried to measure up
to the purity of economics,

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:55.020
of modern economics,
and gives some

00:46:55.020 --> 00:47:01.350
suggestions for maybe
a new post-real estate

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:03.670
study of location.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:10.680
The classic allocation
models are still, number one,

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.130
at the regional level.

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:19.410
The work of von Thunen,
the German agronomist,

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.650
who argued that the
cost of transportation

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:26.520
was a phenomenon in
allocating land use.

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:47.830
He claims that, as I've said
before, around a center,

00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:50.500
the spatial
distribution of crops

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.740
occurs according to
the yield per unit

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.795
area around a central town.

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:03.880
You end up with
dairy in the center,

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:09.820
orchards in the next ring,
grain in the next ring,

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:13.000
cattle in the next ring,
and forestry furthest

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.800
from the center.

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.230
This is not only a
function of land values,

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:20.470
but a function of the
cost of transporting goods

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:21.120
to the center.

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:28.840
Southern Germany, where von
Thunen, and Christaller,

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.290
and people like that,
economic geographers' work

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:34.690
was essentially flat.

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:41.140
And with population growth
occurring at a very low rate,

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:46.030
the notion of a single-centered
city or a distributed pattern

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:49.480
of cities at regular
intervals was appropriate.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:59.860
Christaller based his
economic geography on the idea

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:05.470
that they were central
places, and you

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:10.450
can see this phenomenon
in Northern Italy today.

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:19.550
If you move eastward from Milan,
30 miles from Milan is Brescia.

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:22.960
30 miles from Brescia is Verona.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:27.220
Vicenza is 30 miles from Verona.

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:32.620
Pádova is 30 miles, and Venice
at the end of this horizontal

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.310
east-west axis.

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:40.750
If you go from
Milano to Bologna,

00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:45.400
you have 30 miles to Pavia,
then 30 miles to Parma,

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.970
30 miles to Reggio,
30 miles to Moderna,

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:51.370
and 30 miles to Bologna.

00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:55.480
On the axis from Bologna in
the big triangle to Venice,

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.960
[INAUDIBLE] Ferrara, which is
about 30 miles from Bologna,

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.510
and then historical
land patterns

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:04.150
didn't allow this
phenomenon to take place.

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:17.490
There was a big exhibition
in Italy entitled,

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:21.310
"The Culture of 999 Cities."

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:24.690
What is interesting about
Christaller's interpretation

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:30.690
for contemporary times is
that a place like Moderna

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:34.440
produces the headquarters
of Lamborghini, Ferrari,

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:39.990
and Maserati and still is a
relatively small population

00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.630
center.

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:44.520
If you go to
Cortona, near Arezzo,

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:49.170
it has a bunch of things.

00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:52.740
Almost every small
town has a center

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:56.740
and a condition of uniqueness.

00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:00.300
The genius of the
Italian landscape

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:04.113
is in not developing--

00:51:04.113 --> 00:51:06.120
well, so they argue.

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:07.710
They haven't developed
large cities.

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:11.520
Milano is not a village,
but the Italians

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:15.480
are free to interpret
things very freely.

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:21.030
But the genius of being able to
be small, and yet to be unique,

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:23.340
and to--

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:28.830
I was asked to come
to Ferrara once,

00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:34.020
because they started a
new school of architecture

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:35.940
run by a friend of mine.

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:40.770
And the city was going
to give them a building,

00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:43.710
and they wanted this
small group of people

00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:45.660
to choose the building.

00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:48.990
They took us to
a building, which

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:53.820
they had given to
the man who developed

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:57.150
the first electronic
system for the movies,

00:51:57.150 --> 00:52:01.470
and it made a film which was
very popular at the time,

00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:06.210
possible prior to all
of this computer stuff.

00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:09.270
There was a sense in
this town that there

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:16.110
was an appreciation of its
capacity to be located locally.

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:19.300
You bought food from
the shop on the corner,

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:22.230
but yet it had an
international aspiration.

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:24.870
And put together,
all of these places

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:27.705
constituted the
Italian urban culture.

00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:36.860
It's a strange phenomenon,
but it's the phenomenon

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:38.640
which is worth noticing.

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:42.800
And it's a phenomenon
which organizes

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.590
the city and the country
in a different way

00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:49.640
than the very large city and the
very large spatial hinterland.

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:56.210
It's worth talking about as
we develop this class a bit

00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:59.750
further, but it emanates
from Christaller's work--

00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:08.040
C-H-R-I-S-T-A-L-L-E-R.

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:12.960
The third application of
the classical economic model

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:19.560
is in the distribution of
activities in the center,

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:25.430
in the central city itself.

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:28.440
Here you will have
the phenomenon,

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.860
which seems very crude
still at the moment,

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:35.910
that they are two variables.

00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:38.250
The one is the amount
of rent, the money

00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:41.880
you want to pay in
rent at one access,

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:45.450
and another axis which
says the distance that you

00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:47.400
can be from the center.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:51.390
The argument being, that in the
center, you pay higher rates,

00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:54.750
and the further out you
go, the lower rent you pay.

00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:58.390
But you have to pay the
increased transportation costs.

00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:04.620
So that balance will
produce suburban and then

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:08.430
exurban locations,
depending on the improvement

00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:11.490
of the transportation
system outwards.

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:16.290
That you'll get
movements of people

00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:23.850
as they classically make
more income from the center

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:25.290
outwards.

00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:31.320
And this is the
working class people

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:36.900
in this graph come in the former
curve in the center, where they

00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:41.790
balance minimal costs
of transportation

00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:45.660
and public transportation
with low, medium rents,

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:47.310
and so on, and so on.

00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:51.165
[INAUDIBLE] is here at MIT and
the father of regional science.

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:58.650
He's one of the
formulators of this theory.

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:02.460
Alonso at Harvard
did versions of it--

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:04.065
Wingo, [INAUDIBLE] and others.

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.790
Let me just say a few words
about the others in this list.

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:37.460
There have been attempts to
modulate the former cities

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:43.520
by analogies to physics,
population potential being

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.020
the--

00:55:53.657 --> 00:55:55.260
let me get this correct.

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:56.890
I often make a mistake with--

00:56:00.976 --> 00:56:04.730
well, forget about it.

00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:07.040
We haven't got time to go
into the great difference

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:11.180
between the population
potential moral, gravity

00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:14.630
models, communications,
networks, and topology.

00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:18.470
I should add to that
more current work

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:25.220
in fractal and
chaos theory, which

00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:30.500
if you want to read about
fractals, read [INAUDIBLE]..

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:35.630
But I estimate
these as having less

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:42.080
of a life in determining current
practice in urbanism than any

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:42.840
of the others.

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:44.750
They're somewhat academic.

00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:50.750
Gravity models, Forester's
urban systems, all of these form

00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:57.410
an attempt to use
notions of proximity,

00:56:57.410 --> 00:57:03.800
not notions of income, to
locate shopping centers,

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:08.240
to make modifications
to the American city.

00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:17.540
The question of decisions,
linked decisions,

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:20.300
again, here we have to
look at the work of people

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:23.660
like Forester, who claims that--

00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:27.140
we'll see the same phenomenon
in the work of John [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:29.690
on Tuesday.

00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:35.990
John [INAUDIBLE] claim is
that the built world is really

00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:39.110
the outcome of
agreements that are

00:57:39.110 --> 00:57:41.910
made between different people.

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:45.620
There is no city but
the one that rests on

00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:49.370
made agreements, and
tries to determine

00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:53.270
from made agreements what could
be the form of a city which

00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:55.220
takes that into account.

00:57:55.220 --> 00:58:04.730
Jay Forester argues that social
systems are currently complex,

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:09.380
and single answers are not
predictable or should not

00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:10.340
be expected.

00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:16.100
Urban systems are
based on information

00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:21.110
about the important decisions
that largely businessmen

00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:24.080
make in the American city.

00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:26.390
He hasn't asked
anybody or studied

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:29.030
data of any significance.

00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:34.570
He comes to simplistic
resolutions,

00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:39.680
that the more the economy
grows, the more poor people

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:42.150
you will have, and
things of this kind.

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:49.010
And I'm not doing him
justice in one sentence.

00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:52.220
Then the arena of conflict,
which is really quite

00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:54.410
an interesting phenomenon.

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:00.380
Much of the models
that I've gone through

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:04.910
have assumed that the city
is composed of benign people

00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:08.150
making benign agreements
amongst each other.

00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:14.470
Park and Burgess's model
of concentric circles

00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:18.490
means that it all, like
a plant, takes place

00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:24.610
without the plant having any
items of conflict or conflict

00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:26.410
as a phenomenon.

00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:30.160
Whereas, in fact,
for many centuries,

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.430
the resolution of conflicts
through the building of walls

00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:36.550
was a fundamental
aspect of city form.

00:59:36.550 --> 00:59:43.035
[INAUDIBLE],, at the end
of the 17th century,

00:59:43.035 --> 00:59:47.290
or the beginning of
the 18th century,

00:59:47.290 --> 00:59:51.580
could design a town which
could not be penetrated.

00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:54.220
So his reputation was--

00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:59.680
Blondell taught fortification
to architecture students

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.455
at the academy in Paris.

01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:09.460
The people who have
taken up conflict

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:12.220
really exist on the left.

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:16.150
There's David Gordon, who
explains American suburbia

01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:20.350
by the movement of
bosses to get away

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:23.830
from workers in labor strife.

01:00:23.830 --> 01:00:29.020
You get Manual Castells in
his pre-communication theory

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:35.200
mode, who is a young
Spanish Marxist who

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:38.560
wrote something called The
Wild City, in which he claims

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:43.720
that suburbanisation is the
function of surplus commodities

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:47.980
rather than of any
other form of economy.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:01.110
David Harvey, arguing
that it's very difficult

01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:06.000
to produce social
equity under capitalism,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.790
because there will
always be obstacles

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:12.540
in the way of maximizing
return on capital.

01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:26.140
Lefebvre, the French sociologist
who ran a journal called

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:26.860
[FRENCH]--

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:33.860
I was the editor
of [NON-ENGLISH],,

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:37.130
Space and Society, which was--

01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:41.765
I was part editor, following
Lefebvre's example.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.960
All of these are looking at
the way in which conflict

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.860
can be assumed and
resolved as part

01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:56.260
of the real existence of a city.

01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:04.060
Giancarlo De Carlo,
Italian architect,

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:11.410
used to argue that one
of the functions of--

01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:14.890
one of the ways of
displaying conflict

01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:20.200
was to allow
architecture to build

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:23.680
in its appropriate
fashion, but to depict

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.340
the elements of conflict
that are available,

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:31.630
and to heighten the sense
of conflicts in a city,

01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:35.740
but also to make it possible,
in a kind of anarchic sense,

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:39.460
for that city's
resolutions to be

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:44.760
made within a framework
of understood conflict--

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:49.000
resolvable conflict,
not revolution.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:56.330
So these attempts
at plans sometimes

01:02:56.330 --> 01:03:00.090
manifest this, or at least.

01:03:00.090 --> 01:03:03.240
If you look at the
workers' housing in Terni,

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:08.940
for instance, you can see
elements of this proposition,

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:12.330
but it's very vague,
and very generalized,

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:15.510
and not really a
powerful theory.

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.940
The Marxists have
not produced cities

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:29.280
which have externalized the
conflict notions which they

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.665
examined in the [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:31.665 --> 01:03:35.010
Their cities are much like
any city in the world.

01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:38.400
And Chinese Marxism
is certainly not

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:41.190
producing very much
from which we can

01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:44.295
learn about new city growth.

01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:51.870
So this particular
theory is waiting too.

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:54.650
Most of these theories--

01:03:54.650 --> 01:04:00.590
let me just end off at
once with this piece

01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:06.560
I gave you on the physics of--

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:08.960
JULIAN BEINART: Hmm?

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.810
AUDIENCE: The work
of [INAUDIBLE]??

01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:11.890
JULIAN BEINART: Yes.

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:12.880
Do you know his work?

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:13.690
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:17.120
JULIAN BEINART: What
do you think of it?

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.806
AUDIENCE: I think it brings
in an interesting perspective

01:04:20.806 --> 01:04:26.860
of all these findings on the
efficiency of [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:30.350
innovation of investment
versus how the population grows

01:04:30.350 --> 01:04:35.876
at the same time the per
capita wealth it generates.

01:04:35.876 --> 01:04:41.993
But it seems to be a
bit reductionist to me.

01:04:41.993 --> 01:04:43.535
JULIAN BEINART: You
know, it starts--

01:04:43.535 --> 01:04:45.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
universal model.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:48.850
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah,
it starts separating out

01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:54.340
what optimizes the
functioning of a city in terms

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:58.420
of transportation,
land use, crime,

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:02.360
and so on, which are important
components to understand.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:07.540
But he doesn't accept the
city as an environment which

01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:12.190
has speciality, or experience,
or any of the things

01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:15.430
that art history--

01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:18.070
I'm beginning to think more
and more, that in order

01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:22.150
to understand urbanism, you
need to study art history

01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:26.380
and perhaps forget
about all of this stuff.

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:36.010
But we all know that
every city is unique.

01:05:36.010 --> 01:05:40.350
That's all we talk about
when we talk about cities.

01:05:40.350 --> 01:05:43.830
But focusing on those
differences misses the point.

01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:45.270
Sure, there are differences.

01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:46.740
But different from what?

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:49.770
We found the what.

01:05:49.770 --> 01:05:53.250
There's an arrogance
about the security

01:05:53.250 --> 01:06:01.050
of physics as applied to complex
phenomena, such as a city.

01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:05.910
It may be that this is a
new generation of thinking.

01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:08.700
I mean, they're doing it
at Oxford, and Santa Fe,

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:12.120
and there are more and more
groups of complex theorists

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.430
emerging.

01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:15.630
I have my doubts.

01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:18.210
I'll be too old to see
any of this anyway.

01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:21.630
So I leave it to you.

01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:25.500
On Tuesday, we will look
at, for the last time,

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:30.540
in Part 1 of the subject,
at four or five theories

01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:33.480
of architects, contemporary
architects, who

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:36.060
are recently
deceased architects,

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:44.010
who've made attempts, such as
Space Syntax, so on, and so on.

01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:48.960
And then start from scratch
with the Industrial Revolution

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:53.750
and see what we can learn by
looking carefully at phenomena.
