00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.030
PROFESSOR: So now that we've
done a very simple calculation

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.850
of C of t, the
concentration of virions

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.300
in the air per volume,
which is coming

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.970
from just a mass balance
in a well-mixed room,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.400
let's zoom in, now, and
think about transmission

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.140
between the infected person,
or an infected person

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.920
and then a susceptible person
who is not yet infected.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.630
And the transmission
is occurring

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.960
by breathing the
infected droplets in,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.270
and then the virus has to
get out of those droplets

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.400
and interact with
the host tissues.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:56.910
So if we let beta be
the transmission rate,

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.290
so this is basically
new infection per time,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.250
so basically, it's the rate
at which another person may

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.789
become infected.

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.500
Then how will we write this?

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.680
Well, we could write it as--

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.870
so we're, now, forgetting
about the infected person.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.400
We care about their
breathing only

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.160
because it's producing this
concentration C that we just

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.800
talked about.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.100
But now we're going to focus
on the susceptible person.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.160
The susceptible person is now
breathing in at the same flow

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.789
rate Qb because the breathing in
and breathing out are the same.

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.190
And so Qb is the volume
per time around, let's say,

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.900
0.5 meters cubed per hour with
which they're sampling the air.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.560
And the air comes
in, and then C of t

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.020
is the concentration
of virions per volume.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.220
So this combination now tells
me how many virions per time

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.539
they're actually taking in.

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.360
There'll be a quantity Ci, which
we mentioned earlier, which

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.860
is the infectivity, and
that's the probability

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.600
that an individual
virion actually

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.450
causes this person to
get sick and to become

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.009
infected themselves.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.360
So this is the infectivity
of an individual virion.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.530
And then on top of that,
we also want to put in--

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.820
I'll just change the
color to highlight it--

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.380
the mask factor that we
talked about earlier.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.930
So that's the transmission
or penetration probability

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.630
for the droplets of
interest through the mask.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.940
These quantities, many of
them will depend on size,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.220
and we'll come to that,
size of the droplet,

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.290
but just as a rough
approximation,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.280
this is the starting point.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.970
So this is the number of,
basically, new infections

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.500
per time, and there
is a useful notion

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.579
in epidemiology, which is
that of the infection quantum.

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.370
So transmission rates
are often written

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:03.280
as infection quanta
per time, and that

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.110
is the rate at which a
person, which is susceptible,

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.150
will get infected.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.830
What we have not yet
captured is if you

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.620
have a finite number
of people in the room,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.090
when someone gets infected,
they can't get infected again.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.960
So the numbers of susceptible
people is changing.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.050
So we have to model the
progression of the disease

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.060
in the room, which
we have not done yet.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.329
So that's why the beta is not
the number of infected people

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.570
cause eventually you run
out of people to infect.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.920
So we have to account
for that later.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.350
But a useful way
to think of it is

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.079
that beta is sort of the rate
at which this person is sending

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.400
infection quanta over here.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.480
Those quanta may not
actually lead to an infection

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.610
because they might already
have been infected.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.610
But if they're
susceptible, that tells you

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.060
the rate at which that
person would become infected.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.180
So that's the notion
of infection quanta

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.560
is essentially defined by
the transmission rate beta.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.690
Now, this infectivity is
something we'll come back to.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.040
We will actually go through
the calculation for SARS-CoV-2,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.590
but it's been estimated
before to be at about 2%

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.530
from the original
SARS virus in 2003.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.140
And in fact, I will argue
that it's greater than 10%

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.690
for SARS-CoV-2.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.700
And we'll do that by analyzing
spreading data with the model.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.530
And, of course, that
helps to explain

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.160
why SARS-CoV-2 has led
to the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.140
and SARS-CoV-1 was not
able to spread as much.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.650
So now we have here
our transmission rate.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.150
And we can ask ourselves, this
is a transmission rate, which

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.760
is time-dependent,
but what if now

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.760
we calculate the steady-state
transmission rate?

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.440
So the transient would be
when the infected person first

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.370
enters the room.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.920
The concentration is
changing in time in the air,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.420
but eventually, there's kind
of a steady-state where there's

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.930
a balance of the production
and then the flow rate

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.840
through the room of refreshing
the air with outdoor air.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.500
And in steady-state, we
have the transmission rate

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.000
is going to go to
a constant value,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.210
which I'll call
beta bar, and that

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.740
is given by the
steady-state concentrations.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.130
So here I'll just write it--

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.570
I'll rewrite this expression
here Qb Ci Pm and then

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:30.030
the steady-state C, which is
the production rate P divided

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.650
by the outdoor airflow rate Q.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.740
And another way we
can write that is

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.320
that remember Q we can
write as lambda a times

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.480
V. So this is Qb, and in
fact, let me-- well, here,

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.650
I'll write it one more time.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:54.110
That's my Ci Pm capital
P over lambda A V.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.180
Now, recall that the
P we had written as,

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.420
that's the production
rate, also depends

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.700
on Qb, that's the rate at which
the infected person is exhaling

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.870
infected air.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.160
So that was Qb times nd, the
number of droplets per volume,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.610
Vd, the volume of
liquid in a droplet,

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.860
so this nd Vd's the
volume fraction of liquid.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.330
And then we needed Cv, which
was the concentration of virions

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.640
in the liquid or in the fluid.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.940
And there's also a factor
of Pm if that person

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.620
is wearing a mask.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.320
So we put all this together, we
get an important result here,

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.640
which is that the steady-state
transmission rate can

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:46.310
be written, when I plug-in here,
as Qb squared times Pm squared.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.550
So the mask factor
comes in twice

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:54.909
because if they are wearing
masks, there's two masks.

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:57.090
You have a mask at the source.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.210
You also mask at the
target, and the fluid

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.800
has to go through
both of those filters.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.070
So that's one reason, as
we'll see, that masks can be,

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.930
actually, very effective.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.060
And then we'll lump all
the parameters in something

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.250
I'll call Cq, which
I'll come back to,

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.620
and then we'll leave lambda
a V in the denominator.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.800
So this is the main
transmission rate

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.400
where I've defined this
important parameter Cq which

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.540
has all the information
about the specific disease,

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.180
and what is it?

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.380
It's everything else is left.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.560
It's nd Vd, so that has
to do with respiration,

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.380
so the distribution
of droplet sizes

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.090
and the size of the
droplets is something

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.909
that's coming from the
type of respiration

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:40.280
that the infected
person is engaging in.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.140
Cv is their viral
load, so it has

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.940
to do with the progression
of their disease

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.180
and how many viruses
or virions are found.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.550
And then we have Ci,
which is this infectivity,

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.430
the probability that
any one of those virions

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.440
will actually infect
this susceptible person

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.360
if it manages to get in
there and diffuse out

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.020
of the droplets.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.720
So coming back to this
notion of infection quanta,

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.720
while beta is an infection
quanta per time, which

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.860
are being kind of transmitted
from one infected person to one

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.450
susceptible person, the
way I've written it here

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:21.600
is I've reexpressed it as
infection quanta per volume

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.830
of air exhaled.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:32.580
So while C is the concentration
of virions in the background,

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.940
there is this Cq, which is
essentially the infection

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.809
quanta that are being released,
and the factor of CvCi

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:41.750
is actually what
connects those two.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:47.520
In fact, sometimes we
write Cq little cq CvCi,

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:56.710
this is infection quanta
per liquid volume in a drop.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.930
So from the mucus or material
that's being released,

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:02.530
there is a certain concentration
of infection quanta, which

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:06.020
is the physical concentration
of the virions Cv

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.660
times the probability
that if they

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.410
were to be exposed to the
susceptible person's cells,

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.210
that they would actually
infect those cells

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.950
and cause a transmission
of the infection.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.100
So that's another
important quantity,

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.420
and this here is really
the primary sort of lumped

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.410
or combined disease
and physiological

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.160
parameter in the model.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.340
So what's nice about
separating this way is

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.820
that Qb is something which has
to do with people's activity,

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.620
it's how fast they're
breathing, and that's

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.820
something we know very easily
whether they're at rest

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.220
or they're exercising.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.780
Pm is also known if we know
the kinds of masks people

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.280
are wearing.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.230
There's various studies
of transmission factors

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.410
and filtration
efficiencies of masks.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.860
And so we can put
reasonable estimates there.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.320
And then here we
see the importance

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.500
of lambda a, which is
the air exchange rate.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.460
So how quickly is fresh
air coming in the room?

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.350
That's a physical
parameter of the room, has

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:58.700
nothing to do with the disease.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.700
And V, of course, is a
geometrical parameter,

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.940
the room, which is the volume.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.080
And so all the disease aspects
are kind of lumped into the Cq.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:11.120
So if I want to apply this to
actual spreading of COVID-19,

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.740
I have all these
parameters that I

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.930
know that come from
the physics and fluid

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.740
mechanics of the room.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.410
And then, I have a
single parameter Cq
