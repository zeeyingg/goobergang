00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.960
PROFESSOR: So when we start
considering short-range effects

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.750
of respiratory
jets and plumes, it

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.580
raises the interesting
question of what

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.860
is the role of social
distancing, which

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.480
is our primary
means for fighting

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.940
the pandemic at the moment.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.480
So as we've discussed, this
is especially important

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.550
when masks or face
shields are not worn,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.050
so that the jets and plumes
that come from breathing

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.840
and speaking and singing and
other respiratory activities

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.180
are not blocked, in the sense
that the momentum is not

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.960
blocked.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.250
And furthermore, there's
no filtering going on.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.790
So then we have our
long-range airborne risk

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.460
coming from respiratory
aerosols that have become well

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.380
mixed into the background air.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.850
But we have a new
term that comes

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.590
from short-range transmission.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.470
And in a worst case
scenario, we can imagine that

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.520
as a wedge-like or
cone-like plume,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.900
which we have just described.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.160
In reality, there is going
to be some background

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.650
flows in the room,
which will sweep

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.700
that jet in different
directions and break it up.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.220
There'll be motion of
people, turning of heads.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.840
So it'll never be this simple.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.940
But the worst case
scenario is really

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.940
a well-formed respiratory
jet and somebody

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.940
essentially standing right in
it at a certain distance, X bar,

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.510
which is our sort of
average social distance.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.970
As we've discussed, we can also
take the ratio of these two

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.180
terms and speak of fs,
which we define here

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.360
as the short-range risk
enhancement factor.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.300
So that comes down
to two new parameters

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.509
which we've been discussing--

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.660
P jet, the probability
that a susceptible person

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.870
is in the respiratory jet
of an infected person,

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.400
and X bar, the typical distance
over which that occurs.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.640
Xc is this transition distance,
where the respiratory jet

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.300
concentration starts to match
that of the background ambient

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.870
air, which we substitute and
form this expression shown

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.540
here.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.600
So there are a
number of situations

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.420
we can think of to estimate
what would be these parameters.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.310
So the first would be just
to consider random occupant

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.350
placement.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.030
So in this situation, if we view
from above, we have, let's say,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.000
a person.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.880
This is now viewing from above.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.540
And they have a respiratory
jet, which is going off

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.850
like this in one direction.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.590
And then at any
given distance, we

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.460
can imagine there's sort of a
typical social distance here.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.010
Now, I'm kind of exaggerating
how far that is compared

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.720
to the size of the head.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.860
But if this distance here is
X bar, then at that distance,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.690
we'd like to say, what
is the probability

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.440
that the susceptible
person is in the jet?

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.300
And that would simply
be formed by taking

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.720
the angle of the jet
relative to the full circle.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.560
So we could imagine,
what is the probability

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.520
of putting a person right here
versus over here or over here

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.440
where they're not
going to be in the jet?

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.790
So in that situation,
we could write

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.280
that P jet is approximately
the inverse tangent of alpha.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.970
So alpha, remember,
is the ratio--

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.160
is the entrainment factor.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:42.170
And it's sort of the slope of
this line defining the cone

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.060
of the respiratory jet.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.540
And then we can
divide that by pi.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.290
So that basically tells
us the probability

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.240
of being in this yellow
region versus somewhere

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.130
else at a given distance.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.490
And then, now, if we think
about the distance factor--

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.790
if it's completely
random, then if we just

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.620
imagine lots of people
scattered throughout a room--

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.310
imagine a busy
space, for example,

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.400
in a bar or a nightclub, a place
where it's somewhat crowded

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.040
but people are kind
of moving around.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.220
Then we might have an average
social distance, which

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.700
is the area of the
room divided by N.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.060
So that's the area per person.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.230
And then take a square root.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.480
That's an estimate
of the distance.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.580
And the square root of area
is the length L of the room.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.180
So it's divided by
square root of N.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.820
And so with these
two assumptions,

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.070
we would then find that this
short-range risk enhancement

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.990
factor--

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.060
well, what does it look like?

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:45.940
It then is this factor P
jet times Xc over L times--

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.240
and then we have this
N minus 1 factor.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.220
So if N is larger than 1,
we could just estimate that

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.670
as a square root of N. So what
that shows is as more and more

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.280
people pack into the
room, we have an increase

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.020
in the importance of long-range
versus short-range transmission.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.250
And this pre-factor here is
something which typically

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.400
will be much less than 1,
because the probability

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.380
of being in a jet-- if
alpha is around 0.1, 0.15,

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.720
this turns out to be around 3%.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.410
OK, so that's-- it's not quite
as wide as I've sketched here.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.500
The jet is a little
bit more narrow.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.680
And we've already discussed
that Xc-- the distance where

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.300
the concentration
in the jet starts

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.890
to match that of the
ambient-- it does

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.450
depend on the
conditions of the room

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.770
and the ventilation
and other factors.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.580
But roughly speaking,
Xc is typically smaller

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.210
than the size of the room.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.780
And so this factor here is
quite a bit less than 1.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.230
So you see that in
a random situation,

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.120
the short-range transmission
starts to become important only

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.230
when the number of
people becomes large.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.690
And it grows like
square root of N.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.720
And there's a certain point,
which might be at N equals 20

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.940
or N equals 50 or N
equals 100, depending

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.330
on the space, where
the short-range risk is

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.670
larger than the risk
of the background

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.950
airborne transmission.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.290
And that's, again, just
coming from random placement.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.440
So on the other hand, the
random placement situation

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.930
is not quite the
best case scenario.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.150
But it's sort of a fairly
optimistic scenario.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.100
The best case scenario
is if people are always

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.480
kind of having their
backs to each other,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.770
never breathing on each other.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:24.850
That never really happens.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.700
In fact, it's more typical in
human interactions for people

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.610
to face each other.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.340
They may be talking to each
other, looking at each other.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.050
And so hence, we tend to
find ourselves more typically

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.630
in the way of breathing.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.690
And so it might be better
to think about this estimate

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.040
in other ways.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.420
So a second way
that we can think

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.659
about it is by using
a social distance

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:51.800
guideline, or a social
distancing rule, let's

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.300
just say.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.510
So let's say that instead
of a random situation

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.270
where people are keeping
sort of the average distance

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.250
between each other,
that no matter

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.430
how many people in the room up
to a certain maximum occupancy,

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.410
they're not going to
come within, let's

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.340
say, a 6-foot radius or a
3-foot radius, 1-meter radius.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.490
Depending on what the
social distancing guideline

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.170
is in that region,
there's going to be

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.390
a certain sort of minimum X.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.730
And let's just think of that
as the worst case scenario.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.060
For the people that are that
close to each other, that's

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.450
the distance we'll choose.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.340
And so this might be something
like 6 feet, 1 meter.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.950
You can pick.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:37.060
And in that case, the
fs is P jet over N

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.620
minus 1 times Xc over
X. And we've already

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.110
estimated that at
6 feet, Xc over X,

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.260
it does depend on the
ventilation and the size

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.250
of the room and other factors.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.610
But we've already said
that this factor here

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.940
might be something like 6 to 600
for a certain set of examples

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.409
that we've just considered.

00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:58.810
So when we put
all this together,

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.150
if we take into account
also that P jet is around,

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.410
let's say, 3%--

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.670
if we imagine having
random placement of people

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:11.320
but at a fixed distance,
minimum distance, of 6 feet,

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.820
then what we'll
find is this ends up

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:18.110
being something like 0.2
over N ranging up to,

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:23.300
let's say, 20 over N. And
again, this is just very rough.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.970
So this is with random angle.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.770
So in other words,
we're still thinking now

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.100
of just this kind of random
orientation of somebody's head,

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.960
not necessarily facing
one person all the time.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.470
And so you can see
here that if N is--

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.870
if we're in the situation of
the 20, which is-- by the way,

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.750
that's the case where
this is getting large.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:50.550
So that would be a
case of a large room.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:56.540
Or it would be of low
breathing rates, et cetera.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.830
Then we-- you can see
that when N gets--

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:06.900
if N is small, then this number
can actually be quite large.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.610
So in other words, if we just
have a few people in the room,

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.400
and they can get this
close to each other--

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.140
like one minimum social
distance, like 6 feet--

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.990
then the primary risk is coming
from airborne transmission,

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.630
especially if the
room is very big.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:23.470
If two people are by
themselves in an enormous room,

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.410
then the risk from background
airborne transmission

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.800
is minimal compared to the
risk of direct short-range

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.700
transmission.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.290
So that kind of
makes sense, right?

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:35.020
On the other hand,
notice the effect of N.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.970
If you have more and
more people in the room,

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.520
then even though most of those
people are a lot farther away,

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.010
there's so many of them
that are potentially

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:46.210
going to get infected
that it becomes worse,

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.690
even in the case
of 20 here, which

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:48.860
is sort of the more conser--

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.440
the case where short-range
is more important.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.720
It starts to switch to where the
long-range transmission becomes

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.400
more important when
N is larger than 20

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.610
in this particular example.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:07.310
So basically, so
significant for small N

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:12.320
and basically large V. So
basically, low-occupant

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.700
densities-- if people are
to come close to each other,

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.570
then it makes sense
short-range is important.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.680
In fact, a limit that we
haven't talked about yet

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.910
is, what if we're outside?

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.290
What if we don't
even have-- what

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.060
if the V goes to infinity
or V is very large,

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.490
so effectively it's infinity?

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.020
What this is telling
us is that we

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.720
have to stop worrying about
the long-range background

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.320
well-mixed concentration
of infectious aerosols.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.370
And instead, we have to
focus on the short range.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.210
Just whenever people are
coming close to each other,

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:37.870
make sure they're not
breathing directly

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.780
on each other for
long periods of time.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.790
That's the key.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.290
Now, the last thing
we can think of,

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.000
which is really kind of
like a worst case scenario--

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.250
that would be where a person is
at the closest distance that's

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.990
allowed or expected--

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.200
let's say, 6 feet, maybe
even 3 feet, 1 meter.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.630
And also, they're not
randomly placed and angled.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.340
But they're really
just constantly

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.300
in the jet of the other person.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.100
So let's say, for
example, P jet is 90%.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.290
That's a pretty high
number, keeping in mind

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.480
that there's also turbulent
and chaotic flows in the room,

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.140
such that even if you're
facing somebody all the time,

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.020
the stable respiratory
jet and puff

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.640
train is going to be swept
away by other currents.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.270
And so it's really not as though
the other person is constantly

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.530
going to be in--

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:25.280
fully exposed.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.830
But let's just say, we pick a
number like 90%, which is kind

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.850
of like a worst case scenario.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.270
And we're always
facing each other.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.710
So let's, again, pick--

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.410
X bar is, let's
just say, 6 feet.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.540
Let's just say,
maybe we're sitting

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.540
across a table at
a distance which

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.280
is sort of an acceptable
social distance

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.130
according to the 6-foot rule.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.640
Then we're going to find that
this enhancement factor is

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:56.900
around 6 over N to
600 over N. So we

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:05.720
can see that the short-range
effect can be a lot larger.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.770
So notice, even if N
gets to be really large,

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.650
like a lot of people in
the room-- let's say,

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.200
it's a restaurant with
100 people in the room--

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.230
still, it's 6 times worse
to be in a single person's

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:19.590
respiratory jet 90% of the
time at 6-foot distance.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.570
So that's actually
fairly alarming

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:26.360
if you think about situations
such as restaurants or office

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.450
meetings or any
other normal activity

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.870
where people are
facing each other

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.230
and breathing on each
other continuously

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.420
without wearing masks
or face shields.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.570
So this would be--

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:40.560
I'll just mention
here, short-range

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.900
dominates in this situation.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.050
So then, how do we
mitigate against

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.000
this short-range
transmission risk, which

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.120
is going to be worse, again,
when we have people that

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.830
are not wearing
masks or face shields

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.440
and are in close
proximity and facing

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.890
each other for long
periods of time,

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:03.050
and especially in a larger room
and a lower occupant density

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.540
where the N is maybe
not so big, and we

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.150
don't have to worry as much
about long-range transmission?

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.800
Well, one way to
proceed is to continue

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.470
using the universal
guideline that we've

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.150
derived right here
for long range,

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:18.630
and simply choose a small
epsilon, much less than 1.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.880
And you can see here, it
doesn't have to be that tiny.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:26.220
From this simple estimate
here, maybe an epsilon of 0.01

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.130
might not be so bad because,
see, this number 600 is there.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.010
And if N is maybe 5
or 10 in the room,

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.940
then that might be
already helping you.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.900
So remember, we use the
guideline with a fudge factor,

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.760
or a tolerance, epsilon.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.560
And some of the uncertainties in
different modes of transmission

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.120
are already kind of
included in there.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.870
But certainly, if we're
not wearing masks,

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.410
the risk is pretty high.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.150
And so that may not be enough.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:54.760
And that's why social
distancing can help.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.800
But I want to emphasize
from our discussion

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.960
of these respiratory
plumes, there's

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.840
nothing really that
special about 6 feet.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.460
There's unfortunately today a
feeling in the general public

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.880
that if you're
closer than 6 feet,

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.130
you're at extremely high risk.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.670
You've penetrated
somebody's bubble.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.590
But when you're a little
bit more than 6 feet,

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.340
you can breathe easy,
because you're safe.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.380
And you can see that's
really not true.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.280
If you are not wearing
masks, these respiratory jets

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.410
and plumes can travel
very long distances.

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.540
Of course, airborne
transmission is everywhere

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.100
in the room at any distance.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.040
But even the elevated risk
of short-range transmission

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.110
can extend further than 6 feet.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.570
On the other hand, when people
are turning their heads,

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.970
and there's sort of
convection in the room

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.000
and thermal convection as
we've been discussing, in fact,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.080
6 feet might be overkill.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.330
Maybe being even a little
bit closer might be OK.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.510
But the important thing is that
distance is not so special.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.430
And also, the details matter.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.890
So as you can see here, we can
get very different estimates

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.150
based on where the
occupants are placed,

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.400
how they're facing each
other, what kind of activities

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.620
they're engaging in,
what kind of movements.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.220
So there's really no
universal guideline.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.560
It makes more sense to start
from a universal guideline

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.010
for long-range transmission
and then enforce

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:08.470
mask use in situations where we
are worried about transmission,

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.930
rather than trying to guess
how people are going to behave

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.550
and what kind of
distance they're going

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.090
to keep not wearing masks.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:15.520
So the safest
thing is, if you're

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.010
worried about
coronavirus transmission,

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.510
just wear a mask,
indoors especially.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:25.230
So that brings us now to
thinking about summarizing

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.900
this entire chapter, going
beyond the well-mixed room,

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.450
where we've been discussing
the fluid mechanics

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:35.280
of indoor spaces and of human
occupants and respiration

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.360
within those spaces.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:42.240
So I think I'd like to leave
you with the picture of people

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.200
who are smoking in the room.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.190
So we're all familiar
with the situation

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.860
where you have a
room-- let's say,

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.890
could be a restaurant
or some other space

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.380
where there is,
let's say, a table

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.880
or a few tables,
where there's maybe

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.860
5 or 10 people in the room.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.830
And there's one person or
two people that are smoking.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.230
Now, we know that when
the person who's smoking

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.360
breathes in on the
cigarette and exhales,

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.300
there's a very dense plume
of smoke that comes out.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.630
It gets carried by thermal
currents and rises.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.720
And you know that if you
stand right in that space,

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.890
it will be a very significant
amount of smoke you're

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:18.930
going to have to breathe.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:20.940
In fact, it's courteous
for the person who's

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:24.520
smoking to [EXHALES] breathe
away and not breathe directly

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.520
in other people's faces.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.970
That would be sort of rude.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:30.240
And maybe, as we're thinking
about respiratory transmission

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.730
of viral disease, we should
think in the same way.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.230
Each person should
be worried about,

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.660
am I really breathing
directly on another person?

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.690
If I'm not wearing a mask, why
don't I breathe somewhere else?

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:42.240
But we also know
from our experience

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.700
with smoke-filled rooms
that there may only

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.020
be one or two people smoking.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.500
And you can occasionally see
these puffs or burst of smoke

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.530
when they're exhaling after
drawing on a cigarette.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.870
But if you look around
the rest of the time,

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.480
the smoke is kind
of swirling around.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.440
It's a little more
concentrated in some places.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.060
But you can see
very quickly, it's

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.010
uniformly spread
throughout the room.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.200
And somebody who is on
the far side of the room

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.380
is at essentially the same risk
as somebody who's very close--

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.050
even 6 feet or 3
feet away, whatever

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:12.060
that special distance may be--

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.599
because the air is
typically well mixed.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:17.700
And those smoke particles
end up throughout the room.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.310
And you're just as
much risk at 60 feet

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.500
as you are at 6 feet
under those circumstances.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:28.900
And so that's really the
main message of this course,

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.920
while we also keep in mind that
there are these sort of details

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.420
of short-range
transmission that I'd

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.700
like you to be aware
of when applying

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.820
the guideline for long-range
aerosol transmission.
