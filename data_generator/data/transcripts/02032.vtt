WEBVTT

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.030
PROFESSOR: And so now let's
consider the spreading

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.329
of infections, disease indoors.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.960
So the McKendrick-Kermack models
and various compartment models

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.710
that we just described start
from the assumption essentially

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.660
of a well-mixed
population, where there's

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.580
no spatial
dependence, no network

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.460
dependence of connectivity
of people with each other

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.890
but rather sort of everyone
is interacting with everyone

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.050
in some sort of average sense.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.940
So that philosophy
has also been brought

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.820
to bear on spreading
events indoors

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.720
where a little bit
stronger assumption is made

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.940
is that the transmission is
occurring through the air

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.360
and the air is well-mixed.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.600
So not only are the people
well-mixed in the sense

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.180
that they can interact
with each other regardless

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.150
of their distance apart or
anywhere placed in the room,

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.860
but the reason it's
a valid approximation

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.540
is because the air
itself is well-mixed.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.920
And so we've
already been talking

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.570
about the air, the
well-mixed air,

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.940
and we've calculated
transmission rate.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.990
Now let's start to connect
that to disease-spreading.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.710
So one concept there
would be to consider

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.950
that the initial number
of infected people, i0,

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:26.410
enters a room or an indoor
space with n persons,

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:34.229
including the infectors,
for a time, tau.

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.360
So we now have introduced
a finite timescale, which

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.610
is the time spent in the room.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.410
So you have a room.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.160
Some people are in it, and we're
imagining an infected person

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.320
comes in, and they spend
a certain amount of time,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.340
and then they leave.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.420
And during that time we'd like
to ask ourselves what happened

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.509
with all the other people.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.180
How many people were infected?

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.150
OK?

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.150
So this tau kind of acts like
the inverse of the removal

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:04.530
rate, but we also will
assume that gamma tau is

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.460
much less than 1.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.240
So if we think of gamma as the
recovery rate or the death rate

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.330
from the disease, so
that's the removal quantity

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.910
at the population
level, then we're

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.510
assuming the time spent in the
room is small compared to that.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.350
So in other words, while
you're in the room,

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.660
nobody is going to be
recovering or dying.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.910
We're just simply going to
be transmitting the disease

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.110
for a certain amount of time.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.079
So the r is gone.

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:40.420
On the other hand, we can also
consider an exposed compartment

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.579
of the population,
the group in the room.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.100
So the exposed group is
one which has essentially

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.560
been exposed to the
pathogen, so let's say

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.910
they've inhaled a critical
quantity of the virus,

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.520
but they have not yet become
themselves infectious.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.020
So they are already exposed.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.370
They are going to come
down with the disease.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.290
So they are going to be
eventually symptomatic

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.160
and potentially infectious, but
they may not be infectious yet.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:22.610
So the exposed group basically
has received the disease.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.360
So it's been transmitted
to them but is not yet

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.900
themselves infectious.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.610
So that's another sort of group
that we want to think about.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.140
So another way to say it,
they're not yet contagious.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.690
So they're going to get sick,
but they're not contagious yet.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.470
So I should put here
contagious is another word you

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.020
could think about using.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.130
So we've gotten rid of r,
the recovered compartment,

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.610
but we've added e.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.670
So instead of the SEIR
model, we have the SEI model.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.880
Now, where we can write
down the same kinds

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.020
of equations as before.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.770
ds dt is minus beta, and
I'll write beta of t,

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.580
si, because another
complexity here

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.220
is we know is that as soon as
the infected person comes in

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.779
if it's airborne
transmission, it takes time

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:19.660
through the fluid
mechanics that we were just

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.450
describing for the
concentration to build up.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.280
So the transmission
rate is not constant.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.300
We've actually
already calculated

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.850
that transmission rate, but
it now enters this equation.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.490
So this is now the susceptible
people are getting exposed.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.540
And so when that sort of
reaction happens, if you will,

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.090
the exposed
population then grows,

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.460
and then there's a
certain rate with which

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.580
exposed people can become
themselves infectious

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.170
to others.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.920
And that rate we'll call alpha.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.060
So we can remove exposed
people at a rate alpha,

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.800
and when they're removed
they become infected people.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.220
And so then the number
of infections grows.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.490
So this is a very
closely-related model

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.740
that we could solve.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.810
And in order to couple this
to airborne disease-spreading,

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.560
we need to go back to our
model of the airborne pathogen.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.540
So, for example, the virions per
air volume which we called c,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.860
and, in fact, I'll even
write this as a dc dt

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.820
with a partial derivative,
which is p, which depends

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.720
on the size, r, divided by--

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.740
actually this should be v--

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.460
minus lambda c of
rc, so that was

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.030
the model we just talked
about, which we have to solve.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:52.510
And then the beta of t
is the breathing rate

00:05:52.510 --> 00:06:00.220
times the integral over all
these sizes of c of r and t

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.840
and then ci, and of
course there could

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:09.280
be masks, which might also
be size dependent, dr.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.940
So we tie it together this way.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.640
This kind of model,
which is typically

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.830
run without accounting
for the size dependents,

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.930
but that has been done
by some authors as well,

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.650
generally falls under the
category of Wells-Riley models.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.430
And I mentioned here
that Wells actually

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.550
was a real pioneer here,
already starting in the 1930s.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.520
Did careful studies of
disease transmission,

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.240
including for flu and
other viral diseases,

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.150
and really was one of
the initial proponents

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.780
of the idea of infectious
air, that there are particles

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.120
suspended in the air which
can become infectious.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.800
He also was the
one who pioneered

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.440
the Wells curve, which explored
evaporation versus settling.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.170
And in 1955, he introduced
this kind of a model

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.760
where he was taking into account
the balance of the production

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.310
rate, p, and then the
ventilation rate in order

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.110
to describe the buildup of the
infectious droplets in the air.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:17.270
And then the transmission is
connected in this way here.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.330
And I should say that
in Wells-Riley modeling,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:27.710
usually e is ignored,
and so we normally just

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.480
go straight from s to i.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.190
So I'll say e is neglected,
and what that really

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:41.470
means is that the incubation
rate here, this alpha,

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.930
is the incubation rate.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.310
So it's the rate at which
an exposed person becomes

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.190
infectious or contagious.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.700
That alpha t is
much less than 1.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.040
So it's essentially
the Wells-Riley model,

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.440
it's the slow incubation limit.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.550
But we've written down
something more general here,

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.680
which does also allow for
the possibility of exposed

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.340
people that have not yet--

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.340
that could become infectious,
so we'll come back

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.360
to that in just a moment.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.870
So let's kind of
summarize the results

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.490
of the Wells-Riley approach.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:30.780
So we'll consider the slow
incubation limit, which

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:35.340
is alpha tau much less than 1.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.750
And so in that case, if
there's slow incubation,

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.820
during the time of the infected
person being in the room,

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.650
there is no time for new
people to become infectious.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.290
So it's really just
like a fixed source.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.460
So it's essentially
saying that i

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.490
is equal to i0,
which is a constant.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.790
So even though the disease
is being transmitted,

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.050
there is no kind of
amplification effect

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.790
because the people
who have been exposed

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.600
are not able to
themselves infect others

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.570
because the incubation
is too slow.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.870
And this model
here, where you sort

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:20.880
of couple these equations with
the si equations basically,

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:33.160
that was done by Gammaitoni
and Nucci in 1997.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.990
So you can see
starting from Wells,

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.450
we start to move towards this
picture of actually coupling

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:41.170
the dynamics of the pathogen
to the transmission.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.170
And there have been a
number of models since then

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.880
which have even taken
into account some

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.470
of these aspects of
the different drop

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.540
sizes and other
effects that we've

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.130
been discussing that were not
initially considered by Wells.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.930
So that's this.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.200
So the first thing to do
is to deal with beta of t.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.150
So how are we going to do that?

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.770
So if I put beta t
on the other side

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.190
here, if I kind
of divide it down,

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:07.780
you can see that I
really would like

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:13.840
to define a new differential
of a variable t hat, which

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.980
is beta of t times dt.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.370
That would be my definition
of a new variable.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.080
And so when i integrate
this, it tells me

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.180
that I should really
switch to a new time

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.390
variable, which is
not just t, but it's

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.900
the integral of beta dt.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.480
So it's a time-like variable.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.310
And once I do that I'm
essentially sweeping this guy

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.690
into the derivative there.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.700
And if I also assume that
i is roughly equal to i0,

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.910
then what I have now is a
much simpler equation here.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.030
I go from this
non-linear equation

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:48.790
with time-dependent
coefficients to something

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.920
which is now linear.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:11:01.120
And we have ds dt hat is
approximately equal to beta--

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:16.770
sorry-- which is minus i0s.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.540
So, again, our i is
roughly constant.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.940
Our beta got swept
into the time.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.650
So this is just kind of a
simple exponential relaxation.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:34.060
And the initial value is that s
at time equals 0 is n minus i0.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.800
So there are n people.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.920
i0 of them are the
initial infected ones.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.290
And so this a pretty
easy equation to solve.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.630
It's just an exponential
relaxation, which we've already

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.440
seen a few times before.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.080
And so the solution
is that s is n

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.710
minus i0, the
initial value of s,

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.030
times e to the minus i0t hat.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:03.560
So it's i0, integral
0 to t of beta dt.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:08.660
And then we can also write--

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.090
so that's the s,
and the e is just

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.720
if we have fast incubation--

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.770
or sorry, slow incubation,
this term is gone,

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.710
and we basically just
have e as sort of just--

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.500
s and e have to add
up to n basically.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:29.720
And so we're left with e of t
is n minus i and then 1 minus,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.020
and let me actually write
this quantity up here

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:45.340
as little q of t, where
little q of t is i0 times

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.010
the time integral of beta dt.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.020
And what is this q here?

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:04.630
This q can be thought of as
the number of infection quanta

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.570
per time that are
released by the infectors

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.970
because their i's are infectors.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.490
Each one of them is infecting
another individual person

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:15.920
at a rate beta, and that
beta is time-dependent,

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.260
so you have to
integrate in time.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.980
And so this is telling
me the total number

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:26.860
of people that would be infected
by those infected people

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.720
if you weren't running
into all of the limits that

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.890
are described by this model.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.670
So what is happening is that
if someone gets exposed,

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.680
they can't be exposed
again, so there's

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.270
some numbers there
that are changing,

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:41.220
so you can't keep passing an
infection quantum to somebody

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.930
and have them get
infected over and over.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.500
So that doesn't happen.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.500
But what this is measuring is
somehow the number of times

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.420
that somehow there's
been an attempted

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.000
infection or an
expected infection

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.640
if a person were susceptible.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:02.010
So this q of t here is
the infection quanta

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:12.260
as defined by Wells
transmitted in time t.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.750
So up to time t, there
are i0 infectors--

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.610
that number's not
changing-- and the way

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.860
you can think about this
kind of airborne transmission

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.520
is they're essentially
spewing out infection quanta.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.030
Each one of them if it hits a
potentially susceptible person

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.820
will infect them, but the
number of susceptible people

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.580
is changing.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.340
So it's not like you keep
getting more infections.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.450
Eventually you
run out of people,

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:33.860
and you can't keep
infecting them,

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.810
but that's one way
to think about this.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:39.240
And we've already
calculated this concept

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.870
of infection quanta in the
context of the breathing.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.360
We've defined a
quantity, which is

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.080
the number of infection quanta
per volume of exhaled breath.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.880
We've also talked about
the quanta emission

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.830
rates for people and connected
that back to the droplets.

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.100
And so here's how you see
how that quantity enters

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:59.490
into the
disease-spreading models.

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:03.060
And in fact, we can sketch
what happens with s and i here.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.680
So basically if we start
with s, for example, starts

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:12.690
at the value n minus i0 and
as you go in time it decays--

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:15.440
well, the decay
rate is basically

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.910
set by sort of the average beta.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.910
So this is kind of
like some kind of maybe

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.720
if you're getting
close to steady state,

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.860
then beta inverse is sort
of what this timescale is.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.100
But what's actually
happening is you cut it off

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.110
at a certain time, tau.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.060
So that's the time that
you're in the room.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.130
In that time, the number
of susceptible people

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:41.860
has gone down, and the number
of exposed people goes up.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.780
But then because the
incubation rate is slow,

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.640
the exposed people never become
infectious in this model.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.130
So the number of
infectors is fixed.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:55.160
And so since we
have slow incubation

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.960
and since the number
of infectors is fixed,

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.500
another way to look
at this is notice

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.530
this non-linear equation,
which had s times i,

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.210
it became i0 times s.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.640
So it became a linear response.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.860
And so another way to
think about this limit

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:11.340
is this is the limit
of linear response.

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.570
So the Wells-Riley
models are basically

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.540
linear response models,
which are typically

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:25.160
not taking into account a growth
in the number of infectors,

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.000
which would lead to
kind of an amplification

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.010
of disease-spreading in a room.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.130
And that's often justified
because the time someone

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.460
spends in a room is often times
a lot less than the incubation

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.560
time, which could be
on the order of days.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.290
People might only spend
a few hours in the room.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.170
On the other hand, there are
situations such as classrooms,

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:48.360
long-term care facilities and
homes, prisons, workplaces,

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.460
where people are exposed
to each other for days

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.020
or weeks or months actually.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.300
They may go home in between,
but there's a constant exposure.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.370
And so you may need to worry
about these other sorts

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:03.030
of dynamics, even in an
indoor setting actually.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.410
So we'll come back to that.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.500
Now another important
concept I'd like to get here

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.400
is what is the early
rate of infection.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.210
So this quantity here is q.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:16.290
I wrote n minus 1 here.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:17.040
That was the case.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.490
Actually more
generally this should

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.190
be n minus i0 because
often times we're

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.740
thinking of one infector,
so I kind of jumped to that,

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.339
but more generally
it'd be n minus i0,

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:28.050
And this quantity
here is also s0.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.660
That's the initial number
of susceptible people.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.060
So basically you take the
initial number of susceptible,

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.400
and they slowly
become exposed based

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.670
on how many quanta
they've consumed.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:44.400
Now, the definition
of quanta of infection

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.110
often is tied to this equation.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:53.920
This essentially is the Wells
equation, derived in 1955.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.240
And Wells actually
defined quanta from this.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.520
He said that one quantum
infection corresponds

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:05.590
to a probability of
transmission of 63%

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:10.960
because if you put q
equals minus 1, 1 minus e

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.930
to the minus 1 is 63%.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.270
So basically he said a quantum--

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:19.480
so if someone asks you what
is a quantum infection--

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:26.760
a quantum is basically
63% chance of infection.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.180
But the problem
with that thinking

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.620
though is that in some other
situation where there is maybe

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.960
incubation going on, I might
get more infected people.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.090
So I can't just count the
infected people in a room

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:41.560
and assume that I'm getting a
measure of infection quanta.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.680
Infection quanta actually
are defined by beta.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.300
That's an important thing.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.530
So really what is beta?

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.460
It's actually the rate of
infection quantum transfer

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.850
from infectious to susceptible.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:54.670
Sorry.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.080
It's si basically.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.120
Oh actually did I--

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.230
no, that's correct, yeah.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.700
So it's the rate of
basically becoming exposed.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:02.200
Excuse me.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.700
So it's from
susceptible to exposed.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.890
So that rate basically
defines beta,

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.790
and that is giving you the rate
of infection quanta transfer.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:12.460
How many people actually
get infected or exposed

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.140
involves solving
some set of equations

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.730
like this, which
might not be the same

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.170
as the Wells-Riley model.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:18.640
So that's an important
thing to keep in mind,

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.800
and we'll come back to that.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:26.930
So this is basically Wells'
definition of a quantum

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.270
is that basically there's
a 63% chance that it's

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.770
going to infect
somebody, but that's

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.110
completely tied to this
linear response exponential

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.840
relaxation.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.000
It's not really, I don't think,
is the appropriate definition.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.240
Now, another thing we can ask
is, what about at early times.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.380
And that would be the case where
the expected number of quanta

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.810
transferred is less than 1.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:56.380
So at early times you haven't
really seen a lot of infection

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.710
take place.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.230
This will be very
important for us

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.700
because we're going to
come to safety guidelines,

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.000
and in my opinion the right
way to think about a safety

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.630
guideline is you don't
want one person to cause

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:08.980
one or more infections.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:13.120
You'd like the expectation to be
that less than one person will

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.200
get infected.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.570
So this, what I'm
calling early times here,

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.790
in the epidemiological
model is actually

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.950
very relevant for,
like, safety guidelines.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:22.450
You don't want to
deal with the case

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:23.740
where there's rampant infection.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.780
You just want to say if
an infected person comes

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.140
in the room, are they going
to infect anybody else.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.890
And you want that to
be a low probability.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.080
So this is a very
relevant limit.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.170
Now, if I take that limit here,
I can expand this exponential,

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:38.920
and I find that e
of t at early times

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.720
behaves like s0
times q of t if s0

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.530
is the number of susceptibles.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.680
And if I plug in
what we have here,

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:54.620
that's n minus i0 times i0 times
the integral in time of beta.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:00.250
And so this is the
expected number

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:04.630
of people that will be
infected by i0 infected people.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.970
So the ratio of these two
things is very important.

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:12.530
So if I look at e in time tau.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.740
I should say we do this
integral-- typically

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.560
we want to go up to dd which is
the time that the person spends

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:21.460
in the room, and we divide
by the initial number,

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.380
then that's basically
telling us sort

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.280
of what's the reproductive
number of the room.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.600
i0 people come in,
and the question

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.810
is do more than i0 people
come out that are infected.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.160
So have you infected others?

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.600
So that's the ratio that
you really care about.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:40.460
And so I would call this the
indoor reproductive number.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:46.570
And in this case, if
we pick i0 equal to 1,

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:55.060
then this is n minus
1, 0 to tau beta dt.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.270
So that's going to be an
important thing, which we'll

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.630
come back to later, which is
the definition of kind of what

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.030
makes a room actually safe.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:06.390
Well, what we'd like to do
is have this quantity be

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.420
much less than 1 because I want
to say if one infector comes

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.520
in the room and
everybody is currently

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.280
susceptible and healthy,
I want to make sure

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.580
that less than one person
actually gets infected

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.110
And there'll be
some tolerance maybe

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:21.690
on how low I'd like
that to be, but that's

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:23.040
a very important concept.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.400
And here you see it comes out
of the slow incubation limit.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.320
What I'd like to
show you next is

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.710
that the very same indoor
reproductive number actually

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:35.070
occurs for any model
including the opposite limit

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.820
of fast incubation.
