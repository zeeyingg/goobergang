00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:31.490
JULIAN BEINART: OK.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:41.010
Before we start, I've spoken
to a quite number of you

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.090
about your papers.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.140
I'm a little surprised that
you have so much intelligence

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.150
and so show little
in this class.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.510
It often fascinates me.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.910
I have various
theories to explain it,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.410
but they're not important.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.280
Let me start off
by asking you what

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.830
you thought about the
story of Johannesburg.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.200
What struck you?

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:26.152
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:30.790
AUDIENCE: What was the story
you told of the additions

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.475
to the houses?

00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:32.350
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.190
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.440
I guess what struck me with
that is that, you know,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.770
on the one hand, there's
this constant appreciation

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.670
of sort of individuals' efforts
and vernacular practices

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.420
that come about.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.350
But then those so rarely
are institutionalized

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.820
and are often restricted.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.200
So that was one
thing that struck me.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200
JULIAN BEINART: Well,
these were not restricted,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.755
nor institutionalized.

00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:05.880
AUDIENCE: No, they weren't.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.930
Yeah.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.259
But I guess in
common in practice--

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.920
but here in the States, if
you're zoning through so many

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.530
things, you know that that is--

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.380
even if that's
appreciated, there's

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.080
never much thought into
how to encourage that.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.760
JULIAN BEINART: Well,
we presume that we

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.650
passed the stage of needing
to externalize our importance.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.280
We haven't got the
motive for doing it.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.430
If we have, we do it in
tyranny and not externally,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.260
so the theory would go.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.860
We still believe,
probably, that we've

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.090
reached a level of
civilization that

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.725
doesn't require idiosyncratic
or highly personal expressions

00:03:17.725 --> 00:03:18.225
in public.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.770
We look at popular
art all over Africa

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.080
and say that this is a culture
which has properties, but is

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.590
still moving towards a climax.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.330
Its climax will be--

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.235
much, though, the world of
Manhattan would be a climax.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.600
That's one theory.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:04:02.800
Another theory is that, in
people in the developing world,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.670
there are not many
resources available to them.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.920
So they have to develop
their own resources.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.770
Later in this class, when
I talk about Slum Dwellers

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.579
International and the
latest configurations

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.740
of self-help
organization, you will

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.740
see that the strength of
people to organize themselves,

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.920
a fundamental
premise of anarchism,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.080
is now rearing its head
as the only resource

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.800
that poor people have against
enormous bureaucratic odds.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.155
So you can see it is a
very optimistic idea.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.370
The successes of SDI and its
equivalent on three continents

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.640
so far would suggest
that there is something

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:10.380
to be gained from not exploiting
but using or collectivizing

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.000
the resources of
people in poverty

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.410
towards organizing a
better situation for them.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.210
John Turner in Latin America,
John Aubrachen in Holland,

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.410
were both at MIT at the
time I arrived here.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:40.770
And we shared stories about
what this kind of thing meant.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.310
Any other reactions?

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.380
What about the imposition
of racial classification?

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.990
Does the market impose
similar strictures

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.680
on the location of people?

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.630
Was the South African
situation just another version,

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:15.450
an extreme version, of what
the market does anyway?

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.280
Remember Western Native Township
was located next to a dump.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:29.010
Soweto was located next
to very obnoxious land.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.920
I think sewage farms and so on.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.810
Isn't this what happens?

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.300
Look, I'm looking at
extreme situations

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.990
in order to do the difficult
thing of generalizing back

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.850
to normality.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.755
I'm not taking Boston as a case.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.570
I'm not taking
[INAUDIBLE]---- well,

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.430
I am taking
[INAUDIBLE] as a case.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:05.920
And what I'm trying to do is
what perhaps medical professors

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.150
do when looking at
teaching about cancer.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.150
They look at the worst
case, the most extreme case

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.600
of the disease, in
order to make the point

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.450
as clearly as possible.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:25.190
I think there is a sense
in my using Johannesburg.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.960
South Africa would not have
been marginalized had it not put

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.090
race classification into law.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.300
Nobody boycotted America in
the early years of the century,

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:46.510
of the last century, by
having local conditions

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.650
against Black people.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.030
Many of the countries who
voted against South Africa

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.130
in the United
Nations were imposing

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:04.810
harsher, but not legalized
national constitutional devices

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.860
in favor of the separation
of white and Black

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.030
or poor and rich.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.520
Does that make any sense?

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.625
What about rejoicing on the
products of poor people?

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.980
When poor people struggle
to maintain some decent life

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.215
beyond poverty, we rejoice.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.000
AUDIENCE: Are you saying
this from a schadenfreude

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.658
perspective or from a--

00:08:47.658 --> 00:08:48.700
JULIAN BEINART: Probably.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.065
AUDIENCE: --or from a-- we
just enjoy what they produce

00:08:51.065 --> 00:08:51.690
and enjoy the--

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.300
JULIAN BEINART: It's difficult.
I'm judging from the response

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.780
that I have had in many
parts of the world when

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.940
showing this material over
a number of years on the BBC

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.700
and all over the place.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.700
It was on the cover of three
architectural magazines

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.810
in the same month in 1966.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.190
It's a long time ago,
but there was something.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.200
Whenever I went
somewhere, architects

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:34.470
were saying, gosh, if only we,
our clients in social housing,

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.920
had that capacity to
individuate the buildings.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.590
And John Aubrachen,
amongst others,

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.130
made big theory in his
book supports and others

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:56.650
of the process of indwelling
as being something

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.410
that we should cultivate.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:03.730
Architects should only build
if it required support systems

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.716
to let people finish
the work themselves.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.360
In the three cases
which I want to deal

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.770
with very briefly
this afternoon,

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.440
we find a number of
different things operating.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:29.260
The Mexican-American
border is 1,952 miles long.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.190
It's the longest border in
the world, the least defended

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:34.570
and the most patrolled.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.690
It's the largest tourist
crossing in anywhere

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:44.350
in the world.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:54.930
Yet it has 11 binational
cities along the border.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:05.560
They vary from Tijuana,
San Ysidro, San Diego,

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:17.020
to Ciudad Juarez, and El Paso
to the wonderful mix Californian

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.960
pair of Calexico
and Mexicali, which

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:25.090
is a wonderful anagram
of the linguistics.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:31.570
Nogales, Nogales, Brownsville,
Matamoros on the Gulf.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.220
How should we regard the cities?

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.830
I will show evidence to
show that they operate

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:46.340
in some ways as unified
metropolitan areas, which

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:52.370
would mean that this
subregion along the border

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.910
could be justified as
a separate identity

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.632
from either Mexico
and the United States.

00:11:59.632 --> 00:12:01.590
AUDIENCE: When I was in
the Mexican government,

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:06.080
we used to study
the thesis a lot.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.390
And I remember talking
to people especially,

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:13.010
in Tijuana San Diego, on
both sides of the border.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:16.610
They actually refer to the
city as the Metropolitan area

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.530
Tijuana San Diego.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:22.490
And their perspective
on the crossing point,

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.770
on the checkpoint
right at the border,

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.340
is [INAUDIBLE] sort of
a permanent nuisance

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.600
that they have to deal
with in their daily lives.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:36.015
Because people work and
commute daily to the city.

00:12:36.015 --> 00:12:36.890
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:46.970
In all of these cases, there's
an important friction system

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.380
operating.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.520
In this case, it's between white
people and non-white people,

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:57.870
between people of Hispanic
heritage or an Indian heritage

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:58.370
and--

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:08.120
El Paso is amongst the poorest
parts of the United States.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.820
When I was on the border in--

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.430
after Jimmy Carter
became president,

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.920
I attended some of
the meetings which

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.440
he and the Mexican
president set up

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.350
on some of these border towns.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:37.520
Octavio Paz says that
Mexico, crossing the border,

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.430
is one of the ways
in which Americans

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.140
satisfy their obsessions.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.630
It refers to a larger idea.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:53.940
And that is the uses of
slums in metropolitan areas.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.180
In Sherlock Holmes,
the Prince Royal

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:03.480
goes off to smoke or take
cocaine in the East Indian

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.190
London.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:09.510
Sherlock Holmes himself
smokes something or other.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:15.770
The poorest part
of the population

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:21.380
provides a setting for the
doing of semi-legal or illegal

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.300
things, prostitution and so on.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:30.530
So if you enlarge that and
you see Tijuana and San

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:34.460
Diego as a pair--

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:40.100
in Kevin Lynch and [INAUDIBLE]
study of San Diego of Tijuana,

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.590
which is in the
reading, it's one

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.790
of the best pieces of small
scale difficult planning

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.860
that I know.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.020
It's in the reading
for today's class.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:06.570
You get a sense of
this idea that--

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.960
remember Steve McQueen?

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.860
He's a famous
American male actor

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:17.670
who got cancer and a lot of
publicity associated with him

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:21.460
crossing the border to the
South to get the illegal drug

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.740
laetrile, which is not
available in the United States.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.410
Of course, it didn't
kill his cancer.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:31.110
But the phenomenon
of there being

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:34.530
a haven, a special
environment which

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:38.940
provides the majority
or the superior,

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:45.000
quote "superior" class,
with satisfactions

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.420
which are elicit in
their own surroundings.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.130
AUDIENCE: The phenomenon
still stands today.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:55.557
Close to the border, there's
a huge amount of pharmacies.

00:15:55.557 --> 00:15:56.390
JULIAN BEINART: Yes.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.320
AUDIENCE: They sell medicines
that here, in the States,

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.440
would be either restricted by a
prescription or not available.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.970
JULIAN BEINART: Well,
two reactions to that--

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:11.540
the border between East
Germany and West Germany--

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:18.560
also, borders attract a
kind of marginal population.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.520
There's a wonderful little
book in your reading called

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.840
On The Border by Tom Miller--

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.330
he's a New York
Times journalist--

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.630
which records a trip from
Brownsville, Matamoros

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:37.130
all the way to Tijuana and the
extraordinary things he find.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.460
He finds a town
which specializes

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:46.880
in the smuggling of peacocks to
Chicago in the back of trucks.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:52.280
He finds the most powerful AM
station in the United States,

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.850
a right-wing propaganda
radio station

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.430
which the government of
China asked the United

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.850
States to intervene with.

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:06.710
So there's a kind
of erotic condition

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.035
where you bring two
notions together.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:18.180
I don't know what the
theory behind that is.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:22.510
But it seems to be the
case that the behavior

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:27.540
of a lot of activities
on this border

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.167
are different from the internet.

00:17:30.167 --> 00:17:32.250
AUDIENCE: There is a book
by the editor of Foreign

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.470
Revue [INAUDIBLE] Moises Naim.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:38.460
The book is called
Illicit, where

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:43.620
he studies borders in
details as constructs that,

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.650
because of their--

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:50.190
artificial blockage of
goods, services, and people's

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:54.540
daily activities, it brings
out a particular kind

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.960
of inhabitant of these places.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.440
JULIAN BEINART: This
Mexican-American border

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.230
serves a number of
other functions.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:08.910
It serves as the major
avenue of illegal immigration

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.950
into the United States.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.470
I don't know if there's
illegal immigration south

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:17.820
from the United States
into Mexico, but--

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.070
AUDIENCE: There are a lot
of people that go to Mexico.

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.020
We don't ask
Americans for a visa.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.920
They enter, and then they
stay in Mexico and live there.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.970
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.850
There are, according
to government sources,

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:34.230
12 million illegal immigrants
in the United States.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.580
The census or one of
the government agencies

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:45.060
claims it only arrests
one out of four people who

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.580
try to take their bodies.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.665
56% of illegal immigrants
in this country are Mexican.

00:18:55.210 --> 00:19:01.030
So this border serves as
an avenue for the movement

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.880
of people from--

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.230
what would you call Mexico?

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.550
What would you call
the United States?

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:14.890
The United States offers more,
presumably more, opportunities

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.840
for increasing wealth.

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:23.770
There are many stories
that are humorous

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:27.790
surrounding that there are
people who live in Mexico

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:31.460
and work in the United
States illegally every day.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.730
One of the stories
in our meeting

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:38.620
was told by a young man who
dresses up in jogging clothes

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:42.310
like an American, crosses
the border every morning at 5

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:47.440
o'clock, starts jogging
on the American side

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:55.610
and works as a gardener,
returns home at night.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.550
These are funny stories.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.700
Immigration into
the United States

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:06.280
is politically and spatially
still very unresolved.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.890
America was built by immigrants.

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.700
I'm an immigrant.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.105
And I've taught
here for 34 years.

00:20:16.105 --> 00:20:20.730
It shows how poor the
local population is.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.040
I'm jumping all over the place.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.360
I just want to cite you
statistic about immigration.

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:50.800
"United States remains
a magnet for immigrants.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.120
The US is among the best
at assimilating them.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.970
As a result, half the
world's skilled immigrants

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.010
come to the US.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:03.970
Between 1990 and
2005, immigrants

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:07.103
started a quarter of the new
venture-backed public companies

00:21:07.103 --> 00:21:08.020
in the United States."

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.620
So again, we are at
the crossroads theory.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:20.180
On the one hand there's
the conservative position

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:24.590
that a nation should take
care of its own people

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.990
and selectively
choose people who

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:30.020
wish to get into
that country, not

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:36.860
have a random system of entry.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:42.830
The US Congress is likely to
take up immigration following

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:50.230
the failure of the
previous President Bush

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:57.220
who comes from Texas and was
under a lot of pressure, set

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:04.810
about building a $60 billion
fence over the 2,000 miles.

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:11.590
He reduced it to 700 miles,
ran into enormous problems

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:20.450
of land rights in Texas
and was sued and abandoned

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:21.200
the whole project.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.500
What else about the
Mexican-American border?

00:22:33.464 --> 00:22:35.100
AUDIENCE: Right now
in Mexico, there

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.715
is a huge [INAUDIBLE]
immigration

00:22:37.715 --> 00:22:41.750
reform because of what
happened on [INAUDIBLE]..

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.150
But they were talking
about immigration reform

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:47.437
in the early Bush days in 2001.

00:22:47.437 --> 00:22:49.770
Actually, President Fox came
as well to the conference--

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:50.645
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:22:50.645 --> 00:22:52.850
AUDIENCE: --one
week before 9/11.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:57.520
As soon as 9/11 happened, that
whole discussion got derailed.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.900
And the priorities
of US policy shifted.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.270
So it moved from an idea
of having an immigration

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.210
reform to an idea of security.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.363
And we've been talking
about immigration.

00:23:11.363 --> 00:23:13.280
There's a lot of talk
about immigration reform

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.330
again or getting back
into the political agenda.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:20.780
And now that the marathon
bombings happened again,

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.660
you can follow it
up in Mexican media.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.850
There's another notion
of, oh my god, it's

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.110
this story all over again.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:28.360
It's happening all over again.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:33.950
It's going to be the security
concerns are going to take over

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.310
the political discussion.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.185
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:49.880
Cheap labor is important in a
capitalist industrial economy.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.070
So immigration will be
supported by capitalists--

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.910
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:55.290
JULIAN BEINART: --i.e.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:59.610
people who politically
are normally conservative.

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:03.750
So there's an ambiguity
about this position.

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:06.660
The strength of cheap labor--

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:12.240
Mitt Romney was accused
of using Mexican workers

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.055
to fix his garden without
paying them legally.

00:24:16.055 --> 00:24:16.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.960
JULIAN BEINART:
Anyway, what do you--

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.340
you have a population
in this belt

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.710
on either side of
the border where

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:37.820
people speak two languages,
share telephone services.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.910
Industries in one country
are located across the border

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:42.770
into another--

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:50.240
there's 3,000 American
industries which pay no taxes.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.980
They move south
across the border,

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.790
but pay tax only when
the finished products are

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.490
returned to the United States.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:03.350
This is the second largest
labor source in Mexico

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:07.550
according to a recent
item that I read.

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:13.160
So we have the United States
exporting its industries

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:18.090
around the world to
pools of cheap labor.

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:21.800
One of the closest and,
therefore, reducing the costs

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:25.530
of transportation is Mexico.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.610
So you have another
version of the relationship

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.160
between these two countries.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.340
Pro this kind of
effort are people

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:41.300
who believe that it stimulates
jobs in a poor country.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:49.570
And then there is a backward
relationship of strong--

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.930
actually, a relevant part
of the Mexican population

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:58.280
that feels that it's a
highly unjust situation

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.290
because the territory of most of
the western [INAUDIBLE] states

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:06.310
in the US used to
belong to them.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:07.990
So there's a social
resentment that

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:12.220
has grown in parts of
the population that

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.990
has been instigated.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.910
JULIAN BEINART: Yes, I
should have mentioned.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:20.560
For so many of you not
Americans or Mexicans

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:26.255
that the present status of the
border is the result of war.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.700
Much of Texas, California,
Arizona, a number of states

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.185
even going as far as Wyoming--

00:26:36.185 --> 00:26:40.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's California,
Nevada, Colorado, part

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:44.273
of Wyoming, Arizona,
New Mexico, Texas.

00:26:44.273 --> 00:26:45.565
JULIAN BEINART: And California.

00:26:45.565 --> 00:26:46.710
AUDIENCE: And California.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:47.680
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.180
Yeah.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:56.030
There's a long history
to all of this.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:27:01.940
Between 1846 and 1854,
the United States

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:09.860
won a war against Mexico
in which the United States

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:13.910
took possession of a large
part of the Southwest

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:18.870
of the current United States
and paid Mexico $18 million.

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:25.460
That includes the
Gadsden Purchase, which

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:30.300
was an additional operation.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:39.170
So this border dates
back to the same date

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:44.430
that Haussmann took
power in Paris,

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:49.940
a number of European
conflagrations in 1848.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:57.470
1848, there were 137,000
British troops in India.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:02.540
It's a signal date, 1850, 1848.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:08.880
1850-- London, the
largest city in the world,

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:14.450
the first European city to
be the largest since Rome.

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:18.780
So many things
have a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.140
But I think it's
important to point out

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:25.010
that this heritage,
which you point to,

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:33.640
is probably more likely to be
absorbed now except for people

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.030
who wish to maintain
their political enemies

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:38.580
against the United States.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.190
The future for all of
these situations-- and I'm

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:52.190
going to try to cut
these stories short

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:57.590
and ask you to ponder as to
what the urban mystic response

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.450
should be to these places.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:03.980
You are likely to
be asked, like I

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:13.750
was, to venture an opinion about
one of the days on the border

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:20.980
the chief planner of
Juarez, who is Mexican,

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:25.060
and the chief planner of El
Paso, who's Mexican-American,

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:28.630
met for the first time
in these discussions.

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:29.950
They discussed water.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:32.470
They discussed
illegal settlement.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:37.230
They discussed fumes that were
coming from the Asarco lead

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:42.220
plant into Mexico.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.120
That night there was a dinner.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.250
And I was sitting
next to the woman who

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:53.470
was the representative of the
US government Foreign Service.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:56.620
And she asked me how I
was enjoying the day.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.940
And I said, it was remarkable.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:03.610
It felt so positive about this
interaction and the promises

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:06.340
that the people
made to each other.

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.610
She said to me,
remember, we fought a war

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.050
against these people once.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:20.110
So my naive academicism
was piloted off

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.450
in a very bad direction.

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:28.505
What else can I say about--

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:35.890
read Tom Miller's book
if you want to know

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:37.300
what the border is like.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:45.415
I think we'll leave the
Mexican-American bipolar

00:30:45.415 --> 00:30:45.915
series.

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:58.910
The piece I gave
you in the handout

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:09.430
today from 1981 US
News and World Report--

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.970
"Where Yanks and Mexicans
Live Together and Like It."

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.490
"Linked by twin
industries, two-way trade,

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:19.090
and now by trolley line,
San Diego and Tijuana

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:23.550
offer an object lesson in
international cooperation."

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.320
I don't know if
that is justified,

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:35.874
but I leave it to you to
make a judgment about that.

00:31:35.874 --> 00:31:47.770
The fact is that there
are not many conditions

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:55.690
in the world where two nations,
one presumably belonging

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:58.540
to the First World, another
belonging presumably

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:03.590
to the Second World, go inside.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:10.390
European cities extend
their labor relationships

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:17.680
across to North Africa to
Turkey as migrant labor.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:22.120
South Africa built its
gold mines on migrant labor

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:27.100
from as far north as
Malawi and Tanzania.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:31.210
But here we have a
conjunction of two systems

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:38.080
around urban areas, which
are just a fence away

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:38.880
from each other.

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:46.090
One of the models for
the future of Jerusalem

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:51.940
was, in fact, a
kind of city which

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:56.350
had no border running
through the city.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:33:00.100
It wasn't a divided city
at all, but the city

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:04.960
which mediated issues such
as customs and security

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.450
in other ways.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:10.090
Maybe with electronic
technology we'll

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:14.080
be able to introduce
ways of assessing

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:21.040
personal movement and personal
behavior more adequately.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:26.890
One is always fascinated by what
happened on Monday afternoon

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:29.630
here in Boston.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:36.470
This lecture is being recorded,
so I have to add the date.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:41.090
This is the Monday after
the marathon bombing.

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:44.450
How much evidence
seems to be available

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:48.980
simply through the common
practice of people, teenagers

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:52.850
having telephones
which record material?

00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:02.410
So one maybe in future be
able to see enormous diversity

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:10.015
to cities, given an
environment of relative peace.

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:20.770
If you look back historically at
Europe, the wars between Spain

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:24.820
and Holland, between
Spain and England,

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:30.250
between France and Germany,
between Germany and Poland

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:35.500
and Russia, between
Napoleon and northern Italy,

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:45.120
between the Muslim city
of Istanbul and Budapest

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.800
and Vienna.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.820
I mean, I'm not even
going very far back.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:56.520
I'm going back to the 18th
century, 17th century.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.830
To believe, at that
time, that there

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:02.100
would be a common union
in which there would

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:05.775
be no passports required to
move from France into Belgium

00:35:05.775 --> 00:35:08.400
or from France into
Germany would have

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.310
been impossible to imagine.

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:14.500
One of the things I
learned from Kevin Lynch

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:20.170
was his incredible belief in
the capacity of human beings

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:23.750
to improve themselves.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:27.350
And his evidence was
always that urbanism

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:33.920
could be properly administered,
be a vehicle for doing this.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.500
Cities educate people.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:37.770
They teach them new ways.

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:39.740
Johannesburg is not
the city that it

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:42.670
was when Soweto was created.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:50.070
The reason, as I mentioned
over and over again last week,

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:53.550
was the South Africa
sought for a rural solution

00:35:53.550 --> 00:36:00.370
to its problems because
urbanism educated people

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:05.810
to their political
right, to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:10.830
And the Bantustan
policy which was

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:16.260
the last of the major efforts
by the Afrikaner government

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:21.300
in South Africa was anti-urban.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:28.370
We move to the
broad body of stuff,

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:34.790
which we normally refer to as
colonial-native relationships.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.710
A colonial-native
relationship is a relationship

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:55.810
in which a dominant external
force occupies another country

00:36:55.810 --> 00:37:01.220
and imposes its will around
a number of polarities.

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:13.850
For Britain it was
dangerous to go to India.

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:20.330
The life expectancy
of a British soldier,

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:28.670
if they stayed in Britain
in 1883, was 59.5 years.

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:33.270
If they went to India,
it was 37.7 years.

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:36.260
So the preoccupation
of the British

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:40.700
was that India was an
extraordinary environment.

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.860
It was dangerous.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:46.040
It was also seductive.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:51.740
The British, under
Victorian rule,

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:55.130
by and large
repressed sexuality.

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:58.670
You come to India where
sexuality is abundant

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:00.800
not in terms of
personal behavior,

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.970
but in terms of
cultural expression.

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:08.290
If you really E.M. Forster's
book of Passage to India

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:11.000
in 1924--

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.310
has anybody read Forster?

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:16.400
He's one of the greatest
English writers.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.840
You must read him.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.060
Read a Passage to India.

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:25.090
You'll get a--
look what happens.

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:31.780
A young English
woman called Adele

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:40.880
arrives in India to marry
the son of the Mrs. Briggs,

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.380
I think.

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.370
I'm not sure.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.650
I don't remember.

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:51.020
They meet a handsome young
Indian doctor called Dr. Aziz.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:58.960
Dr. Aziz is a
trained medical man.

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:05.320
And the interaction
is quite spontaneous.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:10.750
Dr. Aziz invites them, the
mother and this young woman,

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:16.240
to visit some caves nearby
called the cave the Macabar.

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.345
This is all fictitious, of
course, but you see the story.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:27.290
This young woman is so
distraught in the caves

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:31.190
by the echo that
come back whenever

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:33.410
they speak that she goes off.

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:38.000
She goes crazy and runs away.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.590
She comes back to the
British civil station

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:46.715
and accuses Dr. Aziz of
having assaulted sexually.

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:58.300
The British claim that
Indian men are sexually

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:03.250
attracted to white
British women and should

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:06.892
be punished for that.

00:40:06.892 --> 00:40:11.050
The Indians claim
that this is a hoax,

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:13.480
that this woman was hysterical.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:19.930
It goes to court and Dr. Aziz
is, at the end of the book,

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:24.940
freed from the case because
this woman breaks down in court

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:30.958
and admits that she made
the wrong accusation.

00:40:30.958 --> 00:40:32.500
AUDIENCE: There's
a very telling part

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:39.000
of in the story about the button
on the back of the shirt, which

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.660
Dr. Aziz shares to an
Englishman, but had forgotten.

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:47.130
And then when they're
qualifying Dr. Aziz

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:50.520
and they get to the button,
they link that to the notion

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:54.600
that no Indian could ever
behave like a true gentlemen

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.314
because they forget
the small details.

00:40:56.314 --> 00:40:58.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:58.210 --> 00:40:59.380
So they tie it down.

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:02.770
And it tells you a
lot of the rigidity

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:06.580
that society played on
all those small constructs

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:13.045
as artificial
classifiers of people.

00:41:13.045 --> 00:41:13.920
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:17.190
You know, it raises
another issue for me.

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:24.300
And that is we require novelists
to see a situation and write

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:28.350
about it in a way that
reality cannot do.

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:32.010
That is for those of
you interested in film

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:35.655
and its impact on our
understanding of cities.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:44.840
There's so many movies
which depict conditions

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.050
in cities in heightened form.

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:54.590
It took E.M. Forster sitting at
Cambridge to write a book at--

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:57.260
he visited India.

00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:01.070
Anyway, so here the
polarities are complex.

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:08.180
For the British, they
were three diseases

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:11.645
that had to be counted,
environmental diseases

00:42:11.645 --> 00:42:18.020
of the air, vegetation,
soil, water, humidity.

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:21.860
Number two-- behavioral
diseases, diet, alcohol.

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:27.200
And number three-- social
diseases, sexual diseases.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:32.210
I will show you
some of the images

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:35.630
from some of the literature.

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:42.100
One of the notions
was that disease,

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:46.150
as in London about
the same time,

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:49.450
was carried through the air.

00:42:49.450 --> 00:43:01.070
So the ventilation system in
the bungalow and in the hat

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:05.495
was a similar situation which
allowed air to pass through.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:12.890
I will show you a section
through a parade ground, which

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:16.770
is ventilated up and down.

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:20.310
I'll show you a diagram
of the amount of air

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:23.340
you need to be safe.

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:29.220
This is all before Snow and
the discovery of cholera

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.545
as the waterborne disease.

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:40.830
The choice, you will
see, for an Indian,

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:45.000
at least for an
English bureaucrat,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.960
was between a bungalow--

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:54.510
bungalow, again, is a term which
comes from the native language,

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:56.210
from [NON-ENGLISH].

00:43:56.210 --> 00:44:03.090
You must remember
that the headquarters

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:06.540
of the capital of India
with Calcutta before it

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:11.290
was moved by the British
to Delhi from a [LAUGHTER]

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:18.390
world, world of speaking
another language to Hindu.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:21.450
The word veranda is
also a word that's

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:28.700
been built into
English architecture.

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.810
There are a number
these terms which

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:34.590
refer to spatial components
of the colonial city--

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:38.100
the maidan, which
is that breathing

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:43.680
space of open space
between the native city,

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.840
much like South Africa.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:53.520
The native city and the
new white enterprise

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.440
would be separated by space.

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.160
Critical distance
was another feature

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:02.580
of the dominant-native
relationship.

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:06.990
You want to be as far
as possible from them.

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:14.250
A book colonial city argues that
the French colonial environment

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:17.100
was different because
the French have always

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:23.980
assumed a more liberal
position about body contact.

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:25.780
And the British have
always resisted.

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:30.400
So the British-- the
notion of staying

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:34.150
as far away from the native
not only because of the air,

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:40.030
but of some kind of
distancing of context,

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:43.885
metaphysical perhaps, but
also physical and spatial.

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:51.355
Typically, the British built
a military presence first

00:45:51.355 --> 00:45:57.070
or the cantonment on the
other side of the maidan,

00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:00.040
and then built what is
called the civil station just

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.840
beyond the cantonment.

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.450
The civil station
was, again, a set

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:09.520
of bungalows spaced like a
suburban American landscape

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:15.760
with enough air floating
around, and nothing was dense.

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.400
The native city was dense.

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.340
I'll show you some
images of the native city

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:25.490
from the British view.

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:36.110
So attenuated space was
an important component.

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:42.290
I've given you two pages
on the next big adventure,

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:43.955
and that's the
building of New Delhi.

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.600
The building of New Delhi,
or the planning in New Delhi,

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:55.770
took a number of forms.

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:01.230
One of the important
members of the committee

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:06.690
was a man called Lanchester,
John Lanchester, who

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:11.250
was an acolyte of Patrick
Geddes and believed

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:13.680
in constructive surgery.

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:18.480
So his first ambition
was to link the new plan

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:21.660
to the native city of
Shahjahanabad, which

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:25.830
is one of the oldest
cities in the Far East.

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:27.190
I think since--

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:29.100
God only knows-- the 13th.

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.910
When was the origin
of Shahjahanabad?

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:33.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:37.860
JULIAN BEINART: Prior to Shah
Jahan, it was a settlement.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:41.570
In the 14th century, it was
considered the largest city

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:44.100
in the Far East.

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:49.250
So Shahjahanabad,
after the riots,

00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:52.680
the British took over
parts of Shahjahanabad

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:56.650
and made it a military
presence as well.

00:47:56.650 --> 00:48:02.730
But Lanchester's plan was
to try to link Shahjahanabad

00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:05.460
to this new development.

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:12.240
There are various iterations by
the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.220
and Sir Herbert Baker.

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:19.230
Here what I've given
you is a sketch

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:27.150
of five different planned
discussions ultimately

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:32.400
resulting on the Raisina Hill
solution, the [INAUDIBLE] Hill

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.570
Solution.

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:37.560
The notion which
prevails throughout

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:43.260
is that British classicism
or the British interpretation

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:46.350
of Greek and Roman
classicism was

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:49.800
a way of educating the native
population to standards

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:53.140
which they couldn't
achieve by themselves.

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:59.650
The second one was that the site
needed to be high in elevation,

00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:03.480
so that it would
dominate the world.

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:07.320
These are primitive
ideas which you

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.090
can see in the
laws of the Indies

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:14.220
as well of a
colonial proposition

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:20.520
needing to educate and
subdue the population.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.692
Remember, in the
laws of the India,

00:49:22.692 --> 00:49:25.050
the rules are that
the natives are not

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:29.080
allowed to see the cathedral
until it's finished.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.790
You have to use the force
of the cathedral's elevation

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:34.890
to dominate.

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:38.820
You cannot see the
construction of the cathedral.

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:44.230
The construction is a process
of admitting viability--

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:47.145
not admitting viability--
admitting weakness.

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:57.610
So Edwin Lutyens, who was
a very good architect--

00:49:57.610 --> 00:49:58.440
you should look.

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.080
For those who are
interested in architecture,

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:07.320
look at his project Lindisfarne
in England quite different

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.850
from this.

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:12.600
Anyway, I'll just
quote the manifestation

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.605
of some of these ideas.

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.760
"Indian buildings,
even the Taj Mahal,

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.910
were picturesque and
decorative, but pervaded

00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:28.850
by childish ignorance
of the basic principles

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:32.340
of architecture.

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:34.740
The Indic style,
he argued, simply

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:37.980
does not have the constructive
and geometrical qualities

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:41.640
necessary to embody the
idea of law and order, which

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:45.500
is being produced out of chaos
by the British administration.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.850
Would [INAUDIBLE],, he
wrote sarcastically,

00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:56.000
had he gone to Australia,
have burnt his knowledge

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.101
and experience to produce
a marsupial style?"

00:51:00.101 --> 00:51:05.390
Can you imagine a marsupial
style in Australia?

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:10.970
His argument is that to
disembody classicism, which

00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:14.660
had been produced out
of centuries of thought

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:22.030
by Europeans, to disembody it
and to make it into Indianism

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:28.190
would not only be
difficult and foolish,

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:30.560
but would not
embody the purposes

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.720
of British colonialism.

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:41.180
That is to educate and
maintain dominance over people.

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:51.330
So correctly speaking,
classicism used in this sense

00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:54.900
is a disembodiment
of the universality

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.730
of human experience.

00:51:56.730 --> 00:52:01.140
He says that human experience
is manifest at a higher

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:10.860
level in 500 BC in
Greece and is maintained

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:19.350
for 2000 years as the
dominant form of expression

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:23.190
in architecture
not to be vitiated

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:28.870
by any local cultural evidence.

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:32.410
Of course, there were no
great Indian architects.

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:38.820
One has to look at Chandigarh
as another importation

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:45.240
of a European architect to deal
with this question of what is

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.570
Indian and what is universal.

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:54.630
We'll deal with Chandigarh in
this class if we have time.

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:01.650
I recently wrote a
piece on Chandigarh

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:08.640
for a book, which is
a result of a talk we

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:14.190
gave at the 50th
anniversary of Chandigarh.

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:25.940
So all of this adds up to
a very concise explanation

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:30.440
of the planning and
architectural content

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:38.570
of New Delhi as being an
expressive and controlled

00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:40.970
system of dominance.

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:49.650
We need to know now--

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:57.270
and I have many post-colonial
Indian architect friends

00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:00.240
and have been in
partnership with one.

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:04.680
So I think I understand a
little bit about their reaction.

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:09.090
Modernism was a
vehicle for destroying

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:13.380
all kinds of notions of
colonial-native relationships,

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:15.450
I think.

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:16.350
Do you think so?

00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:19.950
AUDIENCE: In some
way, not entirely.

00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:23.260
JULIAN BEINART: Not entirely--

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:27.450
but there were people like
Rudyard Kipling and his father,

00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:33.610
who also were British, who
took a different view of India.

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:41.220
So I suppose they were
eccentric to India.

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:48.200
but modernism has
allowed India to bypass

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:53.960
the question of style in a sense
as being politically important.

00:54:53.960 --> 00:55:00.740
I mean, people like [INAUDIBLE]
and many others have used

00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:06.870
modernism as a free liberal
expression of what they think

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:13.580
a new society should be about
despite the polarities between

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.850
Hindu and Muslim in
the current India,

00:55:16.850 --> 00:55:24.160
despite the enormous polarities
between wealth and poverty

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.350
after--

00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:28.996
anyway, so what do you think?

00:55:28.996 --> 00:55:30.940
AUDIENCE: I think
modernism has replaced

00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:35.190
even a lot of the traditional
Indian [INAUDIBLE] have.

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:37.900
The Indian architecture has
been influenced by [INAUDIBLE]..

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:40.710
And there's so many influences.

00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:42.550
JULIAN BEINART: Absolutely.

00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:46.465
AUDIENCE: By saying that
modernism is a free expression

00:55:46.465 --> 00:55:51.918
or is something that negates
all of that does not really--

00:55:51.918 --> 00:55:52.630
I don't know.

00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:53.380
It doesn't sound--

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:55.360
JULIAN BEINART: Well,
it doesn't negate it.

00:55:55.360 --> 00:56:01.500
But it was agnostic.

00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:09.850
It did not associate
itself with anything else,

00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:11.200
but its own invention.

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:23.644
In doing so, it denied the
aspirations of Indianism maybe.

00:56:23.644 --> 00:56:25.060
AUDIENCE: But what is Indianism?

00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:26.010
Because [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:27.800
JULIAN BEINART:
Well, absolutely.

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:31.730
So Chandigarh was easy to--

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:36.470
Nehru understood
that to get Corbusier

00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:42.650
to come along and design
his image of new capital

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:49.220
city for the Punjab
would require somebody

00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:53.810
who had the capacity
to overwhelm

00:56:53.810 --> 00:57:00.500
the Indianness in the same way
that Louis Khan in Bangladesh

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:04.460
built his world in Dhaka.

00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:09.200
Le Corbusier traveled
all over India before.

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.900
He writes all about
Indian construction

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:13.550
and Indian materials.

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:15.170
Louis Khan does the same thing.

00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:21.590
Louis Khan buildings,
parliament building,

00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:25.460
marks the end of a day of work.

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:30.140
And then the next day,
the bricks or the stones

00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:36.830
are sort of marked in relation
to the labor as if this is--

00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:41.640
I mean, this is
another big story.

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:45.020
But let's leave the
story to concentrate

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:47.350
on racial polarities.

00:57:55.010 --> 00:58:01.220
Maybe these extreme polarities
disappear with education,

00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:14.265
disappear with change, so
liberals would believe.

00:58:14.265 --> 00:58:15.640
AUDIENCE: So what
are you saying,

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.691
that through
education [INAUDIBLE]??

00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:27.830
JULIAN BEINART:
Through education one

00:58:27.830 --> 00:58:38.110
presumes that changes
in idle worship

00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:45.100
transform people to being
religious [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:47.356
in history.

00:58:47.356 --> 00:58:50.740
The European evidence of the--

00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:59.920
there's no animation-- no, not
animation, no active hostility

00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:02.260
between Spain and Holland.

00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:07.960
Although the Spanish did
terrible things to them.

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:10.990
We're going to do a class
on architecture and memory

00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:14.470
or urbanism and memory
because some of this

00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:17.040
has been written about.

00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:21.690
I do believe that the only
solution for Jerusalem,

00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:27.300
if there is any solution,
which is going to take time,

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:33.840
is if there were some force
which introduced itself

00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:37.680
into Israeli education.

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:43.890
Israeli education is dominated
by the religious groups, who

00:59:43.890 --> 00:59:48.780
insist on portraying Arabs
as rapists, and villains,

00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:49.890
and so on.

00:59:49.890 --> 00:59:52.341
The reverse is true.

00:59:52.341 --> 00:59:55.110
If you look at the
high school books, some

00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:57.570
of the books in
Jordan, and Syria,

00:59:57.570 --> 01:00:02.970
and so on, they depict Jews
as Shakespeare depicted

01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:06.580
the Merchant of Venice.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:12.700
Now, you don't go around
England any more writing

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:15.940
books about Jews as
the Merchant of Venice.

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:20.120
That stopped in
the 16th century.

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.600
So there's historic
evidence that people do,

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.310
cultures do, change their mind.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.260
What about the future
of Johannesburg?

01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:41.980
There are 40 million Black
people in South Africa today.

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:45.805
There are 6 million whites
and 6 million coloreds making

01:00:45.805 --> 01:00:47.620
a [INAUDIBLE] population.

01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:51.310
That means that Black people
are 80% of the total population

01:00:51.310 --> 01:00:52.630
of South Africa today.

01:00:57.030 --> 01:01:01.560
What is the policy
with regard to Soweto?

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:05.940
You are a brilliant
MIT graduate.

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:08.400
You're hired by
the United Nations

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:13.470
to advise the South African
government, as I was.

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:20.570
What do you do?

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:26.310
You've got to take care
of rebuilding education

01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:28.650
for 40 million people.

01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:36.400
You've got to introduce
health systems.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.610
You've got to provide jobs.

01:01:39.610 --> 01:01:42.925
25% of young Blacks in
Johannesburg don't have jobs.

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:52.950
You can't socialize the
society quickly enough

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:55.020
because foreign
investment, which

01:01:55.020 --> 01:02:02.700
is fundamental to South
Africa's capital, will flee.

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.100
So you cannot nationalize
the gold mines,

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:10.020
as many of the ANC
people have wanted to do.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.070
So let's look at Havana
and Cuba for a moment

01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:19.040
simply before we
write all of these

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.640
off as the dustbins of history.

01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:29.630
Look, this is tough stuff.

01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:33.430
It's not urban designers
planting a few trees in Iowa.

01:02:37.790 --> 01:02:44.000
This is what is happening by
and large in important parts

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.490
of the world and has happened.

01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:48.950
You've got to have
some understanding

01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:53.050
of these extremely
difficult situations.

01:02:57.650 --> 01:03:03.815
Havana was a Laws
of the Indies city.

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:24.290
Between 1959 and 1988, it was
host to Soviet sponsorship.

01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:26.990
And as I look at
the plans for when

01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:39.970
we were in Havana and in
end of 1978, I think--

01:03:39.970 --> 01:03:40.990
a couple of things.

01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:46.940
One of the ideas
taken from Russia

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:49.220
was to normalize
the relationship

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:51.445
between the country
and the city.

01:03:51.445 --> 01:03:55.430
If you remember Shirov's
plan for Moscow,

01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:58.520
which I discussed
with you, there

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:01.610
was an attempt to
increase public space

01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:06.290
on the periphery of the city
in a wide belt around the city.

01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:09.680
The only city in the world where
this has been put into place

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.180
is Havana.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:15.980
Lenin Park has increased
the number of square foot.

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:24.520
In 1959, there was 1 square
meter of open space per capita

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.780
in the city.

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:29.500
In 1978, when we
were there, it had

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:33.700
increased in 11 square meters
per capita, 3 in the city,

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:37.300
8 outside in Lenin Park.

01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.280
Whether people
are actively using

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.095
Lenin Park is another story.

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:52.920
Right from the first
Castro invasion,

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.680
it seemed that the
idea was to frustrate

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:59.460
the growth of the city
and favor the development

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:02.340
of the countryside.

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:06.990
Again, this idea is central to
South African apartheid, which

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:10.320
I mentioned over and over again,
but with a different meaning.

01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:17.540
You couldn't easily
migrate into Havana

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:20.030
unless you could find a job.

01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:24.160
At least you had
somewhere to stay.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.220
The population of
Havana decreased

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:30.550
after Castro's takeover.

01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:42.580
Instead of the huts and
small property ownership,

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:46.690
a new rural environment
was created.

01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:53.020
Small towns of 2,000 people
about 10 kilometers apart

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:55.510
were attempt--

01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:58.270
I'll show you some of them--

01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:05.890
to put a kind of layer of
measles across the land,

01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:10.190
all an attempt to rejuvenate
the idea of the country.

01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:12.850
One of the first things
that Castro did--

01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:17.050
Castro himself, his
government, his policies--

01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:23.200
were to take to send young
men and women from Havana out

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:27.490
into the country to
talk to older people

01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:31.750
and to try to teach them
how to read and write.

01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:35.920
The whole image
was a kind of world

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:42.730
in which there was the
division between rural poverty

01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:46.480
and urban wealth
would be destroyed.

01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:57.950
I often think
Israel and Cuba have

01:06:57.950 --> 01:07:01.790
a lot in common by virtue
of being small countries.

01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:06.740
In small countries, you have a
presence of the land in much--

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:14.840
how does a kid growing up in
New Jersey know about Yosemite?

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:15.820
It's too large.

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:16.660
It's too long.

01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:17.650
It's too big.

01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:19.930
It takes special effort.

01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:23.140
But if you're living
in Havana and it

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:27.640
takes 5 minutes to
get into the country,

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:30.130
it's a different story.

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:33.370
Young Jews in Israel
are enormously

01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:39.610
competent at biblical history
partly for political reasons,

01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:44.170
but also partly because
the sites are there.

01:07:44.170 --> 01:07:46.600
You go south to
the Negev, and you

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:54.460
can see where [INAUDIBLE]
sacrifice sheep or whatever.

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:56.440
I'm just making that up.

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:59.200
[INAUDIBLE] didn't
sacrifice any sheep.

01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:09.840
So the Picadura Valley,
one of the major changes

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:15.480
in the rural landscape, was
to the Picadura Valley was--

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:21.390
there are two major industries,
agricultural industries

01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:24.729
in Cuba, the
production of tobacco,

01:08:24.729 --> 01:08:27.330
which is a refined
cultured the industry

01:08:27.330 --> 01:08:31.620
and the production of sugar,
which is the harshest industry,

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:33.330
agricultural industry there is.

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:45.939
Castro made important efforts
to utilize these symbols.

01:08:45.939 --> 01:08:49.180
He didn't nationalize
the tobacco industry.

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:54.970
He allowed it to remain
under local control,

01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:56.605
but not nationalized.

01:08:56.605 --> 01:09:00.910
He nationalized the sugar
production industry completely

01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:02.859
and reduced its size.

01:09:02.859 --> 01:09:05.680
In the Picadura
Valley, for instance,

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:11.890
he removed all sugar growth
and resurfaced the land

01:09:11.890 --> 01:09:15.220
with new agricultural
material, got

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:20.470
Canada to help them to produce
a cow which could produce milk

01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:21.760
in the tropics.

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:28.750
The Picadura Valley now
produces milk for Cuba.

01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:31.779
These are important
elements of transforming

01:09:31.779 --> 01:09:33.580
the rural productive world.

01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:44.490
So the polarity, which I want
to focus on here, is just--

01:09:44.490 --> 01:09:46.290
there are many
other aspects of--

01:09:50.270 --> 01:10:00.480
by the way, modernism,
when we visited,

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:03.870
was the only style
of building that

01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:08.910
was available in modern
Cuba, decorated modernism

01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:11.970
using super graphics was very--

01:10:11.970 --> 01:10:13.865
I'll show some of
these products.

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:21.090
The use of the
past selectively--

01:10:21.090 --> 01:10:24.450
for instance, the
operation which

01:10:24.450 --> 01:10:30.060
sent Cuban troops to Angola
to help the African Liberation

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:32.940
movement was called
Operation Carlota.

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:35.360
Who is Carlota?

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:39.630
Carlota was this woman
slave who led the rebellion

01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:41.160
against the United
Fruit Company.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:48.050
It was a political move to--

01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:52.490
oh, god, I forgot
about the time.

01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:54.098
This is so interesting.

01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:58.910
Let's just leave it at that.

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:10.020
The Cuban story has transformed,
of course, since 1978.

01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:14.340
I'm talking about a time
when the pure impulse

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:19.080
under Soviet
dominance, the change--

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:25.530
the use of micro brigade labor
and so a whole set of things

01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:30.460
which operated at that time.

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:37.430
Cuba is now a
semi-socialist state,

01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:41.960
opening up to diverse
forms of homeownership,

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:48.680
property ownership, different
categories of tourism,

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:49.460
and so on.

01:11:52.670 --> 01:11:57.230
You see how much land of the
Southwest of the United States

01:11:57.230 --> 01:12:06.920
Mexico controlled in 1821,
1836, 1848 to 1854, and 1980.

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.560
This diagram indicates
the special list

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:17.685
of a region of 11 bipolar
cities strung over 2,000 miles.

01:12:17.685 --> 01:12:18.185
Next.

01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:24.680
This is a famous--

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.885
Ricardo, you were
referring to this image.

01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:34.440
This is a Mexican
settlement up to the border

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:40.620
in the case of Tijuana, various
conditions from Tom Miller's

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:48.380
book of the border running
across this vast distance.

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:48.880
Next.

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.930
Kevin Lynch and Donald
Appleyard's work

01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:59.280
looking at the regional
relationship between Tijuana

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:05.430
and San Diego
showing how water--

01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:08.490
water is one of the biggest
concerns between the United

01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:10.500
States and--

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:15.060
the United States claims that
Mexico owes the United States

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:22.440
something like 60 billion
whatever, gallons of water,

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:28.680
which Mexico has illegally used
to supplement its population.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.080
Water is an issue in Mexico--

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:31.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:34.120
JULIAN BEINART: --severe issue.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:34.620
Next.

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.600
This was at the time--

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.150
tourists, $5 million per year.

01:13:44.150 --> 01:13:45.950
It's obviously much more today.

01:13:48.325 --> 01:13:48.825
Next.

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:58.020
Use of the region by La
Jolla High School students--

01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:01.360
use of the region by
Tijuana residence.

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:01.860
Next.

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:11.630
The linear, dense,
arterial street

01:14:11.630 --> 01:14:14.910
of the Mexican environment--

01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:23.995
the isolated shopping center
in the San Diego space.

01:14:23.995 --> 01:14:24.495
Next.

01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:36.940
This is a plaza
in Ciudad Juarez.

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:43.900
This is a view of the
central part of El Paso.

01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:50.920
There's one person, two people
available in the photograph.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:55.840
This is all due to a whole
complex juxtaposition

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:58.380
of urban renewal and so on.

01:14:58.380 --> 01:14:58.880
Next.

01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:10.350
Despite the operation
of two separate cities,

01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:14.250
the daily traffic
volume represents that

01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:17.140
of a unified metropolitan area.

01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:17.640
Next.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.510
This is a happy
picture on the right

01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:28.970
of border guards on
the American side

01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:31.850
on the right playing
against Mexican border

01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:35.190
guards on the left.

01:15:35.190 --> 01:15:36.710
Nobody knows who wins.

01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:40.490
The border is in the air.

01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:40.990
Next.

01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:52.375
Immigrant crossing-- next.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:55.260
Next.

01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:00.180
An Octavio Paz--

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:04.520
Americans come to Mexico to
satisfy their obsessions.

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:12.900
AUDIENCE: There is a
[INAUDIBLE] that is very much

01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:14.900
ingrained in Mexican psyche.

01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:18.890
And it's about the crosses
and the little memorials

01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:21.200
of people that
have died crossing

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:22.730
from Mexico to the States.

01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:23.820
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:25.940
AUDIENCE: They turn up
in places like Arizona.

01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:28.683
They're actually
actively hunted down.

01:16:28.683 --> 01:16:30.100
JULIAN BEINART: I
thought you were

01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:33.290
going to refer to the
6,000 people who were

01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:36.118
killed per annum in Juarez.

01:16:36.118 --> 01:16:37.160
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:41.180
And then it goes on the
other way around in Juarez.

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:44.810
Especially women working
in rural maquilas.

01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:47.200
JULIAN BEINART: In the
maquila industries.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah, in the
maquila industries.

01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:49.450
[INAUDIBLE]

01:16:49.450 --> 01:16:50.720
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:53.180
Apparently, real
estate in Juarez,

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:56.930
according to The
Wall Street Journal,

01:16:56.930 --> 01:17:01.240
is more expensive than in
an American industrial site.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:04.010
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:06.364
JULIAN BEINART: What
accounts for the violence?

01:17:06.364 --> 01:17:07.130
AUDIENCE: What?

01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:09.950
JULIAN BEINART: What
accounts for the violence?

01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:11.000
The 6,000--

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.180
AUDIENCE: There's been
a lot of wild theories,

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:20.720
anywhere from gang to
cults to women trafficking

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:24.090
to the States for
sexual purposes.

01:17:24.090 --> 01:17:28.550
But what is very strong is the
fact that the majority of them

01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:30.058
are women that work in maquilas.

01:17:32.926 --> 01:17:37.575
And most of them are abducted
while on their way to work.

01:17:37.575 --> 01:17:38.450
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:40.130
Sorry, we have to carry on.

01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:44.600
Maquilas are the name given
for American industries which

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:47.230
locate in Mexico, maquiladoras.

01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:48.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:49.850
JULIAN BEINART: Next.

01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:56.660
Here's the native city
Shahjahanabad, 1683 Shah Jahan,

01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:58.820
and so on and so
on, the cantonment,

01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:00.500
and the civil station.

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:03.050
Next.

01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:06.020
The dense native city--

01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:10.160
and the depiction on the
postcard of the British view

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.930
of that city.

01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:14.890
It looks a bit like
Moscow in its early days.

01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:24.690
Everything is seen
from a distance.

01:18:24.690 --> 01:18:27.000
Next.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.070
Here is the calculation
of the amount of air

01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:33.230
you need to be safe.

01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:38.955
Here is the attempt to
ventilate a parade ground.

01:18:38.955 --> 01:18:39.455
Next.

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:45.840
The basilica form,
which allows ventilation

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:49.470
through at upper level--

01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:55.645
and the headdress modeled
after the basilica form.

01:18:55.645 --> 01:18:56.145
Next.

01:19:00.650 --> 01:19:04.310
The layout of the
civil station, this

01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:07.250
is an interesting
cartoon from [INAUDIBLE]..

01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:14.870
Ensign Green is appointed
as junior commissioner

01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:16.940
in [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:22.160
His friends suggest he needs
to get a house on the right.

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.190
The house on the right is
the scientific version,

01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:29.480
above the ground,
ventilation everywhere.

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:33.440
He's determined to build
this kind of house, however.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:38.660
This kind of house negates
all the scientific premises,

01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:46.700
but it has all of the meaningful
elements to which we associate

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:50.230
with formal exposition.

01:19:50.230 --> 01:19:54.470
He hasn't got the money
to build this number two,

01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:58.497
so he ends up with number four,
a native kind of construction

01:19:58.497 --> 01:19:59.330
called the bungalow.

01:20:02.150 --> 01:20:11.780
Next-- from the bungalow
to the various versions

01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:13.570
of construction.

01:20:13.570 --> 01:20:14.070
Next.

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:22.080
The British maintenance of
some of the outdoor practices--

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:30.430
here the playing of garden
games or social events.

01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:33.030
The maidan-- the
space that's left

01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:39.445
between the native settlement
in Calcutta, the veranda.

01:20:39.445 --> 01:20:39.945
Next.

01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:46.245
The final plan--

01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:53.270
Shahjahanabad about on
the north Connaught place,

01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:58.490
a commercial environment
as a stepping stone

01:20:58.490 --> 01:21:00.830
to the New Delhi.

01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:11.760
Next-- many of the
spatial forms used

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:14.550
from the day of the
Persians onwards.

01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:19.820
Next-- Connaught Place.

01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:29.510
Next-- the great Viceroy's
Palace with the chanceries

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:30.560
on either side--

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:33.005
the secretariats, I'm
sorry, on either side.

01:21:37.170 --> 01:21:46.940
Herbert Baker is
regarded as attempting

01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:50.450
to introduce the Indianic
experiment into the [INAUDIBLE]

01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:52.530
system in detail.

01:21:52.530 --> 01:21:53.030
Next.

01:21:56.340 --> 01:22:01.325
Havana-- the Laws of the
Indies plan on the right.

01:22:01.325 --> 01:22:01.825
Next.

01:22:06.130 --> 01:22:07.090
The empty city--

01:22:10.690 --> 01:22:13.535
I'm sorry the slide is
so dark on the left.

01:22:13.535 --> 01:22:14.035
Next.

01:22:20.530 --> 01:22:25.990
1978-- the suburban house
is divided into two.

01:22:28.630 --> 01:22:34.720
And a major attempt is made
to use Eastern European

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:39.155
prefabricated material--

01:22:39.155 --> 01:22:40.405
We'll be through in a second--

01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:48.130
with micro brigade
labor, teams of 33 people

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:53.000
from industry building their own
housing with specialist help.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:53.500
Next.

01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:02.730
Buildings which are
kept, a hut on the left,

01:23:02.730 --> 01:23:12.300
is an attempt to show what Cuba
was like and colonial power.

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:16.590
The building on the
right has only recently

01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:18.780
been opened again.

01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:20.880
This building was closed.

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:24.240
When we were there, it
was considered unsafe.

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:29.220
But in fact, it indicated
the kind of architecture

01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:30.760
which was too personal.

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:31.260
Next.

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:37.550
This is an interesting--

01:23:40.150 --> 01:23:45.070
this is the premises of
the City Bank of New York.

01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:49.750
Just on the wall as you
go beyond these columns,

01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:53.830
there's a plaque which
says, this building

01:23:53.830 --> 01:24:00.380
is now used for the children of
Cuba, not for capitalist use.

01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:04.240
So you maintain the
distinction between what it was

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.660
in the past and the present.

01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:08.920
This is the same version.

01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:11.350
What is this saying?

01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:13.930
The Picadura Valley
on the right is

01:24:13.930 --> 01:24:20.170
a bunch of new rural people
with a Bulgarian television set.

01:24:20.170 --> 01:24:27.390
Next-- Lenin Park and the
super graphics on the right.

01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:34.510
Next-- the use of
powerful political images.

01:24:34.510 --> 01:24:35.650
Next.

01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:37.950
I think that the last.
