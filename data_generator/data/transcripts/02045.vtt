00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.400
PROFESSOR: So now that we've
discussed prevalence and risk

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.650
scenarios, we come to
a very important topic,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.060
which is, when should
you impose the guideline?

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.490
Obviously, when the epidemic
is raging at a very high rate,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.830
it feels out of
control, it's spreading,

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.660
we want to impose the
guideline that we've discussed,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.630
which limits the indoor
reproductive number

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.800
for each space within
some tolerance.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.580
And that would, for example,
give us some number N1

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.860
from the safety
guideline, R N less than

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.250
epsilon, which is
going to be smaller

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.420
than the normal occupancy
of that room for a given

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.640
time and all the other factors
that we've been discussing.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.600
But what happens as the
prevalence of infection

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.140
goes down.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.840
Generically, there must
be some curve like this.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.330
And we'd like to understand
what is the simplest

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
reasonable model we can come
up with that can tell us

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.220
how to relax the approximation?

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.590
So for example, let's think
of a school or a business,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.140
where we typically have a
lot of the same people there

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.120
every day, but some others
are coming and going,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.420
or maybe going home and
getting infected and coming in.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.520
So the rate of infection is low.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.060
So we expect typically the
number of infected people

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.940
is zero or occasionally one.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.960
And as the prevalence
goes down, then we

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.200
start to see that the situation
is getting safer and safer.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.890
So that at a certain point
P1, where we start to say,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.480
you know what we can
actually increase

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.640
the occupancy of the space
with everything else held

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.840
fixed while still wearing masks.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.390
And then we hit the
normal occupancy.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.650
And you might call that
the new normal, where

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.320
we're going about our
business, the room

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.030
is filled with the
typical number of people.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.100
Let's say, the classroom
is back to its normal size.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.900
We don't have any remote
teaching going on.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.380
But we're wearing masks
or taking other factors

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.800
into account, such as higher
ventilation rates, let's say,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.300
open windows.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.710
But then we continue
lowering the prevalence.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.380
There's a certain
point where we get rid

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.670
of those other precautions.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.360
So extra open your windows.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.030
Or more importantly,
the dominant effect

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.100
is the removal of the
mask because we know

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.780
that's a significant factor.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.210
And then you might call that
back to the real normal,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.750
actually, not the new normal.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.890
Where we are back to full
occupancy and really not

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.160
taking any precautions.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.250
That's going to happen at
a rather low prevalence.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.350
But we hope that that
time will eventually come

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.120
and hopefully not so
far in the future.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.829
And I mention here a
very important point

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.110
we've not talked about
yet in this class

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.870
but we should keep in
the back of our minds.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.810
When I talk about
occupancy I'm really

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.770
talking about the number
of susceptible people.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.810
We just saw that in the
last couple of boards.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.850
But the number of
susceptible people

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.050
are really only those that
are not immune to the disease,

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.480
for example, by vaccination.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.110
So as more and more
people become vaccinated,

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.190
then this occupancy number
might-- for example,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.570
let's say, as a
typical occupancy

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.930
will be at 25 people in a class.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.970
As more and more
people are vaccinated,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.650
the number that we
plug in this formula

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.740
here might actually be lower
when we just make decisions

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.620
because there are fewer
and fewer susceptible

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.490
people that are left.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.110
So that's another very important
factor to keep in mind.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.770
Of course, also, vaccination
has the indirect effect

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.440
of lowering the prevalence
that is seen in the population

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.120
as we start to stamp
out the epidemics.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.710
So we also have that effect.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.080
So I won't talk about
that any further now

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.410
but come back to this
calculation based on the risk

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.960
scenario, the second one that
I talked about last time, where

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.450
we take into account prevalence

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.530
So let's look at the three
different cases here.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.850
So the first one is where we
have restricted occupancy.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.870
This is where we've
decided there's

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.180
an N1, which is epsilon
over average beta tau.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.000
So all the physical parameters
are buried in there.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.380
And this is going
to be something

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.500
less than the normal
occupancy, N0.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.430
Now what is the tau we
want to think about?

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.250
Well, if we have a
school or a business,

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.780
this would be the
cumulative time

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.060
that people spend
together to the point

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.520
where the number of days they
spend together is, let's say,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.100
on the order of a week
would be a reasonable number

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.900
to think about.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.670
Because if we write tau is
the typical hours per day.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.810
Time is some kind of
maximum number of days.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.420
This maximum number
of days could

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.350
be set by, for example,
the testing frequency.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.080
For example, here at MIT, we are
testing our entire population

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.520
at least once a week
in order for anyone,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.260
including myself, to be
admitted to the campus.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
And so we are definitely
testing within a week

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.900
and catching new
infections at that rate.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.100
It could also be motivated
by the incubation time, which

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.330
is the time to show symptoms.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.800
And most people will
remove themselves.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.650
And we know that's around 5.5
days, a typically reported

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.150
value.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.280
So again, on the
order of a week.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.520
And there's also, of
course, other ways

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.180
that people are removed
or they recover.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.310
So there's removal
and recovery, which

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.030
is another way that if
you start to go more than,

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.660
let's say, two weeks,
we start to think

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.190
an infected person
that didn't get

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.190
removed then end up in
the hospital has probably

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.950
recovered.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.040
So if we think of a certain
number of days and hours

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.900
per day, that
gives a tau that is

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.560
going to go into this formula.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.860
And actually, I should also
mention that for simplicity

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.080
here, technically this
should be N1 minus 1.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.750
And I can either include that or
not when I do this calculation.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.230
But I'm generally
thinking of N1, which

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.790
is going to be bigger than 1.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.860
So think of an
occupancy of 10 people

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.260
in a classroom, or
something, might be a limit

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.659
that we would be
interested in considering.

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.930
But certainly we can put the
1 in there if we want to.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.600
So now let's ask
ourselves, how would we

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.730
start to reopen the
space once we've

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.680
decided on a safe occupancy
during the greatest

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.430
level of restrictions?

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.230
So that would then
lead us into a phase

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.540
of relaxing restrictions.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.800
And this would
still be with masks.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.750
So keeping in mind that
masks are an essential part

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.750
of achieving a
reasonable occupancy when

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.850
the pandemic is high and
there's a lot of prevalence.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.380
And that we would only start
to relax occupancy first

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.590
before we take away the
suggestion to wear masks.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.570
And that would be
then the last step.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.300
So for relaxing
restrictions, we're

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.540
then going to be interested in
the indoor reproductive number

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.540
being less than now a
rescaled value, which

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.960
would be epsilon over P i Q i
N. And the indoor reproductive

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.700
number, remember, is N minus 1.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:49.050
But it's approximately
N times beta tau.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.130
So I've replaced
again N minus 1 with N

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.930
just to get a simpler formula.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.690
And so notice now here, N is
in both sides of the equation.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.590
If I want to solve for
the value N2, which

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.170
is this yellow curve
here, I'm actually

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.780
going to have to put
the N's on one side

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.130
and take a square root.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:15.050
So my N2 then would
be the square root

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:23.120
of epsilon over beta
tau times P i times Q i.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.980
And remember also,
another approximation

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.590
here is that P i is
definitely much less than 1.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.880
We're looking to limit
a very low prevalence.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.530
And so also therefore, Q i
is basically tending to 1

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.330
because it's 1 minus P i.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.580
And so that factor is
really not that important.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.659
And notice also, epsilon
over beta tau, that's N1.

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:47.780
So N3 is approximately related
to N1 by the square root of N1

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.610
divided by P i.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.770
That's this number here.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.140
So the function prevalence,
this yellow curve,

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.880
is 1 over square
root of prevalence.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.780
And one nice thing about
writing it this way

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.780
is that I can decide
on a reopening protocol

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.940
without actually
redoing my calculation

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.280
with all those complicated
variables, including the risk

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.290
tolerance epsilon, and
all the factors that

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.330
go into beta because
I've lumped them into N1.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.760
What I'm saying here
is that we've already

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.060
done a calculation and decided
to impose a certain occupancy

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.340
restriction on certain
space based on principles

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.220
that we've been
discussing in this course.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.220
But now as prevalence
goes down, according

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.799
to the simple formula,
whenever N2 is bigger than 1--

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:37.070
we would use this if
N2 is bigger than N1.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.260
So basically, when
these two curves cross,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.900
as you get a lower prevalence,
you now switch to two

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.940
and you'll start increasing.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.580
And you will do that
until you get to N0.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.410
This is the relaxing
restrictions.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:09:01.880
So basically, when N2 is bigger,
than we allow this until N2

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.500
equals N1.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.650
And that's this
time here, P, P2.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:10.380
So basically, we start
imposing restrictions at P1.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.360
So basically, we start
relaxing restrictions

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.180
when the prevalence equals P1.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:26.700
That would be when
N2 is equal to N1.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:35.020
And so that would be
when P1 is 1 over N1.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.880
So essentially,
that's when you expect

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.560
to find one infected person.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.350
So this is
approximately 1 over N1.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.590
Up here, when you go
below this, you're saying,

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.930
well, it's actually unlikely
that during the time tau

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.650
we'll even get one
infected person.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.550
And that's when
we start to relax.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.910
So that's the first
crossover point.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.410
And there's a second
crossover point

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:03.130
when this is equal to P2--

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:04.480
sorry, is equal to N0.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.070
That's [INAUDIBLE] P2 is.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.130
And so basically,
P2, which is when

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.560
we would hit the
saturation point and that's

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.720
when we've reopened
in some sense

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.410
to the full normal
situation, that would

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.930
be when N2 is equal to N0.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:22.430
Wait, sorry.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.390
I wrote here N2 equals N1.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.210
Sorry, I meant
when N2 equals N0.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.590
Sorry.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:30.140
That's the time P2 here,
when N2 is equal to N0,

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.340
that's when we cut off.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.140
So this is N0.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.910
And we solve for P i.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:40.440
You can see that we
get N1 over N0 squared.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.510
So that is the place
where I then switch.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.140
And now I'm going to
cap the occupancy at N0.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.680
So maybe to summarize
here, what I would say

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.570
is that the occupancy
should be less

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:05.940
than or equal to N1 for
P i greater than P1.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:16.500
It'll be N2, which depends
on P i for P i between P1

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.580
or P2 and P1.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.170
And then as the
prevalence gets lower,

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:29.180
we go to full occupancy, N0,
when P i is less than P2.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:34.010
So this is basically this
full curve of reopening.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.350
And then the final
decision to make

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.310
is, when do we return
completely to normal

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.230
and take away certain
restrictions we've done?

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:41.730
So here I mentioned masks.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.660
We could also include in
this calculation relaxing

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.000
other restrictions,
such as maybe not having

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.160
the ventilation
on quite so high.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.740
So that would be when
we finally go back

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.350
to no restrictions of any kind.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:57.030
We're back to normal.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:03.800
So this means no masks, no other
precautions, full occupancy.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:10.880
So in this case, R N is going
to be less than epsilon over--

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.910
well, let's see here.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.330
It's the same as before.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.670
We have this P i, N
that we just looked at.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.920
Or technically. times Q i.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.730
But now we have another
factor, P M squared.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.720
Because compared to
the case with no masks,

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.220
we know the bound
in the guidelines.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:34.750
So the effect of beta just
gets rescaled by P M squared.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.490
So technically
that's in R N here.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.470
But now we have
this extra factor.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.770
You think of it like a
rescaling of epsilon.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.710
And so what that's
going to do for us then

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:57.980
is that there's another curve
that goes like this, which

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:02.000
is just like this one but it's
shifted by a factor P M cubed--

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.110
or P M squared, sorry.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:09.790
Which is like the case where you
had-- so this is like no masks.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.710
It's like the N2 with no masks.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:17.600
And the other curve
is with masks.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.160
And there's a
rescaling factor, which

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.650
really has to do with the
remediation that you've done.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:30.110
And in this case, P3 would then
just be P M squared times P2.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.480
So if our P M is
a factor of 10%,

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.100
let's say, masks are letting
10% of infectious droplets

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.740
get through, the P M squared
might be a factor of 100.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.510
So then we would wait
to the prevalence

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:45.290
is 100 times smaller before we
finally allow people to remove

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.510
masks and be at full occupancy.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.370
And you could make a
similar calculation

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.460
for other types of restrictions.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.590
And in fact, you can
calculate such a curve

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:59.000
for a given room, given
scenario of human behavior

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.590
and interventions, such as
filtration or ventilation.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.290
And what the theory allows
you to do is to, of course,

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.790
recalculate N1.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.950
And then you can
recalculate N2 as well.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.550
And so you can say, well,
I don't like this curve.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.610
I would like to try to
reopen my school sooner.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.210
How would I do that?

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.650
Well, I know that if I
make various interventions,

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.060
I can raise the pink curve.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.120
So I could end up somewhere
here, let's just say.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:32.190
This might be with
safety interventions.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.860
Actually, one such
intervention, by the way,

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:38.870
is masks themselves.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.670
Because if I follow this
curve all the way down here,

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.120
there's some curve
down here, which

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.780
is no masks, which is the
safety guideline with no masks.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.720
And if I turn on masks, I go up.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.020
But when I make that
intervention, also P2, notice,

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.200
scales also like N1.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.550
And so that's actually
moving in this direction.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.160
And so I essentially
move this yellow curve.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.880
And so I'm now
going to say, well,

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.020
with a different
set of interventions

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.920
I can make the room safer.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.920
And what that does, it gives
me more people in the room.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.220
But it also means
that I change when

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.470
I make the decision to reopen.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.210
And in particular,
I can get myself

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.030
to full occupancy at
a higher prevalence

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:24.200
because the room is
actually now made safer.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.760
So I note it.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.630
But on the other hand, this
switch here was at 1 over N1.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.910
So this part
shrinks a little bit

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.520
as this ultimately goes
up to full occupancy.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.520
So basically, I think compared
to the current situation

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.520
or the typical situation
where policymakers are making

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.640
decisions based on something
like the six-foot rule

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.910
and a somewhat arbitrary
feeling about what is a high

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.760
prevalence-- is it 1%, is 0.1%--

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.460
and we decide, OK, now
we can close our schools

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.610
or reopen our schools or
set the occupancy at half,

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.220
the guideline tells you
how to set occupancy

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:06.530
for of the worst case
scenario, when the pandemic is

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.200
very prevalent in society.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.420
But now also, through these
kinds of calculations,

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.240
we can make rational
decisions about how to reopen.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.050
I'm not advocating necessarily
for the exact formulas

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:18.310
we find on the board here.

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.730
But the principles
I'm showing you

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:23.630
could lead to quantitative
and scientifically justifiable

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:27.650
ways of taking a specific
space and a specific usage

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.680
of that space and deciding how
to close, as prevalence goes

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.320
up, and reopen, as
prevalence goes down,

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.510
including ultimately
returning to normal

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.110
and removing masks and all
other forms of precaution

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.400
as the epidemic disappears.
