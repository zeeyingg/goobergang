00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.980
PROFESSOR: So now, let's start
talking about airborne disease

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.050
transmission, thinking
especially of viral diseases

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.330
where we expect the
transmission to occur

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.510
through aerosol droplets or
at least smaller droplets,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.880
which may sediment
but are going to be

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.820
suspended in the air for a
significant amount of time.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.300
So the first approximation
of such a situation

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.750
is to assume a
well-mixed room, meaning

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.910
that the air in the
room is well mixed.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.750
And even if there is, let's
say, one person who's infected

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.010
and that infected person is
breathing, talking, singing,

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.500
respiring, and exhaling
infected aerosol droplets,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.580
then these droplets start
to spread around the room.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.099
And they do so
because the room is--

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.860
and we assume that the
room is well mixed.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.990
So even though,
as I've sketched,

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.150
there's certainly going to
be a higher concentration

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.330
of the droplets near the
infected person, that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.260
is there are significant
airflows in the room, which

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.800
induce mixing.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.620
That is partly driven
by the flow of fresh air

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.820
through the room.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.730
Typically, we may have
some forced ventilation

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.289
coming through ducts with fans.

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:26.820
There could be open windows.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.390
And even when a
room is not open,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.350
meaning that the windows
are closed, maybe even

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.759
the door is closed,
there's always

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.610
some leakage and exchange of
air with the outside, which

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.680
typically happens on
the order of hours.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.200
So there's always at least
some kind of flow rate.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.539
Also, there's a movement
of people in the room,

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.850
and there's also breathing
itself, which basically

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.120
imparts momentum to
the fluid and causes

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.289
swirling motions of the fluid.

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.270
So the situation actually
is more like this

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.080
where there's these flows
that are generated either

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.820
by the ventilation,
by the movement

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.280
and respiration of the
people, also by thermal flows.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.940
So when you're breathing, the
air coming out of your lungs

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.220
is warmer, and
that tends to rise.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.130
But, also, if it's very
humid air and very warm air,

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.370
then actually the weight of
all the humidity and droplets

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.750
that come with
air could actually

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.530
cause some settling as well.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.950
So you have all these
different processes going on.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.990
And your first
approximation, just

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.110
assume that those lead to
a well-mixed situation.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.829
And so we will proceed to
analyze disease transmission

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.390
from that assumption,
and then we'll

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.570
come back at the
end to consider what

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.640
would happen if there
are actually fluctuations

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.730
and think about the distance
from an infected person

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.190
and how that might play
a role in departures

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.540
from the predictions of
a well mixed room.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.370
OK.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.250
So defining some
variables, then.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.270
We'll let C of t
be the, basically,

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.550
infectiousness of
the air, if you will.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.800
But more specifically,
if we think of virus,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.960
it'll be the virions
per air volume.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.340
So they're contained
in droplets.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.640
And later we will consider
what size droplets

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.480
they may be contained
in, but for now, let's

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.310
just average over
everything and say there's

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.980
some concentration in the air.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.290
We have a production rate of
these infectious droplets,

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.720
which can be broken
down into many terms.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.510
So this is the
production rate, so this

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.500
is the number of virions
per time that are produced.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.610
So that would be Qb is
our breathing flow rate.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.070
So that's basically the volume
of exhaled air per breath

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.700
cycle, so that's how much
air is being pushed out

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.630
in your breathing.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.490
And this is typically--

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:07.790
ranges from 0.5 up to around
3 meters cubed per hour.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.980
So 0.5 is a typical
resting breathing rate.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.990
And, in fact, even
if you're just

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.089
kind of calmly speaking and
sitting in a room breathing

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.510
through your nose, that'll be
your typical breathing rate.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.430
But if you start exercising
and start exerting yourself,

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.020
then that could go
up to maybe around 3.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.200
And so that's the typical
range of the breathing rate.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.770
The next thing we need is Nd
is the droplet concentration,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.060
so this is the number
of drops per air volume.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.070
So that's sort of the
number density of drops.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.200
So if I have various
visualization techniques,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.620
I can actually see all the
droplets, and I can count them.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.070
I can say how many droplets
are in a given volume.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.990
The next thing is I need
the volume of a drop.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.990
So as I mentioned,
of course there

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.540
are different drop
volumes, and we'll

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.200
come back to assessing the
effects of a droplet size

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.310
distribution.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.230
But for simplicity,
why don't we just take

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.200
these sort of average size
drops that we discussed

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.700
coming from respiration,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.970
And that might be a number
around 1 micron in size.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.790
And there's a volume that
corresponds with that, which,

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.840
of course, is the
4/3 pi r cubed where

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.340
we assume for now only one
size r for all drops just

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.570
for the moment.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.930
So now we have the
volume here, so now

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:37.270
we sort of what is the
total amount of drops.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.130
So the next thing
we need now is Cv.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:47.020
Cv will be the number of virions
per liquid volume or per drop

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.650
volume, so there's certain-- so
if I could take the pure liquid

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.810
in the drop-- let's
say it's mucus--

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.730
and it's been coming
out of your pharynx

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.860
and has sort of fragmented and
taken some virions with it,

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.010
then that would be the
viral load, essentially.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.670
Sometimes that's
another word for this.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.800
And the viral load
varies with time.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.820
So when you first get infected,
at first the viral load

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.550
is very low in the fluids
that you're breathing out.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.080
And then that raises up.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.400
And during the period when
you're most infectious,

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.820
which for COVID-19
and SARS-CoV-2 virus,

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.600
that time ends up being
around a week or so when you--

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.060
well, within a few days, you
reach the peak infectiousness.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.510
And then when you're
at the peak viral load,

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.100
this ends up being about
10 to the ninth virions

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.250
per milliliter of
fluid when you're

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:48.340
at your peak infectiousness
for SARS-CoV-2.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.750
OK.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.700
So just to give you a sense,
but of course, a lot of times

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:55.659
it might be less than that.

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:57.280
But if you're very
infected individual,

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.450
that's kind of a worst case.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.410
And we're going to be
interested in calculating

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.630
safety guidelines and
probabilities of transmission,

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.290
so to be conservative,
it's good to have

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.700
an idea of how big this
number can actually be.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.370
So what we just
calculate here-- so,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.570
basically, this Nd, Vd
is the amount of drop

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.460
or liquid volume per air
volume, so that's essentially

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.070
the volume fraction of liquid.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.530
When we go times Cv,
we're essentially

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:26.140
getting the number of virions
in the air per volume of air.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.580
And then Qv is the
volume per time,

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.730
so this is basically
virions per time.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.510
And then one other factor
that we should also

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.120
consider is what
if we're actually

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.930
filtering those droplets
right at the source?

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.980
And that'll be the case
if you're wearing a mask.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.340
So this is an important
quantity we'll come back to.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:55.380
This will be the mask
penetration probability

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.100
for a droplet.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.080
So this is-- of course
is size dependent,

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.250
but we'll come back to that.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.930
But for the moment, we're just
saying it's one drop size.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.220
And so for the size of drops
of interest, we're asking,

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.670
do they go through the mask?

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:12.030
So 1 minus Pm is also called
the filtration efficiency.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.520
Yes.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.590
So a very good mask might be
99% of droplets are filtered.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.190
A very poor cloth
covering might be

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.440
10% of droplets are
filtered, and we'll come back

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.190
to that in just a moment.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.630
So this here is our
production rate capital P.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.390
And already with the variables
that we've written down here,

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:42.510
we can write down a mass
balance for the virions.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.200
So virions are being produced.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.450
They end up in these droplets.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.200
The droplets are being swept out
of the room at a flow rate Q,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.120
and the room has a volume
V. So if I write down

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.420
just the conservation of
mass, making sure that I'm not

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.370
losing any virus yet--

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.200
I'm not allowing them
to stick to the walls

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.880
or do anything else
just yet but just

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.400
looking at the mass balance of
one infected person breathing

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:03.900
out.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.040
This is, I should say,
production rate per infector,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.520
or an infected person.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.610
So if there are more
infected people,

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.420
then you'll have this
production rate for each person.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.630
They also might be at
different stage of the disease,

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.290
so maybe the viral
load will be a little

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.650
different for each person.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.720
But let's not worry about
such details right now.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.030
We want to keep things general.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.620
So for the mass
balance, we write down

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.790
the total number of
virions in the room

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.180
and how that changes in time.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.250
So that'll be the concentration
per room air volume, which

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.420
is well-mixed times the
volume of the room per time.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.250
So this is the change in the
number of virions per time,

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.220
and that can change in two ways.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.090
One, we have the production P.
So for every infected person,

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.650
we have production
P, but this will be--

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:50.940
I should say virions per
air volume per infector.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.780
So if we want to think about
having multiple infected people

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.040
in the room, we can always
just basically increase

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:56.880
this concentration.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.370
A well-mixed room, it doesn't
matter where people are placed.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.160
You're just getting
more and more droplets,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.030
and it's assumed to be mixed.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.600
So we produce at a rate P,
but then the outdoor flow

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.940
is taking away
droplets and, hence,

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:14.520
removing virions at a rate
Q. So we have a Q times

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.910
C removal rate.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.330
So this is our equation.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.970
So let's divide through by V.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:28.420
So we can write this
as dC dt is P/V minus,

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.260
and then Q/V I'll
write as lambda a C.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:44.140
So lambda a, which is Q/V,
this is the outdoor air change

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.670
or exchange rate.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.540
So that is the rate at which
the entire volume of the room

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.510
is replaced with outdoor air.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.320
So the outdoor air
is refreshing the air

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.330
in the room at
this rate Q/V. OK.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.670
And so that's what appears here.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.210
And if you compare these two,
you can see that this is dC dt.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.630
This is C times lambda, so
lambda is units of 1 over time.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.620
It's a t.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.450
This is also sometimes called--

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:17.100
the ACH is air changes per hour
if you write it in per hour.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.970
So that's a typical way
that this is written.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.850
And, in fact, while
we're just talking about,

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.510
this is a very
important concept.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:33.020
So lambda a is around 0.3 per
hour, so roughly every 3 hours

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.580
for a closed room.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:41.760
So closed room or what you might
call natural ventilation where

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.770
there's no attempt to
deliver air to that room.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:47.730
Of course, this number
depends on the tightness

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.610
of the construction and whether
there is cracks in the windows,

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.530
whether doors are being
opened to the hallway.

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.320
So, of course, that's
not a perfect number,

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.140
but that's a rough estimate
how quickly air is escaping

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.640
from typical construction.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.620
But then it can be, also,
in a different range.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.760
And this a very important
parameter for the theory,

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.230
so let's pause just to look
at some of the numbers.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.440
So it's in the range--
it's typically 3 to 8

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.900
per hour for
mechanical ventilation.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.020
So this could be--

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.690
it could be open windows
with fans blowing in and out,

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.840
which might give you 3
or even 6 on this number.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.520
It could also be a
ventilation system,

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.380
which is delivering
fresh air to the space.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.920
And for typical classrooms,
offices, and even homes,

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.530
this is a typical range.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.160
So for example, if
it's 3, then that

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.100
would be every 20 minutes
the room gets its air

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.110
to be fully exchanged.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.630
But of course, if
you have situations

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.670
where you need to have
better air quality

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.920
and you have more risk
of, say, transmission

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.030
of disease or passage of
pollutants or contaminants,

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.010
then we need higher values.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.890
A typical number in the
United States for hospitals

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.810
is 18 air changes per hour.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.030
And then it can be even larger.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.440
So if you have a
laboratory, which

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.100
is dealing with toxic
chemicals or even,

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.790
let's say, virus and
pathogens, then you

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.830
need even higher air changes.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:26.600
And typical rates, then,
can be as high as 20 to 30

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:33.180
for labs that are dealing
with toxins of various types

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:33.680
because--

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.390
and any airborne toxins
have to be quickly removed

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.850
so that if they
happen to be leaked

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.620
into the air from your
experiment or from your hood,

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.970
they need to be
quickly sucked out.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.500
Also, even parking
lots where you

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.980
have cars in an enclosed space
that are generating carbon

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.570
monoxide and other fumes, which
have to be quickly rushed out,

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.640
parking lots tend to have
this number around 30.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.690
So that's a full air change of
the entire room in 2 minutes.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.020
That's a very fast flow rate.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.350
So this is kind of the
range of this lambda a.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:03.420
That's, obviously, a
very important parameter.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.300
So let's now solve
this equation here.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.450
So, first of all, you
can see when dC dt is 0,

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:13.190
then the steady state is
just P over lambda a V.

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:16.400
But if I write Q
equals lambda a V,

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.350
I can see the steady
state is just P/Q.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.320
So I can write the
solution like this--

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.740
that if we're given time
dependence, that the P/Q is

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.230
the steady state.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:32.270
And if I started out with
my initial condition,

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:36.260
was that C of 0 equals 0.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.710
So let's say time equals 0 is
when the infected person enters

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.110
the room and starts breathing.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:43.720
And then there's
a mixing process

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.350
and there's a build-up
of concentration

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:49.700
until there's a balance between
the production of virus,

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.660
virions, or infectious air and
the removal of infectious air

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.310
by the ventilation.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.580
And that gives you this ratio
P/Q. But the way the relaxation

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.720
happens, though--

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.700
if you balance these
two terms here,

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.500
that's just an exponential
decay with a decay rate lambda

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.180
a, so e to the minus lambda a t.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.560
So this is basically the way
the concentration builds up.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.150
If I plot this, then at a
certain time here, which

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.590
is sometimes called Tres--

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.320
in chemical engineering,
these kinds of models

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.480
are commonly used to
design chemical reactors.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.150
In fact, this kind of model
is in chemical engineering

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.200
called a continuous
stirred-tank reactor.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.750
We don't worry
about the details,

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.110
but we have a flow
of some reactants

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.700
and various chemical
species going into a tank.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.880
We assume it's well
mixed and then it leaves,

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.690
and this is the mass
balance that we use.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:45.500
And the residence time,
Tres, is the inverse

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.040
of lambda a in this case.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.270
So that is the--

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:50.830
as soon as you know the volume
and the ventilation flow rate,

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.640
there's a typical speed
going through here.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.070
And the time that
fresh air spends

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.560
in the room interacting with
all the droplets and people

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.070
and then leaving, carrying some
of those droplets, is this.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.200
And in a simple model
like this, it's just

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:10.070
an exponential relaxation at
that time scale approaching

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:17.720
the steady state, which is P/Q.
So there's always that kind

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.030
of balance which is reached.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.720
Now let's also ask
ourselves, briefly at

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.320
this point, how reasonable is
the well-mixed approximation?

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.870
We will come back to this and
analyze it much more carefully,

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.320
taking into account all the
different processes I described

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.330
at the beginning, including
breathing, motion of people.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.350
But let's just think about the
motion caused by the airflow

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.930
itself.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.830
So in the case of
mechanical ventilation

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.280
where that flow rate can
be sometimes rather high,

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.150
that can be a significant
source of mixing in the system.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.570
And the way we'll
think about that

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.360
is by writing down the
typical velocity of the air

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.080
due to the outdoor air flow.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.230
That is Q. We can write it as
either Q divided by the area,

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.260
so some kind of representative
area of the room.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.960
It could be, let's
say, the floor area,

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.589
but depending on the
shape of the room,

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:09.810
it might be a little bit
different value than that.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:14.030
We can also write this as
Q times H over V, where

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.680
V is the volume
of the room and H

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.140
is some characteristic height,
like, for example, a ceiling

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.470
height of the room.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:20.240
OK.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:26.900
So this is the mean
airspeed due to ventilation.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.530
And we'll come back to a
more deeper investigation

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.770
of these fluid
mechanics of the room.

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.950
But as a first example of what
we'll be interested in is we'd

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:44.870
like to calculate the Reynolds
number due to the airflow.

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.490
So I'll put a subscript a there.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:52.380
And that is the typical velocity
times a length scale, which

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.270
could be, let's say,
the height of the room

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.130
or some linear length
scale of the room,

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.290
depending on the
direction of the airflow.

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:02.250
And then the kinematic
viscosity of air,

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:04.500
so I'll write that as new a.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.000
So this here is the
Reynolds number.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:17.020
This is basically telling us how
important inertia of the fluid

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:21.760
is compared to viscous stresses
that slow the fluid down.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.540
So, basically, it
tells us how quickly--

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.380
how much of a tendency
there is for momentum

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.960
to be carried in the
fluid, which then

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.610
leads to sort of swirling
motions and complex flows,

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.260
as I've sketched here.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.650
And this new a is the
viscosity of the air

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.560
that we've already talked about
when looking at Stokes flow

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.390
but divided by the
density of the air.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.890
OK.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.660
So that's the
kinematic viscosity.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.840
And for air, the
kinematic viscosity

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:54.360
is 1.5 times 10 to the minus
5 meters squared per second.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.710
And so if I plug these
numbers in and I pick,

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:03.700
let's say, a typical ceiling
height of maybe a few--

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.070
I think this-- if the H
is of order 3 meters--

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:12.160
or 2 meters might
be a typical scale.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.120
Just to get an approximate
sense of the scale here,

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:21.670
the Reynolds number will be
varying from around 50 or tens,

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.420
up to 5,000, which would
be in the case of very fast

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.300
ventilation like the 30 ACH.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:37.340
So this would be if we have
0.3 ACH up to around 30 ACH.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.640
That's just a rough number.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.740
And from fluid
mechanics, we know

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.200
the significance of these
large Reynolds numbers

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.940
is that the flows really do
look a bit like I've shown here.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.110
So, basically, when the air
is sitting in the room--

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:51.730
you know this from
looking at the smoke

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.460
from a candle or other flows
that you can visualize--

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.270
it's not just a sort
of uniform flow.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.910
But instead there are all
these sort of plumes and swirls

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.260
and vortices.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.900
And when the Reynolds number
is on the order of tens,

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.570
when there is a motion,
it tends to lead

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.460
to a shedding of a vortex and
to some kind of swirling flows.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.300
And when the Reynolds
number gets up as high

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.940
as several thousand,
then in most geometries

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.190
that starts to lead to a
transition to turbulent flow.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.640
And that's when
the flow is getting

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.910
so complicated there are
eddies of different sizes

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.980
and very rapid mixing.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.780
So I just wanted
to show this right

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.430
at the beginning
of the discussion

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.260
to point out that
for typical flows

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.120
we would expect
that there is going

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.160
to be a decent amount
of mixing occurring just

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.680
because of the ventilation.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.060
And now if you add to the fact
that people are breathing,

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.860
imparting momentum
to the fluid, we

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.970
have people moving and other
kinds of activities in a room,

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.940
that all of those
processes lead to giving us

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:50.400
a reasonable assumption
of a well-mixed room.
