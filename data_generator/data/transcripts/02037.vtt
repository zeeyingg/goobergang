00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.720
PROFESSOR: So in order to use
our results for the analysis

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.270
of the well-mixed room
into the safety guideline,

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.650
let me just
summarize the results

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.430
for the general case of
transient build-up of aerosols

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.460
in the room and the
associated transmission.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.800
So here is the result
that we derived

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.960
earlier, which is
that the transmission

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.170
rate as a function of time is
an integral over all the droplet

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.370
sizes.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.510
And then you have here the
mask filtration factor,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.460
which depends on size P_m.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.050
You have the
breathing rate Q_b that

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.460
comes in squared because there's
one person breathing out,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.780
another person breathing in.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.390
You got the volume of the room.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.250
You have here the
relaxation rate

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.780
for the concentration
of aerosol in the room,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.770
which here is given by four
factors for ventilation,

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.090
sedimentation, filtration,
and deactivation.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.460
And then for the
production of aerosols,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.330
there's this n_q(r), which is
the number of exhaled infection

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.570
quanta per volume,
per air volume leaving

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.110
the breath per radius
because it's still resolved

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.850
by the different droplet radii.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.350
And this has several
contributions.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.180
It has n_d(r), which is the
distribution of droplet sizes.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.490
V_d(r) is the volume
of each droplet.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.890
Depends on the
respiratory activity.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.000
C_v is the viral load,
which we are typically

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.490
assuming is near the
maximum when we're concerned

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.110
about controlling spreading.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.500
And C_i(r) is the
infectivity per virion,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.890
which we have discussed before
also may have a size dependence

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.130
and is most likely higher
in the aerosol droplets.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.750
So that's the general solution.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.330
And the safety guideline
we just discussed

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.050
has in it the time average beta,
so beta with the two brackets,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.360
which is the integral in time
of beta divided by the time tau.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.890
So you break that
into two parts.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.240
So we integrate this here.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.130
The one here is--

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.780
it gives you a
steady state term,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.300
and the interval is
shown right here.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.639
And that's basically the--

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:14.500
ultimately the average
that remains, but initially

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.850
when the infected person
first walks in the room,

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.130
there's a time to build up
the concentration, which only

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.800
lowers the transmission rate.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.590
So the average
transmission rate is always

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.670
less than the steady state.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.120
You're approaching
the steady state

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.300
from below because you
need the time to build up

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.420
those droplets.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.050
And so the DELTA beta here,
which is that correction,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.520
takes the following form.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.820
What you can do is bring the
interval over time and switch

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.340
places with the
integration over r

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.340
and do the time integral
inside the integral.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.890
And so that allows you to
get-- instead of lambda_c here,

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.660
you get lambda_c
squared, and you

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.620
get the following expression
for the DELTA beta.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.500
It may not be obvious
looking at it,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.860
but if you take a look
at tau going to 0,

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.800
this expression leads
to just beta bar.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.870
So DELTA beta of 0 is
beta bar, and that's

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.730
because if you take
this exponential here

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.690
and you go to small times, you
can linearize that and find

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.470
its lambda_c t.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.430
So it factors--
cancels one factor

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.450
of lambda_c, one factor
of tau, and you end up

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.840
with just a single
lambda_c as above.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.220
So what that means is that
the average beta, which

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.860
we're plotting here, as a
function of the time tau

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.230
starts out at 0.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.140
It ramps up and then eventually
approaches a steady state,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.520
and here's the full solution.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.900
So all the
information that we've

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.810
talked about before in terms
of filtration, sedimentation,

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.020
other phenomena in
the well-mixed room

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.440
are all included
in this framework

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.630
and can then be put into
the safety guideline

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.440
to derive a general
safety guideline that

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.500
has all of the physics
that we want in there

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.250
and allows you to define a
safe occupancy for a room.
