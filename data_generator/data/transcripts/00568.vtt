00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.790
JULIAN BEINART: We
start the last section.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.840
We have about-- there's
about a month left.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.260
And I want to try
to deal with as much

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.180
of the current
understanding of urbanism

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.150
as we can squeeze into it.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.640
My focus will be very much
on architecture and urbanism

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:06.570
and not much on urban economics
or urban social policy.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.730
This class is really about the
former cities, and we have to--

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.290
I will be relying
for today's class

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.775
on a number of people's writing.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.050
But if you want, in
the required reading,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.500
there's a piece from
Eric Mumford's book.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.700
I don't know if you know or
ran into the book at all.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.640
The CIAM discourse on
urbanism 1928 to 1960,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.110
it's an excellent book.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.520
Eric Mumford, I think,
did his PHD here

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.250
and teachers in St. Louis
at Washington University.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.470
For those who don't know
what CIAM stands for,

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.720
it was the assembly
of modern architects

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.620
starting in
[? Lazzaro's ?] in 1928

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.540
and meeting regularly until
they disbanded in 1960.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.230
A great deal of
information comes

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.060
from the attitudes of these
people towards modernism,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.500
and I will quote from
a number of them.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.530
My own connection is
that I studied history

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.830
at [? Gearheart ?]
Harvard and the Giedeon--

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.190
Sigfried Gideon, who wrote
Space, Time and Architecture--

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.830
probably the most important
book of modern architecture--

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.450
and was a key figure with
Corbusier and [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.740
to become dean at
Harvard in CIAM.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.320
Whatever [? happened ?]
to just a fragment of some

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.600
of the topics.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.910
My ambition today is
to give you some idea

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.190
of the content of modernism.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.500
So I've broken it down
into 10 categories,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:42.180
or 10 thematic ideas, which
are part of modern urbanism,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.930
or were set forth as ideas which
were important to urbanism.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:58.530
The second page deals with the
response to [INAUDIBLE] plan

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.210
in Barcelona by modern urbanism.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.100
The third page is
a page of drawing

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.710
by Gropius characterizing
how you delimit

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.570
the space between buildings
by virtue of light,

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.980
or the presence of light.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.140
How it didn't strike Gropius
that, in Manhattan, nobody

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.340
cares about which direction
your building faces?

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.380
I suppose, if you
have a lot of money,

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.000
you can choose a
building that faces south

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.880
or your view faces
south as you can

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.075
choose the building which faces
onto Central Park or whatever.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.680
But that's an option
for very few people.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.025
I don't know people in
Manhattan talking about light.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.306
Now what is the--

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.870
how is this diagram
of any use to anybody?

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.780
AUDIENCE: Well, I mean, it is--

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.635
I know people in
Manhattan that talk about.

00:05:16.635 --> 00:05:18.760
Like, people still
[? renting ?] private apartments

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.238
there are curious about
the light it gets.

00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:22.113
JULIAN BEINART: Good.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:22.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.110
And I guess if you're thinking
more about rather than design

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.830
of building but design
of streets, you know,

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.070
this diagram could
be useful then.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.170
JULIAN BEINART: Yes.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.370
Gropius didn't know that,
in the early town planning

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.670
legislation of Manhattan,
light to the streets

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.800
was always taken into account.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.810
The fact is a good thesis
done by a British women

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.300
a few years ago looking
at that phenomenon

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.210
that sidewalks were always
important in the judgment

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.505
of rules about tall buildings
in Manhattan unlike Tokyo.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:16.530
Tokyo, it's very seldom that
you find overwhelming density

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.000
on any of the major
streets in Manhattan.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:30.690
Part of my theory is that a
grid system articulates people

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.660
in different ways than
linear systems do.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.480
And there's not only one
main street in Manhattan.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:49.790
It prevails as a grid system,
but it's not true in Tokyo

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:58.850
where densities on street level
are so overwhelming that you

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.050
can't walk in the opposite
direction to traffic

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.960
at 6 o'clock in the
evening particularly trying

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.550
to get your subway station.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.790
This is city stuff.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:22.430
But Gropius was a strange man.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.280
He came to speak in our class
at Harvard in Gideon's class.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.590
Let me just finish
going through this.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.850
The next page is something
that we'll go through a little

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.620
carefully together.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:51.440
It's David Harvey's
contrast between modernity

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.950
and postmodernity.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.280
I don't agree with
the term postmodern.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.100
Postmodern really
applies to the styling

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.530
of architecture and literature.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:10.700
And mostly it doesn't have
much counterpart in urbanism.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.610
The next page is one
of the [? existing ?]

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:18.905
minimum systems that CIAM were
very preoccupied with that

00:08:18.905 --> 00:08:25.910
was trying to deduce the minimum
amount of space for family

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:31.970
along with the notion that
minima would contribute

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.250
to the problem of size--

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.460
not size of unit but
size of population.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:45.370
The next page is
a summary of 1930

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.460
versus 1950 in CIAM discussion.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.310
I'll go through that
with you as well.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.270
What is extraordinary about
Gideon's class at Harvard

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.900
was the absence of what
we've been spending

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:09.570
all our time on dealing with
the origins of modernism

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.480
from 1750 onward.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.520
There was no notion that there
had been changes in demography.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:25.280
You'll recall my quoting
the British historian,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.850
[? Llewellyn ?] in saying
that modernism starts

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:35.150
with the increase in the
life expectancy of old people

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:40.130
and the decrease in
infant mortality.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.530
People like Malthus
along the way--

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:49.610
these are fundamental aspect
of urbanism in my mind.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.490
Gideon was only
interested in two--

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.550
first of all, he
hated the 19th century

00:09:55.550 --> 00:10:01.180
because it didn't produce any
architecture of significance.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.850
Gideon would fly
in from Switzerland

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.710
to give our lectures.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:10.240
And he'd say on Sunday afternoon
he walked around Boston

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:15.820
and looked at the terrible
neoclassical furniture

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.210
in the windows of the
department stores.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:23.260
He couldn't understand
why modern furniture

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.600
wasn't available in Boston.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:31.510
Of course it was available, but
it wasn't particularly popular.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:35.101
But instead of
talking about his--

00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:39.500
for Gideon, modernism
in architecture

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.510
had two important 19th
century ancestries.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:48.430
One was in the
adventure of painting--

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.310
the fact that painting
in impressionism

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.950
took account of lack of light--

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:57.220
according to him, took
account of the lack of light

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.460
in the industrial city
and through pointillism

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:06.700
and through opening up
the canvas to light,

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.180
a preoccupation
that Corbusier also

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:16.210
with his [INAUDIBLE] therapeutic
interests emphasized.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:20.770
The second one was the
advent of modern engineers.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:25.540
Gideon spoke endlessly about
[? Myer's ?] building bridges

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.580
in Switzerland.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:33.670
And there were two
themes to modernism

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:40.840
which architecture had
bypassed in the 19th century.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:46.990
Later on, the history of
London, or Paris, or Haussmann,

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:53.890
or [? Engels ?] in Manchester
of the growth of population

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:58.330
because the taking over
by the state of many

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.980
of the social
functions of the church

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.590
that the advent
of social housing

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:09.850
by the state for the first
time in history and so on

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.590
and so on and so on.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.680
It was just a blank.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.610
And much of urbanism
in architecture

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:23.680
has followed that
style of rhetoric

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:28.120
that you skip from the 18th
century to the 21st century.

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.350
Whereas my argument, I
hope I've convinced you

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:39.070
that the 19th century
as significant

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.755
in our understanding
a number of issues.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.560
That is still relevant.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:54.390
Anyway, what I'd like to do is
just go through these 10 items

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.945
and make some comments on
each and quote from sources.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:02.615
The first is the
scientific origin.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:12.000
There was a sense that
science was emerging

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.700
in a way which
could not only play

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.390
a role in individual
design decision

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:26.580
but provide a collective
understanding, which

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.650
art perhaps didn't have.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:39.860
For instance, many
architects of the time

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.790
adopted Venetian nurturing of
an elite community of artists

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:48.380
who would discover spiritual
truth in the uniting of art

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:55.130
and science and then reveal the
truth to the rest of mankind.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.260
So it's both art
and science that

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.940
are necessary for an
elite group of thinkers

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.320
to come to a conclusion.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.960
Man brings into
place unlimited power

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.920
for the calculating, planning,
and melding of all things.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.600
Science says research is an
absolutely necessary form

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.050
of this establishing
of self in the world.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.330
It is one of the
pathways upon which

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:29.095
the modern age reaches toward
fulfillment of its essence.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:42.815
The [INAUDIBLE]
scientific study of space.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:55.990
Corbusier writes in
the CIAM conference

00:14:55.990 --> 00:15:00.130
in Frankfurt in 1929.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.250
He writes about the [? minima ?]
house problem in his book.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.400
The talks stretched the
biological nature of dwelling,

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.140
the poverty and
the insufficiency

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.840
of traditional
technique, the need

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.020
for standardization,
industrialization,

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.250
and tailorization--

00:15:31.815 --> 00:15:35.090
a phenomenon with modern
architectural science

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.485
[INAUDIBLE] the exact.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.730
It's curious that
this notion of science

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:49.920
really was in contrast to what
science was dealing with--

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:55.170
uncertainty, relativity,
stochastic ideas,

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.480
indeterminacy--

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.920
at a time when these
people were trying

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.990
to use science as an ally
in making formal decisions

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:08.110
about urbanism.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:20.450
In Germany-- I mentioned
their names before--

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:30.170
the great theorist, Baumeister
1833 to 1917, his book in 1876

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:32.600
credited with
orienting city building

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.060
around traffic problems.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.970
Traffic engineering, or
the system of movement,

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:45.710
would be seen as a
scientific measure

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:50.990
whereas today we are interested
in relativistic relationships

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:55.940
between public transportation
and private transportation.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:59.960
In this discourse of modernism,
public transportation

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.623
doesn't appear to have been
a phenomenon worth taking

00:17:04.623 --> 00:17:05.165
into account.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.010
[? Stuben, ?] the traffic
systems and direction flow

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.544
form the basis for the
construction of cities.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:23.290
Germany played a role in the
development of public health--

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.155
also in the origins of zoning.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:41.330
Learning was a necessary device
to maintain some sense of order

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.000
and to protect the
general public in a period

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.015
of uncontrolled growth
and [? on ?] [? bridge ?]

00:17:47.015 --> 00:17:50.490
[? learned ?] speculation.

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.310
Well, that sounds very German.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:06.840
But this notion that
science could be an ally

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:13.350
was very deeply rooted in the
idea of the scientific study

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.910
of space.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:30.790
The second was the breaking
up of life into categories.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:36.790
CIAM 4 in Athens
published the charter

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:45.010
of Athens, which became
the subject of much debate.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.920
I quote, "The keys
to urbanism were,

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.600
number one, a place to work,
a place for recreation,

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.320
and the circulation system."

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:00.220
A place to live, a place to
work, a place for recreation--

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.145
and the circulation
system linking all three.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:22.130
Today, the relationship between
these is not categorical.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:34.110
Even at the time,
Lewis Mumford responded

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:38.100
to this Athens Charter.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.210
He was asked by Jose Luis Sert
to be a then-- he later became

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:45.210
dean at the GSD at Harvard.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:52.860
To write a foreword to Sert's
book, Can Our Cities Survive?

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.660
Can Our Cities Survive
is about as perfect

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.320
a document of modern
urbanism that exists.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.060
And if you're interested in the
subject, you should look at it.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.345
Mumford replied--
wrote a letter to Sert.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.920
"The four functions
of the city do not

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.450
seem to me to adequately cover
the ground of city planning.

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:23.122
Dwelling, work, recreation,
and transportation

00:20:23.122 --> 00:20:25.160
are all important.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.390
But what of the
political education

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:30.410
and cultural
function of the city?

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.470
What of the part played
by the disposition plan

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.350
of the buildings concerned
with these functions

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:40.070
in the whole evolution
of the city design?

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.940
The organs of political
and cultural [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.490
are from my standpoint
the distinguishing marks

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:47.900
of the city.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:52.040
Without them, there
is only an urban mass.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:57.950
I regard their mission
as I find their mission

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.560
as almost inexplicable.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.500
Unless some attention
is paid to this,

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.930
I have to decline
writing the foreword."

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:17.165
The third is the modern spirit.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:32.080
Modernism was associated
with a different way

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.560
of thinking about the world.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.600
It was not linked to
anything before it.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:49.940
Gropius didn't teach history
at Harvard when he was dean.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:58.870
No advocacy of the dynamic
role of what exists

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:05.920
and what is to be modern, but
most of all the zeitgeist,

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.860
the essential quality
of being modern,

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:17.110
was what became culturally
associated with architecture

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.260
and urbanism although much
more with architecture.

00:22:37.192 --> 00:22:44.620
The idea that buildings made
of mechanical material painted

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:49.720
white or white in intrinsic
systems [? three ?] [? years ?]

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:55.540
[? Lewis ?] [INAUDIBLE]
postulated free of declaration

00:22:55.540 --> 00:23:07.080
was a system of expression that
required an anti-historical

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.020
and a zeitgeist phenomenon.

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:18.700
This proposed
schismatic distinction

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:25.140
between the past
and the present was

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.890
we've now learned to
accept a diachronic view

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:32.940
of the relationship between
the past and the present.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:36.180
But at that time,
there was a notion

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:45.660
that, in many of
the protagonists,

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.170
modernism was a shared
phenomenon, which it was.

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:53.920
It was shared with
other cultural forms,

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:59.050
but other cultural forms
didn't have the obligation

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:05.200
to deal as CIAM in 1928
at its first conference

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.445
spoke about urbanism.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:12.790
It was possible in
Vienna for Brahms

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:17.020
to die in 1894
somewhere around there.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:21.110
But for revolution, modern
revolution, to take place,

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:25.420
which included Mahler's
[? Schoenberg ?]

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:30.470
and a number of people.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:40.430
But he went in modernism and
didn't have much continuity.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:48.730
The Boston Symphony orchestra
still plays, perplexedly to me,

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.850
music which was written
in the late 18th century

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:57.940
and early 19th century
in the mid 19th century.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:11.320
Modern music has not persisted
for reasons which are not

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.480
that associated with urbanism.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:23.410
But modern literature has
had a much more successful

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:26.080
penetration.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:30.250
As for the advent of new
forms of cultural expression--

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:33.370
the film, for instance,
television, and so on--

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:34.660
these are postmodern.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:43.440
I mean, in 1928, there
were fewer cars in Europe

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:48.750
than they were in Los
Angeles per capita.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:49.470
I'm sure.

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.690
I haven't checked
my figures, but I

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:57.380
think it's around about true.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:07.130
So the notion that modernism was
a permanent exercise and added

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:13.360
dogma associated
with its presence

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:25.360
gave the sense that to be
modern was a unique time and one

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.080
that was endless.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.035
Or if it wasn't endless, you
didn't care that it wasn't.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:42.100
Space-time was selected out
of the spirit of time and not

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:46.090
related backwards nor forwards.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:50.590
The idea of change was
not a significant function

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:51.460
of modernism.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:01.160
We'll go into some
of these changes.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.765
Let me get through
this more quickly.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:19.520
There was much more belief in
believing that the world could

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:24.810
be made differently, or
not be made differently

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:26.854
but behave differently.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:34.650
The notion of
constant improvement,

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:40.570
the utopia of European
social democracy,

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:46.680
the polities of
equity, the Russians,

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:52.200
the extraordinary that
in 1924, El Lissitzky,

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.750
the Russian painter and
constructivist [? Aaskov ?]

00:27:54.750 --> 00:28:01.470
[INAUDIBLE] to join him to
form an international European

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:06.390
organization of
modern architecture.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.600
Corbusier didn't agree.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:16.920
But in 1928, [INAUDIBLE] was
organized by [INAUDIBLE] Hannes

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.840
Meyer, and Hans Schmidt--

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.810
three Swiss socialists.

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.360
Hannes Mayer became
the head of the Bauhaus

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.220
for a short period of time.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.750
But there were three socialists.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:37.160
And the first declaration
at [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:47.160
was very much in a kind of
interest in urbanism of a kind.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:53.390
Let me just--
[? Lazaro's. ?] This

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:56.360
is a statement
from that meeting.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.510
"Urbanism is the organization
of all the functions

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:01.670
of collective life."

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.440
Collective life?

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.050
Why collective life?

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:09.170
"It extends over both
urban agglomerations

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:11.090
and over the countryside."

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.590
God.

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:15.650
This sounds like Los Angeles.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.556
1928.

00:29:17.556 --> 00:29:21.530
"Urbanization cannot be
conditioned by the pretensions

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:25.280
of a preexisted aestheticism."

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.140
Forget about history.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.600
"Its essence is of
a functional order."

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:36.710
the third point under urbanism
insisted the chaotic division

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.590
of land resulting in
sales, speculations,

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:44.610
inheritance must be abolished
by the collective and methodical

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:45.710
land economy.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:58.330
So throughout CIAM's
musing for 40 to 52--

00:29:58.330 --> 00:29:58.830
no.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:04.470
40 to '28 to '60 is only 32.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:11.610
32 years it wrestled
with this business

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:15.630
of what its political
identity or its attitudes

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:17.430
towards politics should be.

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:27.350
We'll touch on this
again in a bit.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:35.470
The technological
imperative-- making things

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:39.240
as if they look as if
they're made by machine.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.455
Standardization.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:54.540
Corbusier says, "I propose one
single building for all nations

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:55.500
and climates."

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:03.390
Prefabrication.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:11.950
Buckminster Fuller's
envelopes-- automobile.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:27.000
It's interesting the influence
of Henry Ford in this debate.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:34.990
Henry Ford in 1933,
or in 1930 somewhere,

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:39.010
tried to buy from Congress
the first dam that

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:42.130
later became the Tennessee
Valley Authority in Muscle

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:43.600
Shoals in Alabama.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:52.380
He advocated a linear
city of 75 kilometers--

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.870
75 miles perhaps.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:32:01.020
I don't recall-- based
upon a machine like image

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.140
of a conveyor belt
system, which he developed

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:09.490
in Detroit, coupled with
an agricultural component,

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:13.500
so people who worked in the
industry could at the same time

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:17.820
be associated with agriculture.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:25.410
He's architect of a [? kind-- ?]
took part in over 300 projects

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.840
in Russia.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:34.410
Henry Ford was revered as
a god of industrialization

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:38.010
together with FW Taylor of
the Harvard Business School.

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:42.720
Modern efficiency.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:47.130
These were fundamental claims
for the organization of a city.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:58.510
Henry Ford was fascinated
by the linear adventures

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:02.650
of [? Captain ?] [? Chambers. ?]
You will not remember that I

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:08.260
showed you the image of his plan
to link New York and Baltimore.

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.790
I think it's New
York and Baltimore

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:13.450
with a linear ongoing structure.

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:15.670
AUDIENCE: Baltimore in DC?

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:17.800
JULIAN BEINART: Was
it Baltimore in DC?

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.420
Yeah.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:20.420
Not New York.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:20.920
Yeah.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.960
So it was the Russians
and Henry Ford

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.100
were fascinated by this
new way of processing

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.615
industrial material.

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:50.000
The open-ended CIAM took
this as instructions

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.330
for thinking about
modern urbanism.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:00.685
It's an extraordinary time.

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:08.290
And the capitalism
of Henry Ford could

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:11.530
be associated with the
communism, the emerging

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:14.500
communism, or Soviet Russia.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:23.449
And all of the conflicts which
emerged in that situation

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:28.489
were never taken as
important expressions--

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:32.000
important themes in the
construction of cities.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.199
Henry Ford was an anti-Semite.

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:35.810
Albert Kahn was a Jew.

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:43.230
Henry Ford believed
that the American worker

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:48.060
should have access to nature
as the same time as being

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.730
part of an industrial system.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:55.230
Nature was never a
preoccupation of CIAM at all.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:57.390
It never appears in the debate.

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:58.870
Nature was taken for granted.

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:20.740
It's curious that nature only
appears in the urban dialogue

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:24.280
either through the work of
great landscape architects

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:33.190
like Olmsted in this country but
only through a late recognition

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:37.570
of nature as being
multilayered as having

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:41.170
ecological consequences.

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:43.930
If you look at the--
as I said before--

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:49.390
history of the Tennessee
Valley Authority, first of all,

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:55.630
Roosevelt is rejected by the
Southern urbanist, the Southern

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:58.650
Agrarian Community,
because he doesn't

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:01.640
understand their way of living.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:07.000
Roosevelt's modernism
is based on a mixture

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.280
of water, green, and
rebuilding, and resuscitation.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.760
The Tennessee Valley
Authority runs out

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.570
of [? endured ?] electorate--
by virtue of its success,

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:27.810
runs out of the capacity
of its water supply

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:33.495
to provide enough
electricity for industry,

00:36:33.495 --> 00:36:34.860
so it switches to coal.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:44.500
Coal is a ruthless
energy system.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:53.485
It is the largest ecological
disaster in the United States.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:01.210
Coal strip mining is
slowly prohibited.

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:05.840
The snail darter
controversy set in motion

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:10.570
the whole opening up of
the American interest

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:16.990
in rare species and in the
preservation of nature.

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:25.210
The atomic bomb is conceived
of and manufactured.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:30.430
At least one is manufactured in
the Tennessee Valley Authority.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:34.730
That's another
anti-natural phenomenon.

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:37.870
So the conflict
between nature as it

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:47.750
emerges from about
1930 onward to 2020,

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:55.690
the time that we are now
in, indicates the absence

00:37:55.690 --> 00:38:03.990
of the negative consequences
of denying nature

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:05.835
a certain kind of presence.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.280
Roosevelt was very
interesting in that regard.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.550
His people, like his
advisors like Martin,

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:19.560
Lewis Mumford,
and Benton MacKaye

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:23.970
stressed the
reconstruction of nature

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:28.470
in the state of great
poverty and setbacks

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:31.350
and destruction of nature.

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:35.190
But the conception
of nature as having

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:44.870
more ecological
consequences remained late.

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:50.145
Number five, universalisation
of modernity.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:57.440
When asked to remember that
the notion that the world could

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:02.330
be one system was much
more powerful at a time

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:06.380
when CIAM was in its infancy.

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:11.780
You remember that
Woodrow Wilson in 1919

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:15.740
went to the peace
conference in Paris

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:20.360
and was greeted by the largest
crowds in the history of Paris

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:24.660
still even larger
than any event today.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:28.040
So hungry was the world
for the most brutal--

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:33.120
after the most brutal war
in probably in modern times,

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:40.280
the 14-18 war, that the
notion of a league of nations,

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:43.865
agnosticism, Esperanto,
a universal language.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:54.440
The problem of universal
identity and culture--

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:57.695
the internationalization of
style, politics, religion,

00:39:57.695 --> 00:39:58.195
language.

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:20.890
Central to the idea of
modernism at that time

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:27.220
was if there was a
formula which was correct,

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:32.350
you remember Corbusier
talking about his Algiers plan

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:37.480
as denouncing the public for
not accepting what he thought

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.910
was correct.

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.880
But when a plan is correct,
an item is correct,

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.220
it must have universal
significance.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:52.090
This is before the
internet, before many

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:54.220
of the avenues of
internationalism

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:55.930
that we now have.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:41:03.250
And yet, if anything,
the opposite is true.

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:07.900
Local identity is revered
more strongly today than--

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:13.040
how could there not be?

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.960
There wasn't.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.280
CIAM never spoke about poverty.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:21.260
It spoke about the poor
condition of housing

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:25.910
but never examined the issue
of resource distribution

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:27.740
in the world.

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:33.770
It took from 1950, which was
virtually the end of CIAM,

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:38.240
for the first book to appear
on the third world city--

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:41.180
Charlie Abrams's
book, Man's Struggle

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:44.810
for Shelter in an
Urbanizing World

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:51.590
using a notion of
universalism which

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:56.510
was very parallel to the
conditions that were operating

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:57.970
in Europe and America.

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:08.730
The new client-- number six.

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:20.360
The new corporations.

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:35.100
Corbusier referred to a
parallel between governments

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.300
and corporations.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:43.890
His position, like
Henry Ford, held

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:49.520
that because the code of
mass production was natural.

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.120
What is natural about
mass production?

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:57.360
It could be and was,
of course, applied

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.990
under any political regime.

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:03.450
Hence, for Corbusier,
it was above politics.

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:09.320
You will recall that I
claimed that Corbusier

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:15.950
in his various plans associated
him with different but often

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:20.930
highly conflicted
political systems

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:24.410
even to the extent of
asking Mussolini for help

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:28.325
in order to get his Algiers
plan put into place.

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:42.490
This was a world in which
public authorities were

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:44.950
developing their own strength--

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.650
new kinds of ideas of
bylaws, codes, standards.

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:03.890
The same time that these
were being developed,

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:08.150
the modern urbanists
had a few other

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:13.280
[? contradicted ?]
ideas to whether--

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:18.830
many of them were influenced
by what was happening in Russia

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:21.980
and believed that the
universality of the state

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:30.500
was a modern phenomenon which
would detect for the first time

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:34.850
the quote natural
law of distinction

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:38.790
between poor and rich.

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:43.980
Marx talks about the lack
of a natural law, which

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:48.450
suggests that some people should
have resources and others not.

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:58.230
There was an ambiguity
about the role of the state.

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:04.110
Corbusier made no bones
about appealing to Mussolini

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:07.890
as head of a fascist state.

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:10.710
He made no bones
about in his appeals

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:18.360
to Moscow when invited to
do a revised plan in Moscow

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:25.350
to the politics of the situation
as Henry Ford built forts

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:32.430
and tractors in Russia,
built Ford automobile

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:36.390
structures in Russia,
and had no notion

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:44.090
that the politics of
Russia was inimical

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:50.030
to his own political positions.

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:57.580
The finite program, the
fundamental proposition

00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:01.870
about the master plan
which was a picture

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:04.270
with no change, no adjustment.

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:14.450
The fundamental event
of the modern age

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:18.020
is the conquest of
the world as picture.

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.900
The word picture
or build now means

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:24.320
the structured image that
is the creation of man's

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:28.340
producing which man represents--

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:31.580
which represents
and sets before.

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:34.760
In such, producing man
contains for the position

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.430
which he can be that
particularly [? yard ?] so

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:40.130
on and so on and so on.

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:41.990
This is from Heidegger--

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:47.840
the notion that somehow
the world is best conceived

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.780
as a complete picture.

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:53.570
Urbanism according
to Camillo Sitte

00:46:53.570 --> 00:47:00.200
is a set of truncated visions
and visual experiences

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.380
of the world.

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:10.850
Modernism implies as a
struggle with that image.

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:14.480
There's a question as
to whether that image is

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.920
appropriate for modernism.

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:26.330
[? After ?] Wagner claims, and
so do the modern composers,

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:33.860
that music is not noise, the
world of urban experience,

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:40.220
to be conditioned by limited
structures but by continuity.

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:43.640
Music concrete is
really not broken

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:47.300
up into beginning
into fours movement

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.820
as the classical symphony is.

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:54.350
These are Alban Berg's music
and Schoenberg's music.

00:47:54.350 --> 00:48:01.280
There's much more of an attempt
to use tonal structures which

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:09.090
are not located in time
according to precepts

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:14.640
but are flowing and free and can
be experienced with difficulty.

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:21.260
Jazz has gone through
the same program--

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:26.930
Charlie Parker's great
playing in the 1950s.

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:28.100
I think he died.

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:31.390
When did Parker die?

00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:38.480
Has the same classical
quality which then gets

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.780
lost with Cecil
Taylor and others

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:46.880
as free music becomes
more possible.

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:54.200
For the earlier modernists,
they were on the edge of this

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.270
trying to understand
this freedom

00:48:56.270 --> 00:49:05.080
but trying still to stick to
control aspects of planning

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:06.490
in the finite program.

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:12.510
Number nine, the self-image
of the architect.

00:49:16.398 --> 00:49:18.540
Oh heavens.

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:19.665
This is a long story.

00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:25.780
The sanctity of the
creative object,

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:30.130
the separation of high
and popular realms,

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:32.980
the value of silence
and obscurity in art.

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:38.800
Number 10, the spatial
[? photo ?] [? cavity, ?]

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:45.940
spatial isolation,
separation of uses,

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.140
automobiles and pedestrians.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:56.800
I mean, when Christopher
Alexander wrote the city is not

00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:00.380
a tree and argued that the
city is much more like a ladder

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:05.020
system, he was debunking a
popular modern conception.

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:12.240
Gropius goes on about,
and CIAM as well,

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:17.220
about the need for a core.

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:20.670
A core is a place where
everybody comes together

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:23.250
voluntarily.

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:28.740
The single center of a city is
conceived of as the only way

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.110
in which that can happen.

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:35.780
Gropius goes on and
on about the core.

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:41.390
CIAM, in one of its conferences,
also goes on about the core.

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:47.170
Is a multicore
city not feasible?

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:55.340
Is Toronto or Los Angeles--

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:59.080
are they not modern cities?

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:11.570
The recreation of
the core implies

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:16.220
a kind of clarity of form,
the absence of multiplicity

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:21.630
and conflict, the
lack of diversity,

00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:30.060
the benignness of open
space, the eradication

00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:32.940
of distinctions between
public and private space.

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:41.505
This is what Corbusier says
about the traditional street.

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:48.110
A street is a roadway
that is usually

00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:52.250
bordered by pavements narrow
or wide as the case may be.

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:56.150
The sky is a remote
hub far, far above it.

00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:59.060
The street is no more than
a change of deep cliff

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:00.980
to narrow passage.

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.720
Our hearts are always
oppressed by the constriction

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:05.810
of its enclosing walls.

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:07.520
The street weighs us out.

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.080
And when all is
said and done, we

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:12.810
have to admit it disgusts us.

00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:14.400
Then why does it still exist?

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:22.580
How do you explain
the preoccupation

00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:28.040
with the street as one
of the urbanistic slogans

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.240
of cultural urbanism?

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:40.520
AUDIENCE: That kind
of is the street

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:48.270
is the main perception
of urbanistic experience,

00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:50.760
because when you're not on
the street, you're either in--

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.885
you know, when you're not
in the street of a plaza,

00:52:52.885 --> 00:52:54.322
then you're in a private space.

00:52:54.322 --> 00:52:55.530
JULIAN BEINART: I understand.

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:58.500
But these people
that we're talking

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:00.720
about, all of these
people sitting

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:05.520
around these conferences,
CIAM, weren't fooled.

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:08.650
They were some of the
smartest people of their time.

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:14.220
They had adequate
sensibility about the street.

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:20.100
Why does [INAUDIBLE],, one of
the sub-group working groups

00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:29.910
of CIAM, propose the
abolition of the street

00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:35.410
in [? sardars ?] plan and
the creation of the Corbusier

00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:39.690
[INAUDIBLE] system of
an elevated highway

00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:45.120
5 meters up in the sky and
the flat plane of the city

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:49.050
being a continuous green
space with no distinction

00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:52.780
between private
and public space?

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:56.580
It's a radical change.

00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:59.130
Corbusier wrote
a lot of nonsense

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:02.770
as well as being
a great architect.

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:07.800
So one must deny a lot of
these words as rubbish.

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:14.560
But it is remarkable
that so many people

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:21.700
could accept that modernism
laid speed for automobiles,

00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:29.020
untrammelled conflict with
automobile, the street

00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:34.280
as being an outmoded
spatial item.

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:37.670
If you deny history,
you must easily

00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:40.580
deny its artifacts as well.

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:44.420
And its artifacts
are cranky, difficult

00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:50.165
to negotiate, non-rectangular
urban systems.

00:54:53.650 --> 00:54:57.040
It's difficult to
understand, but this

00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:06.700
is where your heritage
starts in modernism--

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:14.920
the complete appropriation
of an industrial phenotype,

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:19.600
the idea that the world could
be made more equal, more

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:24.610
efficient, more
advanced through science

00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:30.460
if only it took up the
same techniques that

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:31.870
produced automobiles.

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:40.050
We live in a completely
different time.

00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:45.630
That's why I go back to
start with this dialogue

00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:49.725
about the advent
of modern urbanism.

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:58.990
My real estate friends say
it's impossible to sell

00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:00.640
a modern house in Cambridge.

00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:10.250
A modern house is rated way
below a Victorian house which

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:13.820
has decorative systems which
are driven out of [? letters ?]

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:14.690
[? from ?] the bin.

00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:28.620
Most interesting to me is
the cataloging of culture.

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:31.650
So that we understand
where we are,

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:36.720
who could have predicted
that the quaintness

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:43.500
and reconservatism
of the new urbanism

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:49.110
would have such an
incredible market in relation

00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:52.220
to these advents of modernism?

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:58.040
It extends almost in
opposition to every aspect

00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:01.338
of modern urbanism
that I can imagine.

00:57:04.550 --> 00:57:10.690
It's attempted historicism
amongst others.

00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:18.190
OK.

00:57:21.929 --> 00:57:26.127
Let's leave Corbusier and
this stuff for a moment.

00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:36.125
Umberto Eco is a very
smart philosopher.

00:57:36.125 --> 00:57:39.920
He says, "I believe the city
is a kind of organism which

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:44.660
forms haggardly by itself
and, at a certain point,

00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:48.280
acquires certain
lines of tendencies.

00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.620
The architect is the
one who can interpret

00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:54.790
these lines of tendencies to
correct the city to reshape it

00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:56.170
but never globally."

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.980
This is a post-modern view.

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:10.370
"I would conclude,
therefore, that my view

00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:12.410
of the epistemology
of architects

00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:15.260
is the notion of
adjustment and conjecture."

00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:21.930
The apostle of
postmodern urbanism,

00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:24.630
not post-modern in the
architectural sense

00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:30.570
but in the reconstruction
of modernism,

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:32.940
you can read Koolhaas.

00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:39.350
And we can leave this
story with "Modernism's

00:58:39.350 --> 00:58:42.320
alchemistic promise
to transform quantity

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:45.200
into quality through
abstraction and repetition

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:50.660
has been a failure, a hoax,
magic that didn't work.

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:54.770
Its idea's aesthetic
strategies are finished.

00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:57.680
Together, all attempts to
make a new beginning have only

00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:02.720
discredited the idea
of a new beginning.

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.190
If there is to be
a new urbanism,

00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:07.880
it will not be based
on the twin fantasies

00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.710
of order and omnipotence.

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:14.750
It will be the staging
of uncertainty.

00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:19.100
It will no longer aim
for stable configurations

00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:21.770
that for the creation
of enabling fields that

00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:25.520
accommodate processes that
refuse to be crystallized

00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.870
into definitive form.

00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:33.260
It will no longer be about
meticulous definition,

00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:36.590
the imposition of limits,
but about expanding

00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:40.760
the notions denying boundaries
not about separating

00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:44.720
and identifying entities
but about discovering

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.390
unnamable hybrids.

00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:50.660
It will no longer be
obsessed with the city

00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:53.370
but with the manipulation
of infrastructure

00:59:53.370 --> 00:59:58.100
for endless intensification
and diversification, shortcuts

00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:01.070
and distribution,
the reinvention

01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:04.460
of psychological space."

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:09.060
And one last sentence
from this great gentleman.

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:12.690
"How to explain the paradox
that urbanism as a profession

01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:15.000
has disappeared
at the moment when

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.100
urbanization is everywhere?"

01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:23.990
Brings us to the
current condition.

01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:33.600
To the extent that--

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.080
let's perhaps look at.

01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:50.520
However, perhaps you
haven't got time.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.105
We need to look at a few images.

01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:09.765
Architectural history
is never taught,

01:01:09.765 --> 01:01:14.950
or history is never
taught about the present,

01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:18.910
because there isn't
enough evidence come

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:20.610
to a conclusion about it.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:33.510
Koolhaas is as vigorous a use
of language as Le Corbusier.

01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:36.220
Le Corbusier wrote
hundreds of thousands

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:39.010
of words, published
everything he could,

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:43.210
documented his work in books
that are now very valuable.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:49.600
Koolhaas is trying
to do the same trying

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:55.390
to articulate a universal
attitude when universalism

01:01:55.390 --> 01:02:01.980
is relatively absent.

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:07.975
We cannot find an international
agreement about climate change.

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:16.255
So international
agreements are--

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:27.990
but what is correct about
Koolhaas' proposition

01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:33.480
that modern urbanism is dead?

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.960
All of these propositions
that I put forward

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:45.080
are not to be taken
seriously in the long run.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.020
What are we left with?

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:51.406
What have we
developed on our own?

01:02:51.406 --> 01:02:55.040
I'll try to articulate as
best I can some of these

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.620
in the next few classes.

01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:02.450
The anti-- the development.

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:09.860
The urbanistic idea
develop after 1960

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:15.170
when CIAM fell apart at
Dubrovnik and Otterlo--

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:22.010
at the conferences at
Dubrovnik and Otterlo in 1960.

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:26.780
It was replaced by a group
of young European architects

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:33.380
at the 10th congress of CIAM,
who called themselves Team 10.

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.420
We look at their preoccupations.

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:38.600
We look at the
rationalist preoccupations

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:43.640
of Leon Krier and Aldo Rossi
and people of this kind

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:49.610
to see whether there's any
generation of accumulated

01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:51.885
wisdom about urbanism.

01:03:56.882 --> 01:04:00.090
Is there any permanence
in our preoccupation

01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:03.330
with traditional streets?

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:15.190
You're interested, Michael,
in preservation theory.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.690
Are we at the height of a
preservation phenomenon?

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:29.350
How is it that Jane
Jacobs in fighting

01:04:29.350 --> 01:04:37.010
Robert Moses around the
future about housing

01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:43.030
in New York, which Moses
wished to dispatch and replace

01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:45.910
with modern apartment blocks?

01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:48.940
We wouldn't allow
that to happen now.

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:51.160
We wouldn't have
allowed the west end

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:55.150
to be removed through
urban renewal.

01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:57.760
Why?

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.150
AUDIENCE: There's a fairly new--

01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:07.096
the value of preservation is
a fairly recent phenomenon.

01:05:07.096 --> 01:05:10.350
For many centuries,
cities were just--

01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:11.550
they were very.

01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:13.380
They destroyed parts
of the city in order

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.948
to build something
new on top of it.

01:05:15.948 --> 01:05:18.240
AUDIENCE: I think the big
difference between modern era

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:20.010
is scale.

01:05:20.010 --> 01:05:22.890
You know, I mean, you can't--

01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:24.810
it's not just
destroying a building.

01:05:24.810 --> 01:05:27.030
It's wiping out
whole neighborhoods

01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:30.050
and building things that
function on a different scale.

01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:30.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:05:30.810 --> 01:05:32.643
AUDIENCE: That's the
big change between what

01:05:32.643 --> 01:05:33.840
had happened before.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:37.330
AUDIENCE: I understand
the function of scale.

01:05:37.330 --> 01:05:41.740
But the notion between an
entity having the capability

01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:46.090
of destroying that value
whether it's small or large

01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:49.000
comes from the appreciation
of the value within society,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.770
because society
ultimately allows

01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:55.500
for that to happen
regardless of the scale.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:06:01.700
When you go big, it's just
can be more scandalous if you

01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:02.320
want it to.

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:05.020
AUDIENCE: But it's not just
the scale of the project.

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:10.400
It's the scale of how the
resulting urbanism is used.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:13.900
I mean, and that's what--

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:18.144
the modernists aren't
thinking on a human scale.

01:06:18.144 --> 01:06:19.640
[INAUDIBLE] [? auto ?] scale.

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:20.265
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:06:20.265 --> 01:06:22.267
AUDIENCE: And so that
changes the function.

01:06:22.267 --> 01:06:22.850
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:06:22.850 --> 01:06:23.710
I agree with that.

01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:28.980
JULIAN BEINART: It's
still perplexing,

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:32.850
as a young modernist
myself, to be

01:06:32.850 --> 01:06:39.390
living in a culture which has
so many dissonances with what

01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:43.560
I was taught to believe in.

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:50.910
Either one lives too
long, which is a problem,

01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:55.470
or one has to try
to make some sense.

01:06:55.470 --> 01:07:02.610
The new urbanism
couldn't have existed

01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:05.070
in the orthodoxy of CIAM.

01:07:05.070 --> 01:07:09.450
First of all, they were
all mainly Europeans

01:07:09.450 --> 01:07:12.030
and didn't understand
the nostalgia

01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:18.810
for the small community
of the American suburban.

01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:23.850
All the new urbanism has done
is done cosmetically touching

01:07:23.850 --> 01:07:26.970
of the phase of suburbia.

01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:31.080
It hasn't been able to deal with
any of the fundamental problems

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.120
of American urbanism--

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:43.620
race, numbers, social equity,
and above all the automobile.

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:50.595
The densities, which the new
urbanists continue to proclaim,

01:07:50.595 --> 01:07:53.730
are automobile densities.

01:07:53.730 --> 01:07:58.270
They cannot justify
public transportation.

01:07:58.270 --> 01:08:01.920
So the dilemma as to what
the notion of density

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:04.470
is in the contemporary
American city

01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:08.040
is fundamentally around
a number of properties,

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:13.350
which the new urbanist
just decline to deal with.

01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:15.270
Let's look at some
of these images.

01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:17.660
They're only a few.

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:21.330
A typical modernist proposition.

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:25.109
First of all, the building
is an autonomous object.

01:08:25.109 --> 01:08:26.910
It stands by itself.

01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:32.819
It is not seen as related to
anything else but circulation.

01:08:32.819 --> 01:08:41.609
Circulation consists of a
high-speed system which feeds

01:08:41.609 --> 01:08:49.890
with a major intersection
down to a local road--

01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:52.590
needs an open space in front
of this building, which

01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:55.470
is unaccounted for.

01:08:55.470 --> 01:09:00.359
Why do you need an open space
in front of that building?

01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:03.689
There's an attempt
to access pedestrians

01:09:03.689 --> 01:09:07.020
along these white
stripes, which presumably

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:08.399
are pedestrian routes.

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:22.069
There's another highway
intersection a few kilometers,

01:09:22.069 --> 01:09:30.770
or maybe not even that,
much too close together.

01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:36.649
It is naivete about the
design of these systems

01:09:36.649 --> 01:09:41.300
where one can forgive
people for that.

01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:44.120
I've already discussed
Gropius' notion

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:54.320
that buildings separated
at a certain distance given

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.030
their height.

01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:59.075
It needs to be studied next.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.690
The preoccupation with the type.

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:14.390
This is an interesting question.

01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:20.600
[? Jonah ?] [? Braken ?] feels
that the type is a necessary

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:25.010
cultural phenomenon-- that we
need to study it in order that

01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:31.850
we can maintain
continuity in our culture.

01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:36.200
Here, type is studied
as a scientific system

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:40.490
to show that you
can create housing

01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:43.190
for large numbers
of people once you

01:10:43.190 --> 01:10:52.980
identify the essential spatial
formal DNA of the plan.

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:55.030
We know this one--

01:10:55.030 --> 01:11:01.040
the ridiculous assumptions
denying the existence

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.680
of [? Third ?]
[? Street, ?] which is one

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.220
of the remarkable--

01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:12.710
these successful pieces of
urbanism, late 19th century

01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:16.280
urbanism, and replacing
it with a staggeringly

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:20.500
stupid proposition
of Corbusier's

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:23.115
[INAUDIBLE] or teeth system.

01:11:23.115 --> 01:11:23.615
Next.

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:33.930
Just a few slides of numbers.

01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:40.550
They are in Italy, and I
put them in a sequence.

01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:45.560
Traditional poor urban
housing would be for the rich

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:48.080
as well in Milan on the left.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:55.300
The first attempt in
[INAUDIBLE] to build

01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:59.830
state-supported public housing.

01:11:59.830 --> 01:12:01.138
Walk-ups. Next.

01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:17.920
[INAUDIBLE] walk-ups stretching
four floors as much as you can

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:23.660
and giving a modern
facade to the apparatus.

01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:30.190
The [INAUDIBLE] project by
Giovanni Astengo showing

01:12:30.190 --> 01:12:33.070
the layout of these
blocks in relation

01:12:33.070 --> 01:12:43.990
to an uncultivated, open space.

01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:47.500
The open space is a trivial
remainder of the design.

01:12:50.255 --> 01:12:50.755
next.

01:12:54.310 --> 01:13:00.080
Antonio [? Milano ?]
now building

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:04.100
buildings with elevators
close together in an attempt

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:07.010
to create density,
but the density

01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:14.400
is still remarkably absent
of producing a city.

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:14.900
Next.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:24.020
And finally the attempt to
deal with numbers by extending

01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:26.030
the prototype endlessly.

01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:31.580
This is one project.

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:35.000
And I think it's
around on the left.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.940
And I think it's
Genoa on the right.

01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:37.750
I'm not sure.

01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:44.860
Koolhaas is correct in
looking at this and saying,

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:50.320
what have we learned about
the problem of number?

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.260
Very little.
