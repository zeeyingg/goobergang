00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.670
JULIAN BEINART:
First of all, we did

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:42.130
case studies of five cities with
reference to the 19th century

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.250
primarily, and how
they dealt with similar

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.070
of the fundamentals change.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.880
Any thoughts before we move on?

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.080
Any comparisons
that strike you--

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.755
London, Paris, Barcelona,
Vienna, and Chicago?

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.570
AUDIENCE: I think it's
interesting with Paris

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.190
and Vienna how their
interventions were, in the end,

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.175
more integrated and sort of on
top of what was there before,

00:01:23.175 --> 00:01:26.040
whereas Chicago is was
all new, and Barcelona--

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.130
you have a medieval city and
then the Cerd치 plan as two

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.230
completely separate.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.620
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.170
Yeah.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.240
The Cerd치 model, as I argued, is
probably the most conventional

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.200
model.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.240
That is you leave the center
of the city and its walls,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.570
where you take down the walls
because everybody took down

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.140
the walls.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.710
The taking down of the walls
in Barcelona was before

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.390
Cerd치's competition.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.920
So it was really moving in
the direction of expansion.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.190
But the scale of Cerd치's
expansion plan is phenomenal.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.320
How it is that the
city, model city,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.940
would undertake such an
enormous expansion under such

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.800
a rigid control is remarkable.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.400
It puts Barcelona in a
category almost all of its own.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.550
Chicago's expansion
was from 1830 onwards.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.570
You built a house.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.010
You built another house.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.540
You built another house.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.520
There was no city involvement
in the expansion of Chicago.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.100
It was purely a market
driven phenomenon.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.040
AUDIENCE: But wasn't
the grid where

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.020
you could build that
house already established

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.440
through the government
division of land?

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.520
JULIAN BEINART: Well, I didn't
know the history well enough

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.820
to know what is
government subdivision.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.120
It's a tract of land which is
developed by a developer often

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.170
according to--

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.280
the weakness of
Chicago's governance

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.840
is significant in the history.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.810
It separated out completely
from the other cities.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.530
European urban control is
a much more significant

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.980
than American urban control.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.560
[INAUDIBLE] has argued that
the American layout often

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.990
included larger pieces of
land than was required.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:56.190
And this he argued,
was a good investment

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.825
in that you could then double
up or expand over time.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.970
Seeing how only half
the lot was built,

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.200
you could double up the
density for instance.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.600
I did a studio
project many years

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.630
ago here in
Cambridgeport, where I

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.430
argued that one could densify
without changing the existing

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.480
buildings.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.475
That there was
enough space to do--

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.920
and the reality of the
situation is that Cambridgeport

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.360
is absolutely resistant to any
plan which is densifies it's

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.670
area for one reason mainly--

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.570
automobile traffic.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.700
You cannot in Newton, if you
have built yourself a palace

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:57.980
and have half another lot
free, you cannot even rent out

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:04.460
another property because of the
fear of an increase in density

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.020
automobiles.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.790
AUDIENCE: But that is changing.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.543
I mean slowly, but the fight
over laneway housing is going--

00:05:13.543 --> 00:05:14.960
JULIAN BEINART:
It may over time--

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.660
I don't know whether
ownership of property

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.385
sets up a greater lack
of indulgence in change.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.320
Pullman, Illinois
was an example of him

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.120
not wanting to let home
ownership exist because he felt

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.010
that home ownership would
stand in the way of the people

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.250
changing their
psychological apparatus

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.730
and living much cleaner lives--

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.980
as he is a paternalist--
were unwanted.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.730
I don't know.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.290
I was just reading
again about EUR.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.370
Do you know EUR--

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.380
1942?

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.810
Michaela, you know
what EUR stands for.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.825
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:24.825 --> 00:06:25.700
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:36.830
Exposizione Universale Roma.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:47.240
EUR was intended as a fascist
commemoration exposition

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.630
20 years after the
origins of fascism

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.000
in Italy and the Mussolini.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.970
Anyway, we'll deal
later with this.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.990
I want to now shift
gears a bit and do

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.430
three classes which reflect
backwards on these case

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.600
studies.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.950
The first one today deals with
a very difficult proposition.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:22.235
And that is the
expression of power.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:32.150
The second one, on Thursday,
will deal with utopianism

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:37.970
because the 19th century was a
very hotbed of utopian attempts

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.675
to change the form and
social structure of cities.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.980
And thirdly, I will
conclude this section

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.370
by looking at England--

00:07:53.370 --> 00:08:00.750
the New Towne's proposition
in England after the '46 war--

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:06.030
and Russia between
1917 and 1932--

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:12.990
pre-Stalinist Russia--
as examples of attempts

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:19.290
to counter the problems
that the 19th century

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.540
city provided in a sense.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:35.270
I think the material
I'm doing today

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:40.909
and the next two classes
suggests much more interaction

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:42.380
with you.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.660
I would want your
opinion on things

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.970
which I'm going to propose--

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.650
difficult things.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:52.565
Things which are very
difficult to establish in fact.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:01.970
I start off with a quotation.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.920
"In 16th century Paris a
popular form of entertainment

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:16.020
was cat burning,
In which a cat was

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:23.550
hoisted on a sling on a stage
and slowly lowered into a fire.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.190
According to historian
Norman Davies,

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.280
the spectators, including
Kings and Queens,

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.570
shrieked with laughter as the
animal was howling in pain

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:43.120
was singed till roasted
and finally demolished.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.000
Such sadism would be
unspeakable in today."

00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:04.290
Another French example,
"Damiens, the incompetent

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.620
would be assassin of
Louis XV--" Louis XV

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.440
was an incompetent man himself.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.430
He had an incompetent
assassin, Damiens.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.840
"He was sentenced to be
torn to pieces by 6 horses,

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.270
to be stabbed and
have his wounds

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.500
soiled with burning
sulfur and molten lead,

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.750
and a good deal more
in the same vein."

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.677
Why don't we do that anymore?

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:45.830
According to the best writer
on the subject, Michel Foucault

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.070
in his book
Discipline and Punish,

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:55.880
we have substituted hard
measures for soft measures.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:01.400
And in his view, soft measures
introduced by liberal society

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:07.990
where punishment is less
obvious and less brutal

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.100
is nevertheless curtailing
our freedom in society.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.910
So let's look at that
proposition a little more.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:28.240
Let's look at the proposition
of the facade in architecture.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.160
And then let's look
at two case studies.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.810
The one of the proposed
five mile rebuilding

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:40.420
of the center of Berlin
by Albert Speer and Hitler

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:46.360
in which we find some very
interesting components

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:53.090
of ideology which one might
relate to fascism or not.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:58.420
And the other example is
the 2 1/2 mile Avenue in St.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.940
Petersburg in Russia.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:07.870
The Nevsky Prospekt named
after Alexander Nevsky who

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:13.510
was a 19-year-old
leader of Russia,

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:20.875
defeated the invading forces
from the North many years ago.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:30.222
So let's start with this
soft replacement of the hard

00:12:30.222 --> 00:12:30.805
with the soft.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.330
Let's look at first
order a couple

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.880
of characteristic of
the 19th century which

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.065
appear in these cases.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:50.060
First of all, the
Enlightenment is--

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.420
and of people as individuals--

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.415
the specialization of places.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:06.690
The work which shows how
the integrated house--

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.110
which include craftsmen,
families, and all together

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.570
in the medieval Guild--

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:18.410
was replaced by separate rooms
and typologies of houses--

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.240
a special places for servants--

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:27.260
upstairs, downstairs,
in the British movies--

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.930
warehouses for workers,
and most importantly,

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.810
separation of work and home.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.720
The journey to work
becomes a phenomenon

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.966
of contemporary society.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:42.760
It's still is.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:56.580
In the land of the salt mining,
salt processing town of Chaux--

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:04.910
C-H-A-U-X-- built in the
late 18th century in France,

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:09.020
you will see there are houses
for blue collar workers

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.880
and houses for white
collar workers.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.140
There is a typology
associated with each.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:19.480
And Ledoux designed Chaux--

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.320
the architect of
the Ancien R칠gime.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.310
I would show you a house for an
intellectual that he designed.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:33.530
Imagine conceiving of a project
of a house for an intellectual.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.890
There is a typology
associated with each category

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.190
of human beings.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.930
The concept of
typology has stuck

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.180
with architectural thought.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.820
It's been revived
in our own times,

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.250
but in a different
kind of sense.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:52.250
When we talk about
Aldo Rossi, we

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.370
will go back into the
contemporary meaning

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.650
of the typological experiment.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:05.950
A second characteristic
of 19th century space

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.550
was the organization
of complex space.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:19.810
The census in 1801 in England
used the cadastral system

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.430
for measuring land--

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:26.750
maps of boundaries and
ownership, specialized sewage

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:31.830
plants, and the capacity
of a new management

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:35.960
to organize complex space.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.120
Thirdly, new forms
for institutions--

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:45.290
here we go back to our
story about punishment.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.920
Fire no longer
needs to be violent.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.900
Killing no longer needs to
be seen symbolic in public.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:59.840
The guillotine is used for the
last time in 1789, I think,

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.610
more or less.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:04.745
Torture is no longer visible.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.960
Well yeah, I'm generalizing.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.830
Modern society
attempts to teach you

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:25.920
to reform and change your habits
rather than persecuting you.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:32.820
In order to do that, you have
the new idea of panopticism.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:38.610
Panopticism being a
system where an individual

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:42.510
is watched from a
central position,

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:47.890
but doesn't know when he
or she is being watched.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:51.550
A series of louvers
separates the prisoners.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.510
The prisoners are isolated
from each other so they cannot

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.680
communicate.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:02.660
The prisoners are either
workers, schoolboys, or madmen.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.950
Light enters from the outside,
and creates a silhouette

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:15.230
which allows the person
doing the envisioning to see

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.760
the person being watched.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.690
I quote from Foucault,
"The prisoner is seen,

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.670
but he does not see.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.235
He's the object of
information, never

00:17:28.235 --> 00:17:31.130
a subject in communication.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:35.980
Power should be visible,
but unverifiable.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:44.270
Institutions can now move
forward from being dungeons,

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.940
to being light structures.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.480
A new prison preserves
only the enclosure,

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:59.790
but eliminates the need to
deprive the patients of light

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:00.860
or to hide them.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.240
No bars, no chains,
no heavy locks--

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.980
fortress-like architecture is
replaced by economic geometry.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:21.840
This is parallel with
taking down the city walls."

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.190
You know what a
panoptagon looks like?

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:29.940
I've just described it in words.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.490
Shall I draw it on a--

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:35.980
can you imagine what this is--

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.630
yeah, of course.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:43.430
I'm sorry, I forget
what I'm doing.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.220
There are many variations.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.130
Those are two from
Mexico, I think.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.790
Elaborate structures
all maintaining

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:55.300
a certain central idea.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:19:03.100
That you can watch a patient
or schoolboy or prisoner

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:10.350
without locking him up in the
sense of using every instrument

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.670
for preserving his security.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:25.490
According to Foucault, this
creates an environment in which

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:32.050
institutions of health,
institutions of production--

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:36.950
I will talk about the
salt extraction city

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:44.410
Chaux near Switzerland,
1775, 1779--

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:45.790
and so on and so on.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:56.870
Foucault uses the analogy of
what happens during the plague.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.430
This is a fairly long.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.140
I'm going to go through
it very quickly.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.880
When the plague
appears in a town

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.745
at the end of the
17th century, first

00:20:10.745 --> 00:20:14.690
the strict spatial partition,
the closing of the town

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:18.200
and its outlying
districts, prohibition

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.690
to leave the town
on pain of death,

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.090
the killing of
all stray animals,

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:27.230
the division of the town
to district quarters each

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.150
governed by an attendant.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:32.300
Each street is-- and
he goes on and on

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.510
about the details of
how food is distributed,

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:40.310
the powers of each street
superintendent, death

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.860
is often the
punishment inflicted

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.630
on somebody who doesn't obey.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:50.060
It is a segmented,
immobile, frozen space--

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.060
each individually
fixed in his place.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.990
And if he moves, he does
so at the risk of his life,

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.000
contagion, or punishment.

00:21:01.892 --> 00:21:06.680
He analogizes this was
the panopticon space.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.980
This enclosed segmented
space observed

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.950
at every point in which the
individuals are inserted

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:16.510
in a fixed place, in which
the slightest movements are

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:20.180
supervised, in which
all events are recorded,

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:23.240
in which an uninterrupted
work of writing

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.180
links the center and periphery.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.630
Power is exercised
without division

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:33.590
according to a continuous
hierarchical figure.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:35.860
All this constitutes
a compact model

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.520
of the disciplinary mechanism.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:53.140
It's [INAUDIBLE] that
the possible outcomes

00:21:53.140 --> 00:22:03.630
of contravening the orthodox
environment of the plague

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:07.800
superimposed upon a place--

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:12.450
if he moves he does so at the
risk of his life, contagion,

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:13.860
or punishment--

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.230
three awful results.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:31.460
In the sense that
when it requires

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:37.880
a specialization of types, as
well as a sense of geometry

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.810
of control, one can
find no better example

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:48.635
than the salt extraction
factory at Chaux.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.190
I draw it on here--

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.842
actually only two
or three blocks--

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.110
the gate and the director's
house are on axis.

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:11.130
The geometry is that the
director, with his gaze--

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:23.390
here is he-- over the workers
who live on the edges.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.810
Nobody knows whether the
director is watching or not.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:32.210
The trick is that
you're constantly

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.340
under the threat of
being supervised.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:42.995
The gate is decorated on the
outside, not on the inside.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.090
What that means I don't know.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.810
AUDIENCE: The decoration
isn't for the workers?

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:57.390
JULIAN BEINART:
No, the decoration

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:02.675
is for whoever gazes
from the outside.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:21.825
Blue collar workers--
sorry, reverse--

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.895
white collar workers,
blue collar workers--

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:39.300
this is a crude diagram
of a factory town.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.760
One of the first factory
towns ever built. In fact,

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.900
it may be the
first one on record

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.385
prior to the 18th century.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:52.750
Have you seen this plan before?

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.650
Where do you run into it?

00:26:01.282 --> 00:26:05.105
AUDIENCE: I think I
stayed in this same town.

00:26:05.105 --> 00:26:05.980
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:21.560
So you have a typology
of specialized space

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.090
for categories of people.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:29.960
You know this typology in
a location in the dormitory

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.770
for the director.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:43.010
You have the automatic, constant
and subtle examination process

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:43.865
by the director.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:05.010
These could be a bunch
of children being watched

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:13.410
in a laboratory through a screen
which makes them not realize

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.380
that they're being watched.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:21.210
Oh sorry, the louver
system would be here.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:24.360
The light would
reflect the people back

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.510
to the central observer.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:29.505
OK, enough bad drawing.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:55.540
We will see in the pictures some
more detailed examples of Chaux

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.890
A French contemporary writer
by the name of Paul Virilio I

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:04.520
don't know if you've ever
run into any of his writing,

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:11.930
he extend this notion of
inconspicuous examination

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.045
to the contemporary city.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:19.030
If you want an
example of somebody

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.120
who's applied it to
the American city,

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:30.790
there's a thesis done in 1989
by Daniel Glenn called The Moral

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:38.600
Society, Inclusion, Exclusion,
and Control in the Urban

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.530
Center.

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:45.110
I think he does a case study
of the John Hancock building,

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:51.620
and a couple of examples of
where insidious control is

00:28:51.620 --> 00:29:00.140
maintained whilst done in a
very elegant signifying way.

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:06.700
Virilio writes a piece
called The Overexposed

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.930
City which I'm not sure
I agree with completely.

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:20.890
But he says that we should
be conscious of the fact

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:27.130
that our behavior is now
examined and processed

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:33.710
through environmental
controls, which

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:35.345
are subtle and not so obvious.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:51.300
Take the question of
congestion control.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:57.600
Congestion control implies that
your movement in an automobile

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.330
has to be rationed.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:10.080
Therefore you pay a fee when
you pass a cordon of a kind.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:14.250
That fee is processed
by virtue of you having

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:19.830
some identification tag on your
car-- electronic identification

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:21.390
tag on your car.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:23.130
It happens on the
Mass Turnpike--

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:31.590
if you live beyond the Mass
Turnpike entrance into city.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:35.040
The objection to
congestion pricing

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:40.560
has often been that it locates
you in space without you being

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:45.120
aware that it's happening.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:51.720
If a telephone bill arrives
at home, and your wife says,

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:57.510
I see that you were on
the main road in the city

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:02.010
and at 2 o'clock in the
morning of Thursday the 22nd.

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:03.750
What were you doing there?

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:06.510
And you stumble
and say, well, I--

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.530
it's a mistake.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.030
I wasn't there.

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:12.190
The truth is I was
visiting my girlfriend.

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:18.030
It's a set of controls which
can be elaborated enormously,

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:22.290
and deprive you of your
individual liberty.

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:31.890
That issue will continue to
exert its force on the control

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:34.470
system.

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:37.980
The amount of freedom
that we will give up

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:44.280
in order for us to
maintain a sane environment

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.740
is at the issue.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:50.820
I remember being on a
small group here at MIT

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:59.280
where one of the famous
computer control people

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.440
was on the panel.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:06.360
And he made the statement
of the following kind--

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:12.960
he could reduce murder in
the society by at least 50%

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.920
by having everybody forcibly
wear a bracelet which

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.020
located them in space.

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:24.240
The fact that you can locate
yourself freely in space

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:30.810
is, of course, subverted by
a control system of a kind.

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:36.690
But a liberal control system
will not maintain your position

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:38.535
in space as a record.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:45.570
Some of you may not care
whether your movements are

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:48.150
controlled, in space or not.

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:57.180
The payoff of the declining
rate of murder to the extent

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:01.770
that everybody who commits a
murder can be located in space.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:06.980
It's an intriguing trade off.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.680
And the modern city is
going to increasingly--

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.510
the modern society--

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:12.980
Virilio are and others--

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:18.170
Foucault amongst
others-- argues that it's

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:20.060
going to become a more
and more pervasive

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:24.740
phenomenon in the
contemporary city.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:33.710
These are maybe symbolic as
well as actual phenomena.

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:37.590
I go on to another
aspect of the story.

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:42.200
And that's a piece of
writing by David Friedman who

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:46.520
is a Professor here in
the the history area.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:52.940
Friedman argues that
the medieval street

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.120
was a functioning street.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:00.600
In other words,
that it maintained

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:05.790
the processes of
commerce, expansion

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:10.110
of individuals into the
street, random affairs,

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:11.610
loose furniture.

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:15.360
A whole range of
things characterized

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:19.560
the medieval street.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.250
Not only with the
medieval street,

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:27.060
the street of multi-use,
its facades which

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:38.810
enclosed the street were
democratized and varied

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:43.760
It is not until the Renaissance
that street and palace--

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.710
and this statement
is also true for

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:48.260
modest domestic
architecture-- were

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:52.250
set into the more or less
symbiotic relationship which

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:56.810
they continue until
the 20th century.

00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:58.790
What he's saying is
the word fachada--

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:07.450
the facade of a
building or a street

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:12.670
plays the same expressive
role as the head does

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:16.000
in the human body,
it is the face

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:24.310
of what you see and
implies meanings

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:29.710
which the street is meant to
produce towards its users.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.900
There were rules in
the medieval street

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:43.620
system for how many
movable objects to allow

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:47.000
to attach to a house or shop.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.560
Movable tables or carts are
potentially so disruptive

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:55.460
to the social committee
order, were explicitly

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:56.690
banned later on.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:07.990
We still make arrangements
around the use of a street--

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:17.940
in Italian streets, in
Italian piazza in summer.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:22.050
In this country we
have now introduced

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:25.950
the possibility of doing it
even in the city of Boston.

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:29.190
Prior to recently it was
not possible to do it

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:33.630
in Boston because of
health related legislation.

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:40.620
Only a place could only
be considered healthy

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:47.100
if it maintained certain
proprietary sanitary laws.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:52.230
Now there is a relationship
possible between the use

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:56.760
of the street as
a temporary device

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:01.500
while maintaining the
facade of the street.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.790
There are transactions.

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:12.030
For instance, on the relatively
new hotel on the waterfront

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:15.210
is an arrangement
whereby the hotel

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:19.830
looks after that park
that's been created.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:23.220
In return of which,
it may serve drinks

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.280
on the terrace outside
its own property.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.990
The emergence of a facade
as a factor is interesting.

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:42.070
It promotes the expression
of meaning differently

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:50.470
from improperly
organized environment.

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:56.380
Rather than loose furniture, it
was also possible above 10 feet

00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:00.340
to project your
house into the street

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:03.560
itself to gain more space.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.010
So there was a
variety of disruptions

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:10.960
in the medieval street
to the constant orthodoxy

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.460
of the street.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:17.980
Orthodox of the street
being non-facade driven.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:22.210
According to Friedman,
this changed.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:26.830
You have for the first time,
the organization of the street

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:33.100
facade largely for palaces and
large domestic environments,

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.250
as being constant.

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:48.950
He cites the 1444 Medici
Palace in Florence--

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:52.620
recognized as the first great
palace of the Renaissance.

00:38:52.620 --> 00:39:02.650
He goes on to argue
about it's effect.

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:05.380
Facade then represents
a new relationship

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.840
with buildings in the city.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.470
It is a concept born
in the 14th century

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:13.360
and matured in the Renaissance.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:28.200
He argues, if he's correct,
in a changed identification

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:35.670
of the effect of the built
world on individual behavior.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:51.030
Aztecs of the Street of
the Dead in Teotihuacan

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.160
didn't have constant
facades, but they

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.490
had pyramids of the
moon and the sun

00:39:56.490 --> 00:40:00.615
and the strict notions of
behavior along an axis.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:06.460
The projects-- the
two projects which

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:14.530
I want to look at with
you use the Friedman idea

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:19.015
of the facade as a powerful
tool in different ways.

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:33.170
Hitler's ideology
was in part based

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:37.100
on the permanence of power.

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:46.640
The EUR in 1942 under Mussolini,
was merely an exhibition.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.150
It later became a
town or part of Rome--

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:53.060
the Southeast part of Rome.

00:40:53.060 --> 00:41:02.150
Under Hitler there was no end
to the permanence of power.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:08.030
Power was constant
and everlasting.

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:10.190
There's a wonderful
story that Speer

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:16.250
tells of working in Nuremberg
and seeing a building being

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:20.990
taken down, and looking
at the ruins, and saying,

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:25.040
we must not have
ruins as ugly as this.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:30.050
So he invent something called
the theory of ruined value.

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:37.250
Imagine a theory which
forces you to make sure

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:40.790
that the permanence
of your situation

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:44.810
is going to be beyond
the life of the building.

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:50.840
That the ruins will ruin
like great ruins of Caracalla

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.295
or the great Roman ruins.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:59.970
This is only one
example of a ideology

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:06.350
which is not temporary, but
which is seen to be permanent.

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:13.100
The style of buildings is
considered to be neo empire.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:19.760
Again, it's got to do with
everlasting circumstance.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:23.600
According to Speer, they
start with the Doric order

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.470
and keep on inventing new
orders as they go along.

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:34.030
Again, Hitler is the
beginning of a continuity.

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:43.450
Hitler himself says
to Albert Speer, whom

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:50.440
he chooses as his architect when
Speer is 26 or 24 or something,

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:56.110
he says I need somebody who
will understand when I'm dead.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:43:03.250
Meaning again, that the
normal projection of nature--

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:06.700
of life, death,
ruin, and change--

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.940
is disestablished.

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:17.397
There are a number
of examples of it.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.090
Hitler hated glass.

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:26.800
Glass was too ephemeral.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:35.590
The 1936 games were Hitler's
great international triumph.

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:40.780
And he had a stadium which he
was being modernized with glass

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.100
and so on.

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:46.855
He hated it and told them to
stop and put back the stone.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:54.980
Speer, in his spare
time, designed a stadium

00:43:54.980 --> 00:44:02.030
for 400,000 people, which is
an impossible artifact anyway.

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:08.810
You cannot have 400,000 people
in a place, and have them see.

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:10.940
The distances become too long.

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:23.710
But when Speer shows
Hitler this model,

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:29.530
Speer apologizes and says,
I'm sorry, Herr Fuhrer.

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:34.030
The Olympic games will not be
able to be held in this stadium

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:39.680
because I have changed
the base of the platform.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.880
So that the games, according to
the rules, will have to change.

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:47.860
Hitler says, don't worry.

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.580
The 1944 games are
supposed to be in Tokyo.

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:54.370
After that they will
return to Berlin

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:55.585
and be held here forever.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:04.090
Forever, meaning forever--
meaning and at the same time,

00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:06.790
of course, we will
change the Olympic rules.

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:09.100
We will change the
process in order

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:12.670
to secure the fundamental
fact of the construction.

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.610
So you get his
ideology expressed

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:24.050
in terms of an interminable
notion of continuity.

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:27.590
No end is in sight.

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:28.730
This is manic.

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:31.370
It's anti-natural.

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:34.700
We strive like hell
to keep things going.

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:42.410
But none of us have [INAUDIBLE]
and ideas about infinite time

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:46.910
unless we are so obsessed
with the inability to control

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:48.380
nature, such as death.

00:45:51.620 --> 00:46:00.780
The second set of relationships
between spatial performance

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:06.970
and the physical form--

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:12.090
special performance
and the physical form--

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:15.000
resonating with this ideology--

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.765
is the comparison system.

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:22.635
Speer constantly talks
about comparing things.

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:42.790
He talks about a project
he's doing Hitler which

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:48.400
is 2,300 feet by 3,400 feet.

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.370
He says, oh well,
Darius the first--

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:53.020
one of the great
rulers of Persia--

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:59.050
I forget the first
century BC probably--

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:07.630
only had 1,500 feet by 800 feet.

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:10.250
He says, we will erect a tower.

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:14.190
Nero had a tower of 119 feet.

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:17.740
The Statue of
Liberty is 151 feet.

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:20.920
Our Hitler statue
will be 197 feet.

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:31.070
When Leni Riefenstahl, who
made the great film Olympia

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:34.970
asked for more
money from Goebbels,

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:37.640
and then Hitler was
a great protagonist

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.740
that they make this film.

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:45.210
She said, look 1932 Olympic
games were in Los Angeles.

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:49.310
That's where Hollywood
controls the world of film.

00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:51.290
They couldn't make a movie.

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:53.690
All they did was
still photographs.

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:56.505
We need to show the world
that we are superior.

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:03.560
And she made this
extraordinary film.

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:07.160
The film starts off--
has anybody seen Olympia?

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.590
Yeah.

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:11.340
AUDIENCE: A lot of
the techniques she

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.957
used the triumph of the film.

00:48:13.957 --> 00:48:14.790
JULIAN BEINART: Yes.

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:16.220
Yes.

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:18.140
Yes.

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:23.559
One of the interesting
things too is the--

00:48:23.559 --> 00:48:27.150
what is the other?

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:29.240
Oh, my mind just slips.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.940
I'll think of it in a while.

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:39.050
This comparison notion-- there
was also ideology in the film.

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:45.470
The film starts in with pictures
of static sculptures, which

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:48.110
slowly start moving,
and they turn

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:58.040
into a running trip between
Olympia in Greece and Berlin.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:02.940
The first carrying of the flame
ever in the Olympic games--

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.990
modern Olympic games.

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:13.910
That represents not only a move
from an alien world of Greece

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:18.290
to the modern Aryan
world of Hitler,

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:22.280
but it also indicates
a connection

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:30.170
in the film between why
Hitler has the Shepherd, who

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:35.870
won the marathon in 1896
in the Athens games,

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:39.680
on the stand with him in
'36 when he opens the games.

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:48.220
The ideology of this
regime is amazing.

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:53.920
It is consistent and
very adventurous.

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.970
Speer became the
minister of munitions

00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:01.540
towards the end of the
war, and talks in his book

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:05.050
about the relationship
between how much money it

00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:08.320
costs to build and how much
money it costs to destroy.

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:15.030
It's interesting, again, that he
would put that into perspective

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:20.467
as the Reich was declining,
and it was clear to him

00:50:20.467 --> 00:50:21.675
that they were going to fail.

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:34.960
Another comparison, which
is interesting-- comparisons

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:35.740
go on forever.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:43.040
One of the major buildings
in the North axis

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:50.600
of the new center for
Berlin is a domed hall.

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:56.465
This domed hall is 825 feet
diameter, which is colossal.

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:02.705
St. Peter's would fit
into it a couple of times.

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:09.950
150,000 people could be
accommodated standing--

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:16.490
how do you get such a size?

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:30.560
Well, Hitler thought it
necessary to explain to me

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.270
that the size of
the meeting hall

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:35.820
should be governed by
medieval conceptions.

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:36.320
in.

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.860
The cathedral town of
[INAUDIBLE],, for instance,

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:43.280
in southern Germany, 30,000
square feet of area--

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:50.400
when there were only 15,000
people living in all.

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.650
He used that relationship--

00:51:52.650 --> 00:52:00.330
150,000 people for a size hall
for a city of a few million

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:02.640
people is absolutely correct.

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.880
There's a tendency in
professional practice

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:16.050
to constantly demonstrate
relationships.

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:19.530
I do it all the time.

00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:22.510
I'm embarrassed often
when I'm doing it.

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:29.970
I'll say this is 3/4 of the
length of the last highway

00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:33.085
which was built under
Roosevelt or whatever.

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.220
It establishes for
your clients a kind

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:43.320
of sense of location in time.

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.640
It's often foolish.

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.790
What is the relationship
between Eisenhower's building

00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:50.820
of roads and the modern road.

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:56.940
But comparisons have a
funny kind of effect.

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:58.500
They stabilize.

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:01.140
They put you in touch
with a realm larger

00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:02.820
than your own realm.

00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:07.590
Often that's, for a fascist,
a great achievement.

00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:17.150
Hitler speaks
elegantly of his visits

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:20.300
to the Vienna Opera
when he was a student.

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:26.310
He talks about gone is the
interior of the French opera

00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:29.290
when he visits Paris in 1940.

00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:32.400
This is the constant
notion that if you

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:36.930
are in a position of power,
you have to not only relate

00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:40.650
yourself to other people you've
been in a position of power,

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:42.510
but you have to exceed them.

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:49.470
There's an algorithm which moves
in the direction of larger,

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:57.040
better, different, more
powerful, and so on.

00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:01.450
So Nazism was as much--

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:05.220
the ideology as expressed
in spatial terms

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:17.460
was as much to do with
an evolutionary idea

00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:22.990
that we are here to change time.

00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:26.130
We are here to
influence time, and we

00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:30.480
are going to do it through
spatial comparison.

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:56.560
If you look at this
map, there are large--

00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:07.670
150,000-- technologists
have done some--

00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:12.050
Hitler actually put
down the foundations

00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:14.660
for some of these buildings.

00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:22.370
And environmental
engineers now calculate

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:29.600
that this domed building with
150,000, 180,000 people in,

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:33.530
it would start raining inside
the building because of the--

00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:38.630
it would have to be
air conditioned to take

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:41.930
care of the advent of rain.

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:45.260
You see some curious things.

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:46.490
There are cinemas.

00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:47.870
There are opera houses.

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:51.770
There are concert
halls all spread

00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:55.280
throughout-- from this
railway station in the bottom,

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:58.880
through the Triumphal Arch which
was borrowed from Napoleon,

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:01.250
but many times
bigger than Napoleon.

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:03.250
There's millions of
signatures on it.

00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:19.060
There's a philharmonic hall.

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:21.940
Berlin still as the best
Philharmonic orchestra

00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:23.900
in the world.

00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:26.660
The Reich's opera is next door.

00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:30.895
There's a hotel-- there are
various number of hotels.

00:56:30.895 --> 00:56:36.730
There are restaurants
and museums.

00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:39.395
There's a large amount of
culture built into the system.

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:48.390
Except for residents
and industry,

00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:53.400
it virtually produces
all the forms of a town--

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.050
all the uses of a town.

00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:03.660
What's wrong with this?

00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:22.150
Could you imagine this being
built, and after the war

00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:28.960
the ruler is imprisoned or dies.

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:33.430
And this is taken over by a
new liberal city of Berlin.

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:37.780
And Starbucks is
located somewhere.

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:44.990
And the Pritzker hotel
family are in here somewhere.

00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:56.700
We reuse elements
of our special world

00:57:56.700 --> 00:58:00.825
which have punished
people in the past.

00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:07.170
We think very little
of taking an old prison

00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:11.250
and modifying it into
residential accommodation today

00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:14.350
although there's a little
bit of a stigma attached.

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:21.150
But there's no stigma attached
to taking Christian church

00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:23.535
and making it into a
restaurant in Newton.

00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:31.520
So transformability is possible
under all circumstances.

00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:38.040
Could something at
this five mile scale

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:40.860
be transformed over time--

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:42.075
partially in part?

00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:55.530
Could a personality environment
ever be changed formally.

00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:59.100
You go to one of the buildings
in the world I like most,

00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:03.810
The Ducal Palace in Urbino,
if you go into the basement,

00:59:03.810 --> 00:59:13.650
you see the qualities
that the servants

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:17.880
must have endured in crushing
ice for this great Ducal

00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:20.340
family.

00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:23.100
I don't evaluate
the Ducal Palace

00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:27.630
on the basis of the tragic
condition of the labor which

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:31.510
must keep the place in order.

00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:32.930
So what are your standards?

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.295
Memory plays a part in this.

00:59:46.295 --> 00:59:46.795
Memory.

00:59:50.310 --> 00:59:54.230
is kept alive through
monuments, memorials.

00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:57.290
We'll do a class on memory
later on in this class

00:59:57.290 --> 01:00:00.590
because it's become a much
more interesting aspect

01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:01.730
of this discourse.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:13.055
There's no memory
embedded in this project.

01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:26.930
Shingle is not reintroduced
or played upon spatially.

01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:29.800
It's an ultimate
controlled environment.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.920
For Jews and gay people
and gypsies and others

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:46.480
who suffered enormously under
the process of this regime,

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.770
it's difficult to talk
about this without involving

01:00:50.770 --> 01:00:52.440
procedural questions.

01:00:56.060 --> 01:01:00.383
There's a wonderful book in
the Holocaust literature on--

01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:07.420
gosh, what's the town--

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:15.156
death camp in Poland on the--

01:01:15.156 --> 01:01:17.880
AUDIENCE: Buchenwald,
Auschwitz, Dachau

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.630
JULIAN BEINART: No,
it's not one of those.

01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:23.530
It's far to the East.

01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:27.384
It's-- oh, Christ.

01:01:27.384 --> 01:01:28.240
AUDIENCE: Treblinka?

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.360
JULIAN BEINART: Treblinka.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.340
Treblinka.

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:36.780
There's a book by a man called
Steiner whose parents died

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:37.590
in Treblinka.

01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:42.600
He interviewed some
of the old people

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:48.390
who escaped from Treblinka
towards the end of its life.

01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:50.850
And he asked the question,
which is often asked

01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:55.920
of the Jews, why
they didn't rebel,

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.250
why they just took it all.

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:03.900
And he tells the
story of this being

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:07.650
the phenomena in Treblinka
until a certain point,

01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:11.460
around 1940 or
somewhere, where they

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:16.320
started worrying that maybe
the Nazi regime was not

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.210
going to survive.

01:02:18.210 --> 01:02:20.760
And they started
taking down buildings,

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:24.750
rebuilding them as parks--

01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:30.300
planting grass, putting
up hedges, planting trees.

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:34.480
And the Jews, at that point,
couldn't take it any longer.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:38.790
They were afraid that the
memory of the death situation

01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:41.430
would not be--

01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:44.790
there would be no evidence.

01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:50.760
And on that basis, they
engineered the first revolt--

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.000
most were killed.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.820
So the whole issue
of memory, how long

01:02:56.820 --> 01:03:04.620
it can maintain itself, is the
memory of this building system

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:08.610
separable from the memory
of the ideology which

01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:10.050
perpetrated death?

01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:16.970
These are questions
of meaning, which are

01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:18.590
very difficult to deal with.

01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:29.790
Let's look briefly,
very briefly,

01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:35.980
at the regime of St. Petersburg.

01:03:40.310 --> 01:03:46.670
St. Petersburg--
the Nevsky Prospekt

01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:54.260
is one arm of three
spokes which emanate

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:56.360
from the center at the water.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.510
You've got a plan
in front of you.

01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:10.340
The plan is anchored at its
beginning by 2 connections.

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:18.380
The one to the symmetry
of Alexander Nevsky,

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:22.670
the 19-year-old who
saved Russia in 1240

01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:24.860
from invasion from the North.

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:28.280
The other one is to the
interior of Moscow--

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:33.010
to the interior of
Russia and Moscow.

01:04:33.010 --> 01:04:39.290
The axis on which the building
ends is the Admiralty building.

01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:43.370
Peter was obsessed
with water and ships.

01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:48.830
When he became czar toward
the end of the 18th century,

01:04:48.830 --> 01:04:51.770
he tried to build a
Russian fleet which

01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:57.870
could then go down the
Volga towards the Black Sea.

01:04:57.870 --> 01:05:00.410
He was beaten up and failed.

01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:03.200
He then turned to Europe.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:06.170
And this was one
of his openings--

01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:08.100
to Europe he shifted.

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:13.110
He never liked Moscow
because like Louis XV,

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:18.995
one of his relatives was killed
in Moscow in the Kremlin.

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:26.780
He then did one of the most
manic things ever done--

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:30.530
let's try to build a
city the equivalent of it

01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:32.780
North would be like
the United States

01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:36.012
like building its
capital on Hudson Bay.

01:05:36.012 --> 01:05:39.380
It's so far North,
the word [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:41.435
is a swamp in Finnish.

01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:48.190
Hundreds of thousands of
people died in the building

01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:51.730
of this strange city.

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:55.360
He had to impose taxes on
people entering the city,

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:59.440
that they had to carry
stones with them.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:02.320
It's a remarkable story.

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:07.180
It's axis between the water,
the admiralty building,

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:12.115
and the history of Russia.

01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:19.920
They are two crossing
water bodies--

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:23.295
the Fontanka and the Moika.

01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:33.860
The Moika is where, in one
of the days of the 1917

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:38.000
revolution, the mob
came down the street,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.530
and there were Russian
czarist military

01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:44.930
waiting for them at this point.

01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:49.170
And in a significant
gesture, the Russian military

01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:51.630
didn't fire on the mob.

01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:54.410
There is today a
cinema on that point

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:57.680
called the [INAUDIBLE] Cinema.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.840
So this is an
environment much older

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:05.570
than Hitler's, but where
time has already intervened

01:07:05.570 --> 01:07:07.610
and changed the use.

01:07:07.610 --> 01:07:10.880
Many of the great palaces--

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.560
the Belozersky Palace.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:21.530
the Stroganoff Palace,
the Mikhailovskiy Palace

01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:23.930
are now museums.

01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:27.980
St. Petersburg has
a higher proportion

01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:31.010
of square footage in
museums as opposed

01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:34.700
to population than any
city in the world--

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:38.690
largely because they take over
so many of the great palaces

01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:39.710
under Sovietism.

01:07:43.790 --> 01:07:46.170
The water is
constantly a factor.

01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:54.620
There's a bypass on the left
close to the Fontanka river

01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:56.700
back to the water.

01:07:56.700 --> 01:08:01.970
There's another one close
to Dvortsovaya Square

01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:05.210
where the road gives as
a bypass to the water.

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:13.100
On the building of the
public library, the Duma,

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:17.840
which is the city hall, the
Kazan Church, a bookstore,

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:22.460
a lady's store the Passage,
the Holland Church --

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:26.060
almost everything that
you-- the Alexander Theater,

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.370
public library, so on.

01:08:40.819 --> 01:08:44.410
What about Alexander Nevsky?

01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:52.720
Peter the Great tsar
was a cruel man.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:09:03.330
He imposed no liberty on
his civilian population.

01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:05.820
He built a city
at enormous cost.

01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:14.270
Nevsky Prospekt,
unlike Hitler's, is

01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:15.920
anchored in Russian history.

01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:22.740
It's modern history related
to the water and to--

01:09:32.010 --> 01:09:36.699
Alexander built the
beginnings of the Russian army

01:09:36.699 --> 01:09:37.574
and the Russian Navy.

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:49.500
It's another-- first of all,
it has mixed uses on it.

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:51.069
Well, so does Hitler's.

01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:55.470
I just spoke about the number of
cinemas and performance halls.

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:01.660
So that doesn't distinguish.

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:07.060
What distinguishes between
the two roads as expressions?

01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:16.150
The reference to
Hitler's practice--

01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:25.570
ideological practice renders his
treatment of the center Berlin

01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:28.150
highly suspect.

01:10:28.150 --> 01:10:31.150
You cannot divorce the two.

01:10:31.150 --> 01:10:35.990
Over time who knows what will
happen to the memory of Hitler.

01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:44.420
In another 100 years our future
will be as much of a building

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:48.440
to be visited by the great,
great, great, great, great,

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:51.570
great, great, great
grandchildren of the people

01:10:51.570 --> 01:10:52.070
who died.

01:10:56.420 --> 01:11:02.730
This is the first panopticon
of Bentham, the British liberal

01:11:02.730 --> 01:11:05.375
who considered the idea.

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:14.590
Plan for shipyard's-- again
where controlling system

01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:16.465
emanates from a
central position.

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:28.650
Lecture on the
evils of alcoholism

01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:30.645
in the auditorium
of Fresnes Prison.

01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:40.370
Here is a prison in Illinois.

01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:45.005
Not many American panopticon
prisons were built. Next.

01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:52.350
Mexico seemed to be keen--

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:57.830
the revised panopticon on the
right is a national stamp.

01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:58.330
Next.

01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:03.395
Chaux, the original plans--

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.180
Arch of Saline on
the left and right.

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:11.680
Next.

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:24.260
The [INAUDIBLE]---- the
fact that you can see

01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:30.280
the director's house at the back
at the same time as you enter--

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:33.190
a connection between the two.

01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:33.690
Next.

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:44.040
Decoration of the
director's house.

01:12:47.335 --> 01:12:47.835
Next.

01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:54.570
And these are two
other projects.

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:57.170
This is a house for
an intellectual.

01:12:57.170 --> 01:13:03.810
Again, the typological exhibit
for a character consideration

01:13:03.810 --> 01:13:05.820
of a person as a type.

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:12.970
What is different between a
house for an intellectual--

01:13:12.970 --> 01:13:15.850
other than you may
have a large library--

01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:18.580
and any other house?

01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:20.805
Here is a maison de plaisir--

01:13:20.805 --> 01:13:22.840
a kind of pleasure palace--

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:30.430
again, with a kind of
centripetal organization.

01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:31.815
Next.

01:13:31.815 --> 01:13:35.050
The extension of this idea--

01:13:35.050 --> 01:13:48.020
this is a hospital in Paris
as it's grown over time--

01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:51.970
added on to by piece
by piece by piece.

01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:55.230
This is a computation
entry for rebuilding of it.

01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:58.530
Now there are two
dominant forces.

01:13:58.530 --> 01:14:00.640
The one is the
church at the top.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.910
The other one is the
entry at the bottom.

01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:06.840
Everything else is
segmented and fixed in place

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:10.390
and open to observation.

01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:15.345
Behavior is now frozen as
it is in the panopticon.

01:14:15.345 --> 01:14:15.845
Next.

01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:24.800
Same device for
children's school

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:30.080
and an example of the
separation of house and work.

01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:38.300
Each being a domain,
which is individually

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:40.170
separated from the other.

01:14:40.170 --> 01:14:40.670
Next.

01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:47.770
Hitler did much of
drawing himself.

01:14:47.770 --> 01:14:53.180
Here he's in Paris, late
1940, with Speer next to him.

01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:53.680
Next.

01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:01.600
"Did This Art Student's
Failure Change History?"

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:05.140
Well, yes.

01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:13.325
This is Hitler's own drawing
of the large domed hall.

01:15:13.325 --> 01:15:13.825
Next.

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.700
The Arch of Triumph--

01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:22.170
the axis to the doomed
hall, and this 400

01:15:22.170 --> 01:15:26.880
foot wide avenue on either side.

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:30.195
A good decoration to the
avenue, wall of guns.

01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:33.160
Next.

01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:38.370
You've got them.

01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:40.880
OK.

01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:42.860
Hitler's sketch of
the Triumphal Arch.

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:45.845
He could draw quite well.

01:15:45.845 --> 01:15:46.345
Next.

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:57.710
Nevsky Prospekt, the
yellow stripe on the--

01:15:57.710 --> 01:16:02.300
leading from the admiralty
building to Alexander Nevsky.

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:07.850
The other two spokes added
later lead to the barricades,

01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:08.450
to the army.

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:15.080
OK.

01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:16.160
Next.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:19.320
We'll go for a walk
down this street.

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:22.940
This is the Nevsky Prospekt
with the admiralty building

01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:25.360
at the end--

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.640
day and night.

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:27.140
Next.

01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:39.180
This is the Railway
Station Hotel to Moscow

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:41.485
to the center of the country.

01:16:41.485 --> 01:16:41.985
Next.

01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:53.935
A small church which is
turned into a subway stop.

01:16:53.935 --> 01:16:54.435
Next.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.050
A Fontanka water crossing--

01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:08.085
the Menshikov
Palace on the left--

01:17:08.085 --> 01:17:08.585
Next.

01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:17.080
The Belozersky Palace,
the Passage store--

01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:19.970
Next.

01:17:25.150 --> 01:17:28.090
It is Alexander Library--

01:17:28.090 --> 01:17:34.480
this is Alexander Library on
a small road which leads off

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.545
the Prospekt to the water.

01:17:36.545 --> 01:17:37.045
Next.

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:47.410
The Duma-- the central
city headquarters.

01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:47.910
Next.

01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:57.120
The Duma-- I'm sorry, this
is the Kazan Cathedral.

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:58.950
Next.

01:17:58.950 --> 01:18:03.060
I just give you a sense of the
enclosure-- the facade, next.

01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:11.150
The Moika crossing,
[INAUDIBLE] Cinema,

01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:15.560
a bypass to the Dvortsovaya
Square on the right.

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.680
Next.

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.000
Dostoevsky said,
St. Petersburg is

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.110
the most intentional and
abstract city in history.

01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:30.470
Dostoevsky was in
prison across the river.

01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:36.290
I'll start on Thursday
finishing this story--

01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:41.380
just raising some questions
about what this all means.
