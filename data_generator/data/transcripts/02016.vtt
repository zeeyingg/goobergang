00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.850
PROFESSOR: So now let's
talk about viruses,

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.410
which is our main focus
in these lectures.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.500
So viruses are very
different from bacteria,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.530
because they are pathogens which
infect the cells of your body.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.790
And so they themselves are
not large cellular organisms,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.430
but in fact have a
different biology.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.720
So they consist
of virions, which

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:44.150
are a capsid form of the virus,
which contains a strand of RNA,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.200
which is some genetic material
that, when this capsid is then

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.460
integrated into the host cell,
the RNA can basically activate

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.150
to infect that cell, and also
replicate itself and make

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.460
some more virions, which
can spread out and infect

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.780
additional cells.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.660
So the basic entity that
we're worried about here

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.710
is really a small object, which
is often shaped like a sphere,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.010
or maybe it's an
ellipsoid, the virion.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.850
And it's much, much smaller.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.539
So the typical size is
really on the order --

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.910
the radius, let's say -- is on
the order of 100 nanometers.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.650
So that is 0.1 micron or less,
so much smaller than even

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.070
the smallest aerosol droplets
that we can easily observe.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.320
So they're extremely tiny.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.660
There's a couple examples
we can think about,

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.350
which are famous examples.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.750
So one class of viruses
cause the disease measles.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.840
And measles has a virus
shape, as you can see here,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.160
which is not quite spherical but
usually a little bit elongated,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.320
like an ellipsoid,
and has a typical size

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.479
of 100 to 300
nanometers in diameter.

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.120
So measles is still a
very active disease,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.370
which we have been
controlling for a long time

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.690
with vaccinations.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.170
But despite that, there
were still, in 2018,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.210
114,000 deaths
worldwide from measles.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.180
And it's estimated that in
the eight years before that --

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.700
actually, in the 20 years
before that, excuse me --

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.030
that the vaccine has saved
around 23 million lives that

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.160
would be lost otherwise
if this virus were

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.720
allowed to propagate.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.660
And measles -- it is
known to be airborne.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.350
So this is the classic example
of an airborne transmission.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.380
It's been studied
by, for example,

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.230
Riley in the 1970s,
who demonstrated

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.210
measles transmission in
schools and in other settings.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.700
And from our perspective,
in this lecture,

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.579
it's not surprising.

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.680
These viruses or
virions are so small,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.890
they can be contained in
the smallest droplets, which

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.150
are easily present
in the air for hours,

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.460
and so they are
not settling out.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.400
So what's of much more
interest to us today

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.070
is the family of coronaviruses.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.570
So coronaviruses look
very similar to this one,

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.240
but they have these
proteins that stick out,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.790
which we've all
seen, that look a bit

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.670
like a crown, or a corona.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.410
And they still have
an RNA on the inside.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.270
And there's lots of different
human coronaviruses.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.220
So there are the standard
human coronaviruses,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.530
which cause the common cold.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.700
And there are four typical
human coronaviruses

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.370
that cause common colds
that we all experience,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.579
and more serious pneumonias,
but generally not

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.500
life-threatening illnesses.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.110
But there are variations of the
coronavirus mutations, which

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.870
are constantly coming
into contact with humans

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.060
and can cause much
more serious diseases.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.700
So in recent memory, we've had
the Severe Acute Respiratory

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.600
Syndrome coronavirus.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.250
And there was a big outbreak,
reasonably big outbreak

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.700
around 2003, that
started also in China.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.910
And it infected around 8,000
people, and about 800 died.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.910
So It was a fairly lethal
disease, about 10% mortality,

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.540
but fortunately, it
didn't spread too widely.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.480
More recently, there was
the Middle East Respiratory

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.300
Syndrome coronavirus,
which was in 2012.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.930
And this led, over the couple
of years after that as well,

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.790
to around 2,500 cases
and around 850 deaths.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.060
So again, an outbreak that
was potentially very serious

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.140
but remained controlled and
was primarily in Saudi Arabia.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:59.520
And then we come to SARS-CoV-2,
which, we all know the story.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.350
So this is the
novel coronavirus,

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:08.010
which appeared in Wuhan,
China, in December 2019,

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.140
and then led to the
present global pandemic,

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.460
which so far has claimed
almost a million deaths.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.510
So as of today, which
is September 24,

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.890
it's around 976,000
deaths worldwide.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.760
And the confirmed cases are
currently at about 3.8 million,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.630
which is a reasonable fraction
of the world's population,

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.760
around 7 billion.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.850
So what we can
understand from all this

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.700
is that these are
very small objects.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.590
They cannot swim.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.830
And so they are just sort
of floating in droplets.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.880
And so, of course, they
can be in small droplets.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.650
And as we'll discussed
next, you can

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.780
imagine that they're
actually more

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.460
infectious in those
small droplets,

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.450
because they can more easily get
out and reach host cells when

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:58.560
they're transmitted.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.720
Moreover, small
droplets are much easier

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.790
to get deep into your
respiratory system,

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.070
into the smallest
cavities of your lungs,

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.040
where there's a high surface
area for that interaction

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.980
to take place.
