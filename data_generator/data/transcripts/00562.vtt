00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:37.120
JULIAN BEINART: I want to tackle
another interesting and rather

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.880
confounding issue in relation
to the space and social content

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.380
of cities.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:02.490
And that has to do with the fact
that not all people in society

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:09.000
agree with the ideology that the
city maintains for the moment,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.190
or the society maintains
for the moment.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.670
To change the world is an
ambition of many people,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.440
or groups of people, who believe
that they can artificially

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.700
create environment which of
a higher order of goodness

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.390
than the environment with
which they now are presented.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.430
Often, these situations
come about as a reaction

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.175
to something negative
about the existing city.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.050
We will go through
a number of these.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.010
Obviously, this is a very
large subject, again,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.570
and needs a need for me to
make a few arguments about it

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.570
rather than ending with
the complete bibliographic

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.420
explanation of all
of the attempts

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.940
to identify the
intentional communities

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.680
within the Metropolitan area of
cities or isolated from them.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.630
The word utopia has
a double meaning.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.490
In Greek, utopia means no place.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:41.020
Utopia means that you, the
single you, is a good place.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.390
Already the double
Greek word meaning

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.230
indicates some characteristics
of which we have to deal with.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.110
The created environment
in these cases

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.080
are meant to create
a good world,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.550
but they also are isolated.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.760
The word is first
used in English

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.680
by Thomas Moore's
book in 1516, where

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.210
he describes a utopian island.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.570
It's an island which
already indicates

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.570
that it's separate
from other existing

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.960
phenomena, physical phenomena.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.330
Secondly, it has 58 spacious and
splendid cities on the island.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.480
The island is 200 miles long.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.140
There's equity of
property enable.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.330
The houses are never locked.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.380
No private possessions
are tolerated.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.760
The owners change
every 10 years,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.770
and they're selected
by drawing lots.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.890
So really, you find in the first
of the utopian explanations,

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.920
or exercises, as
association with equity,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.100
that this is a place where
private property is not

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.480
significant.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.540
There's a random distribution
statistically made available

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.000
through the drawing of lots.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.800
Many of these themes involving
a boundary condition involving

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.320
the distribution of
resources, involving

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.980
the maintenance of the
society are characteristics

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.870
of these ideal communities.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.850
[INAUDIBLE] more right of
the ideal state or about

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.860
the new island of nowhere.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.060
There's a notion
that this environment

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.930
can exist in a sense nowhere,
which means that he doesn't

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.710
touch another environment.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:24.840
There's an interesting linkage
of people during this time.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.290
For instance, looking
back with the great book

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:37.450
by Edward Bellamy, in
the 1850s, describing

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.980
Boston as a communist city,
mechanically controlled

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.000
communist city, in
which a man falls

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.180
asleep and wakes up 100 years
later and he sees Boston

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.900
transformed.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.245
Mechanism is an
important attribute

00:05:59.245 --> 00:06:02.570
to that changed environment.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.930
So compelling was the book
that it sold millions of copies

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.250
here in the United States.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.540
It was a bestseller.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.530
It was read by a man called
William Morris in England.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.490
William Morris was a
great [INAUDIBLE] founder

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.010
of the socialist
league in England,

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.850
a man of enormous
significance, who

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:35.190
wrote a book called
News From Nowhere,

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:43.650
completely antithetical to the
concentrated vision of Bellamy.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.460
For him, a decentralist
solution which

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.570
abdicated the role of
cities with the option.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.400
For here, at the same time, we
have two 19th century figures

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.210
not in contact with each
other, but their works

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.710
are in contact with each other.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.140
The one comments on the
other's by writing a book.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:14.400
News From Nowhere also refers
to Samuel Butler's book Erewhon,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.260
and Erewhon is an
anagram of nowhere.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.210
I'm just trying to indicate
to you the density of interest

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.540
in this phenomenon.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.640
The 19th century
which is our focus

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.600
is the century of
great expectations.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.890
Much though enormous
problems were manifest.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:50.700
There was a sense that, given
the right kind of conditions,

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.120
solutions would be found.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.960
Great Expectations is
again a novel by whom?

00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.940
Who?

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:05.310
Dickens, Charles Dickens,
it's hes 13th novel.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:09.090
What happens in
Great Expectations?

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.930
A young orphan by
the name of Pip

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.350
encountered wonders in
a field and encounters

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.320
an escaped convict.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.740
His life is then is the
subject of this book.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:29.070
It's a book about how you can as
an orphan encounter an escaped

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.560
convict and still make
a success of things.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:43.070
Many of these utopias are
subject to the creation

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.370
of new models of
social relationship as

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.590
antithetical to what exists.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:55.980
If the family is
weak, the kibbutz

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.660
takes children and separates
them from their families

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.920
and rears them separately.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.130
So there's a
[INAUDIBLE] an Institute

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.530
for the Promotion
of Social Character

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.440
in New Lanark, Scotland.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:18.270
So does the French
utopianists [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.450
in [INAUDIBLE],,
all of these places

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.360
have environments where
children can grow up

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.960
independent of the family.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.970
The notion of in loco
parentis is established

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:40.330
to provide the rights for
people who look after children

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.585
separate from their family.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:51.100
If the society exhibits
great Puritanism,

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.390
as Victorian society
did, Charles Fourier

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:59.440
proposed his utopian
project, the phalanstery,

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.130
on the notion of
passion, sexual passion.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.130
Humphrey Noyes in
the United States

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:12.320
is personally somebody
to be hugged and created

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.435
Oneida, the town of
Oneida, in New York state.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:25.960
If drink and alienation
and drugs are the problem,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.630
Owen's reform of character--

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.150
Institute for the Reform
of Character in New Lanark.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.980
Pullman explicitly
says, I will not

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:42.990
allow my workers to own
houses, because that

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.390
will mean they will
become separate and want

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.350
to live an independent life.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:54.300
I want them to behave according
to the rules, which I said.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.150
This is paternalism,
which of course, resulted

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.520
in complete decay
of the community.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:12.430
If the outside world is a
new secular world changing

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:16.540
very rapidly, the
response of the Shakers

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:21.820
is to create a religion
which remains absolute.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.730
No sexual intercourse
is allowed in

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.300
[? Shakerdom, ?] which
creates a fundamental problem

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.150
of population increase.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.330
So it has to convert people.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:39.580
The notion of converting
people because you have a truth

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:44.800
is fundamental to
certain religions today.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.660
I dislike the idea intensely,
but that's a personal dislike.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:54.310
So I should dislike Mormonism,
which believes in it.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:59.230
One good thing about the Jews is
they don't sell their religion.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.270
Or they maybe do
it in subtle ways,

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:06.220
but they don't missionarize.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.460
Missionarism is an
interesting phenomenon,

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:14.215
but it's only the result of a
belief in an absolute truth.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:24.630
If industrial chaos is what
we encounter in the existing

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.770
world, you'll find
the paternal order

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:34.080
of factory towns of
Pullman outside Chicago,

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:39.000
South of Chicago; Port Sunlight,
the factory town of the Lever

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.220
Brothers in England, Bournville,
the factory town of the Cadbury

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.000
family, and so on.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.510
If you believe the
result of the chaos

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:56.880
is centralized
order or disorder,

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.440
you opt for options
for decentralization.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:07.470
William Morris believes
that over time, Manchester

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.800
and London would
disappear and be replaced

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:16.890
by a small-scale,
self-supporting, landscaped

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:24.910
environment, which I'll detail
a little later in the class.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:29.200
Or you believe in the
work of Peter Kropotkin,

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.580
the first urban geographer,
the Russian Prince

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:38.350
who disagreed with Marx
about the new state,

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:44.680
arguing that a centralized state
was likely to fail in favor

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.140
of a decentralized order.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:51.400
He argued that even during
his stay in England--

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.420
I can't remember the date-- at
the end of the 19th century,

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.630
he said that 80%
of the factories

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.750
only employed 8 to 10 people.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:06.920
He was enormously impressed by
the Jura region of Switzerland,

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:13.050
J-U-R-A, which is the home
environment of Le Corbusier,

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.880
by the way.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.290
What impresses Kropotkin
is the capacity

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.690
of watchmaking to
organize itself there.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:27.780
There are many enterprises,
all small, all competitive, all

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:28.980
producing good product.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:40.580
So his referenced to industrial
chaos is agglomeration.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:45.020
And he disputes
agglomeration economics

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.980
as fundamental to the production
of first-class industrial

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.590
product.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.710
That's just the list
of the antidotes.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:15:08.060
And the-- I'm just going to
go through, very briefly,

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.320
some more characteristics
of these places.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.700
There's often an
authoritarian order socially,

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.591
but they're
economically democratic.

00:15:20.591 --> 00:15:25.250
The authority is necessary
to maintain the tension

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:32.280
and to distract
from the attraction

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.325
of the outside world.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:41.340
There's no question
of choice here.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.250
If choice is economic,
well, that's OK.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.760
But if it's social,
it's dangerous.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:54.870
These projects all
have boundary problems.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:16:00.300
They need to be separate, but
they can't exist separately.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:05.000
The Shakers need new
inputs of population.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.610
They often need--
many of them are

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:16.650
agricultural and industrial
businesses, which

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:21.090
is the economic base,
and they need markets.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:27.440
You can't eat your own food
and maintain yourself totally.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.950
You need a means, something
to change, producing income.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.140
You get what?

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.440
These places don't
locate in the wilderness.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.640
But they're located in
the middle landscape,

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:48.090
which Frank Lloyd Wright
understands very well.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.690
His the notion of
usonianism is really

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:55.970
a way of dealing with
the middle landscape.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:17:02.950
He built 615 houses in Oak
Park and the Unity Church

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.990
in this middle landscape.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.920
I'll deal with
Broadacre City a bit

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.110
later on, when we're
dealing with Wright himself.

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:19.369
The difficulty about how
to be yourself and yet

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:21.530
be a part of a
group, how to change

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.930
and yet to remain the same.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:28.160
Many of the critics of these
intentional communities

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:35.970
talk about how rigid, fixed,
without much process--

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.240
they are wooden, mechanical,
contrived, inanimate.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:47.590
I visited the drug
rehabilitation commune

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:51.310
north of San Francisco
called Synanon.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:59.170
Synanon was dealing with people
fighting heroin addiction.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.390
We were met at the
airport with people

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:08.410
dressed in black leather
on black motorcycles

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:11.270
and escorted to Synanon.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.100
Synanon was headed by
a man, a single man,

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:20.230
who had a mad impulse that
the only way to cure heroin

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:25.150
was to be as tough
as the drug itself.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.630
In theory, it was a
fascist community.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:31.960
If he decided that you
shouldn't have wives,

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.130
you don't have wives.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.800
If he decided that
people should--

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.460
one morning, he wakes up, and
says there'll be no smoking.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.420
There'll be no smoking.

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:50.870
At the same time, Synanon
had people in it--

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.720
drug addicts who are
highly confident people

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.610
other than their addiction.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:59.690
Lawyers, businessmen
who lived in Synanon,

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:04.370
because it was a better
option than anywhere else

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.720
there to live.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.680
He organized them so
that they made money.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:16.130
They would get up early in the
morning and call businesses all

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:21.470
over the United States,
arguing that Synanon

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.630
was a charitable organization.

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.260
They sold pencils with
Synanon on the pencil.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:40.910
They were so tough that
they enabled a lawsuit

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:44.420
against one of the San
Francisco newspapers

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.610
for talking about them.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:50.180
They became so fascist
that the lawyer that

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:54.770
was employed in Los Angeles
who worked for the newspaper

00:19:54.770 --> 00:20:00.710
in the lawsuit discovered a
snake in his mailbox one day.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:02.510
The community destroyed itself.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:14.290
The story here is you have
to be very powerful socially

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:18.610
in order to maintain
the distance between you

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:22.270
and the existing environment,
which you're finding

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.640
incompatible and dangerous.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:30.060
This is an endless struggle.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:39.000
You can go as far as
to make the community

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.690
as insular as possible.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:46.500
The Shakers controlled
the physical form

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.020
of their environment absolutely.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.380
All meat was cut
into square pieces.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.610
They were places
where you could only--

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.540
certain places we could
hang your clothes.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:02.220
You weren't allowed to embrace
somebody of the other sex.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.870
You weren't allowed
to shake hands

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.370
with a foreigner, a stranger.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:10.290
And so endless
epicurean qualities.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:19.530
Let me just go on.

00:21:27.855 --> 00:21:29.480
An interesting theme
here is that we're

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:34.070
both interested in
space and society.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:38.240
This is a good opportunity for
us to look at these experiments

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.530
as dealing with both.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:47.420
The extraordinary thing
is that very seldom

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:52.910
do change occur on both fronts.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:56.570
There's an enormous
physical design conservatism

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.700
in many of these places.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:09.290
Fourier's phalanstery, in
taking the versions which

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:13.420
are propagated, looked
like Versailles.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:17.300
They are large,
palace-like structures,

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.490
learning and innovation in them
is the invention of something

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:22.490
called a rue interieure.

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:22.990
Interior.

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.790
The rue interieure is
a very simple system

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:47.100
whereby the staircase in
the section of a building

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.730
is public and open to everybody.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:56.130
So that you-- the idea of
mixing is a public act.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.770
The rue interieure
is found-- can

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.760
be found, as we'll see
after the spring vacation,

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:07.890
in many of the Russian
propositions from 1917 to '32.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:11.492
You'll also find it
in Corbusier's Unité

00:23:11.492 --> 00:23:17.025
d'Habitation in the center here
where commerce is proposed.

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.960
Corbusier will belong
to the same society

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.580
of intentional communities
as did Fourier.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.860
This notion between there
being a fixed quotient

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:48.510
for in which you could
operate economically,

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.470
you haven't got money.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.700
So how do you innovate
architecturally?

00:23:53.700 --> 00:24:01.560
I need to start in an old
building for which there's

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.910
no market.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:07.250
Squatting is part of
these communal intentions.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:14.610
We will see some examples
in the slides of projects

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:17.380
like Fountain Grove
in California,

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:22.770
which proposed building
an incredible apparatus

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:27.930
of Victorian architecture
in order to create--

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:33.200
attract a community of people.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:37.340
We'll look at the
work of a number

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.370
of these people in the slides.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:47.540
I've chosen three architects
to include in the discourse.

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:53.530
The three architects
are Tony Garnier,

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:59.860
the French utopianist who
designed a project called

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:04.570
the Cité Industrielle, who
really believes that you can

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:10.090
take the paternalistic factory
town and change it through

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:12.080
architecture.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.160
The second one is
Frank Lloyd Wright.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.800
By the way, Garnier believes--

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.800
was an anarchist who
believed that there

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.870
would be no law courts nor
police necessary in his town.

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.210
The second case is the
case of Frank Lloyd

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:34.540
Wright who really, his politics
are as loose as his buildings.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:37.070
He designed over 700 buildings.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:39.100
And we built over 700 buildings.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.310
So when I say
looseness, it means

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:46.930
not necessarily a pejorative,
but a description of the range

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.650
of work that he did.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.640
He is a man who
in Broadacre City

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:57.190
proposes that the American
citizen has a right to own

00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:00.190
five of five automobiles.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.800
At the same time, he
designed the projects,

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:08.530
the [INAUDIBLE] Center
for Chicago and builds

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:09.960
and proposes--

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:18.390
if he has a political philosophy
it's called democracy.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.410
He writes a book called The
Architecture of Democracy.

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:29.750
But he's really a supporter
of variations on the system.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:34.520
Usonia is really a version
of the middle landscape

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.220
in which the American has
the right to own a house,

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.840
have an automobile.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.280
But in Broadacre City, he
also has helicopters flying

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:47.240
over the town in his drawings.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.480
What that's about, he
admires Henry Ford.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.620
Because Henry Ford in
Muscle Shoals in Alabama

00:26:54.620 --> 00:27:01.130
proposes a 75-mile-long
city, which

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:04.580
didn't occur because the
United States government

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:10.610
under Senator Norris proposed in
1933 to do the Tennessee Valley

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:17.030
Authority rather than sell
the rights to Henry Ford.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:20.870
Henry Ford almost ran for--
as president of the United--

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:26.240
for the presidency of the
United States as a result.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.440
Again, there is an
instinct in Wright

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:36.230
always to look at the
opposite situation.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.570
Democracy involves freedom.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:43.280
Freedom can be assumed through
the manipulation of agriculture

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:49.130
and industry at the same time,
which is Ford's great mantra.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:53.450
Ford wanted to build a city in
which his workers would only

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:55.640
work half the day or
three quarters of the day

00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:00.260
and work in their own garden
and make food for themselves

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.580
for the rest of the day.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:12.570
So we can-- when we look at
Russia between 1917 and 1932,

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.270
you have the
extraordinary opportunity

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:18.840
of observing all
of the energy which

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:23.760
transforms spatial
propositions and also deals

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.650
with a completely
new social order.

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.080
Marx, of course,
disliked the idea

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.570
that his thinking was utopian.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:36.560
He said, my
dialectical studies are

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:42.170
based on the reality I study,
the stock market's prices

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.200
in the London Times
every morning.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:50.680
I'm dealing with
reality, not with utopia.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.510
He disliked Fourier.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:56.440
He called Fourier's
phalanstere a brothel.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:01.180
Although Fourier claimed he
was a socialist and so on.

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.350
Sorry, Anna.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:05.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:07.120
JULIAN BEINART: Yes, I've got--

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.470
I've done two.

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:11.470
Corbusier is the third.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:16.390
Corbusier is a more,
perhaps, complex story.

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:18.790
First of all, he's
European like Garnier.

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:24.770
He has enormous ambitions.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.090
I'm sorry I haven't got
my notes in front of me.

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:36.220
We'll get to him in a minute.

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:42.300
But the basic proposition
in Corbusier's case

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:48.390
is that the plan is the
object of discussion.

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:51.330
The plan is either
right or not right.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:54.090
[INAUDIBLE] plan
that he makes is

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:56.820
the result of
enormous social study

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.240
and enormous physical awareness.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.540
And that, once it is
right, it doesn't matter

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:07.050
what ideology it supports.

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:17.540
His first project-- he really
has three theoretical plans.

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:21.630
The first-- let's leave
Corbusier for a while.

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.590
I'll come back to
him in a minute.

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:26.390
I have to watch time because
there's a lot of stuff.

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:38.100
I think I'm going to skip
some of these observations.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:44.850
One of the interesting ones is
from a student in this class

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:53.500
in 1993 who writes
to me and says,

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.050
"A comment on today's
lecture remarks,

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:57.895
'Freud and utopia dreams.'

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:04.350
I was reminded of Italo
Calvino's book, Invisible

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:05.220
Cities."

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:10.080
And I quote, "With cities,
it is as with dreams.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.610
Everything imaginable
can be dreamed.

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:14.700
But even the most
unexpected dream

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:20.520
is a rebirth that conceals a
desire or its reverse, a fear.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:25.920
Cities, like dreams, are made
of desires and equally of fears.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.210
Even if the thread of
their discourse is secret,

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:32.940
their rules are absurd,
their perspectives deceitful,

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:37.070
and everything consumes
everybody else."

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:40.310
The student says, "Does
that mean the crazier

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:43.305
the expressed desire the
greater the perceived fear?"

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.770
And now to answer that.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:54.380
I mean, it's a very
interesting connected idea

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:58.940
which Calvino in his
brilliant asserts.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:16.080
There's also a work which
refers to perversion

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.190
as a form of utopia.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:25.950
In a book called
Perversion and Utopia,

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:35.950
there's a "essential
affinity between the utopian

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:39.340
and the perverse
in so far as both

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.070
seek to circumvent
the reality principle

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:45.310
which defines the
human condition.

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:48.550
Man has always endeavored to
go beyond the narrow limits

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:50.320
of his condition.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.510
Perversion is one of
the essential ways

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:55.510
and means he applies in
order to push forward

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:58.240
these frontiers of
what is possible

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.240
and to unsettle reality."

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:06.100
These are strange
associations with utopianism.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.080
They're not explicit.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:15.400
I mean, Fourier's
preoccupation with sexuality

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.230
is not homosexuality.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:20.860
It's not sexuality
amongst children.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.830
It's not sexuality with animals.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:28.620
So, therefore, in our code of
behavior, it's not perverse.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.440
It's about as tame
as Shakespeare

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.560
writing about Romeo and
Juliet as young people in love

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.390
with each other.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:42.250
Yet, if you argue that if
you wish to confront reality,

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:45.100
you have to go beyond
certain boundaries,

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:48.970
certainly, the rules of
what constitutes perversion

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:50.050
are there to be broken.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.530
I don't know many
social attempts

00:33:56.530 --> 00:34:02.020
to create perverse
communities in this sense.

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:05.080
Maybe they're not on the
record because they're

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.760
hidden like dreams.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:13.510
And the consequence
of fear is so great

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:18.310
that the notion that the
more you exaggerate yourself

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:22.540
and your options,
the more you indulge

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:26.950
fear because the
more the society--

00:34:29.825 --> 00:34:32.620
it's such a tense
argument that I don't

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.989
know what to say more about it.

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:40.370
Utopia has always been a
relatively gentle phenomenon.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:43.850
If we see a society
screwing up, let's get away,

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:45.440
make our own little thing.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.059
We'll suffer.

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:54.110
We'll cut our meat square or
we'll go to church every day

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:56.449
or we'll do whatever it is.

00:34:56.449 --> 00:35:03.180
We won't have sex
forever, whatever.

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:06.960
I'm talking as if I'm
talking about religion.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.340
There's a certain faith-based
notion involved in--

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:16.650
I mean, take Étienne Cabet,
the man whom I mentioned

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:22.410
in relation to Ildefons
Cerda in Barcelona.

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:31.390
Cabet envisioned an ideal
world called Altruria.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:39.970
And like many others, he
set out with 89 people--

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:43.930
89 French people--
to the United States

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:46.630
to build this ideal community.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:48.910
He bought some land
in New Orleans.

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:50.110
It didn't work.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:53.710
He went northwards
to Illinois and found

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:56.200
the Mormon community
of Nauvoo, which

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:02.470
had been in which had been
isolated as the Mormons trekked

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:06.910
through four cities on their way
to Salt Lake City and Brigham

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:07.975
Young found the truth.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.310
Cabet died miserably in Nauvoo.

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:22.920
His supporters in
Barcelona wrote and said,

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:23.930
can we come out?

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:27.790
And everything was horrific.

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:29.780
They couldn't
maintain themselves.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.990
They didn't understand
the United States.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:37.640
The United States was a great
place of experimentation.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:42.380
Robert Owen, after making
money in Manchester,

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:46.760
went to New Lanark in Scotland,
then came to the United States

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:52.000
and proposed ideal
square communities.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.620
There were 41
Fourier communities

00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:00.270
in the United States, one of
which is the most interesting

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:01.980
of all.

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:05.670
There's a town in
Wisconsin called Ripon.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:09.240
It's near Kenosha, Wisconsin.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:13.860
There was fully
a community there

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:17.310
which objected to the
fact that the United

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:23.250
States was slow in dealing
with slavery in the 1850s.

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:27.360
It said, we're going to form
a new political parity, which

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:33.120
is going to use the
premise of freedom.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.070
It formed a political party.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:38.160
Which one did it form?

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:41.850
The Republican Party, the
Republican Party in this

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:47.100
country was formed in
a Fourier sex-free--

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:52.110
no, sex-plus environment.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.810
The Ripon Society is
still one of the arms

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.775
of the contemporary
Republican Party.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:07.860
The United States attracted
other Fouriers like Victor

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:14.085
Considerant who built La
Réunion in Fort Worth, Texas.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:25.260
In fact, the USA was very
much seen as a promised land.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:34.490
Up to the Civil War, there
130 intentional different

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:35.940
communities.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:39.680
1860 to 1960, 200.

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:46.810
Post 1960, 2,000.

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:55.880
OK, let's look a bit more
carefully at some of these.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.110
Any questions?

00:39:04.315 --> 00:39:05.790
Why do these things fail?

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:17.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:21.750
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah,
the Mormons didn't fail.

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:23.080
The Mormons haven't failed.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:27.050
So I'm wrong in asserting--

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:33.030
I mean, I suppose I
shouldn't confuse secular

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:36.740
with religious communities.

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:43.140
In a sense all religion is a
utopia, promises eschatology,

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.630
afterlife--

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:50.340
which is a utopian notion
because nobody has ever--

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:53.280
we don't know if anybody has
ever experienced heaven or not.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.710
Heaven is an
intellectual construct

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:59.250
in the view from the human mind.

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:01.770
And the promise of
eschatology, both

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:05.880
in all of the major religions
except for Buddhism.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:10.990
I don't know what Buddhism
promises after death.

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:13.095
I have Buddhists in this class.

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:28.920
Let's just talk a little
more about some of the--

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.600
some of these propositions.

00:40:34.392 --> 00:40:37.990
AUDIENCE: So why did
this utopia fail?

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:39.310
JULIAN BEINART: Which one?

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:43.870
AUDIENCE: These-- the question
that you asked, you asked why--

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:48.490
JULIAN BEINART:
Imagine having a--

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.590
well, first of all,
the formula is wrong.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:57.570
The formula is wrong because it
doesn't deal with circumstances

00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:01.020
which promote continuity.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.530
Cabet bought some land
in France from somebody

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:07.240
who sold him a piece
of land in New Orleans.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:12.690
He didn't know that New
Orleans has a terrible climate

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:15.960
and has animals and
all kinds of things.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.120
He landed with a
bunch of Frenchmen.

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:24.420
How the settlers, first settlers
in America have survived,

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.220
God alone knows.

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:33.010
But Étienne Cabet
then moved to--

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:37.960
Victor Considerant built La
Réunion on his wife's money.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:41.950
He exhausted her fortune and
then the place collapsed.

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:42.700
Poor man.

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:59.160
My question is not, I
suppose, why it failed.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.170
My question is,
what good does it

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:06.420
do to us even if it doesn't
fail or even if it fails, sorry?

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:14.290
Victor Hugo writes
that utopianism

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:20.200
is the truth of tomorrow, that
you need in society people who

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.770
are going to take chances,
propose alternatives

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:25.990
to reality.

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:31.000
Therefore perversion, provided
it does not harm anybody--

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.270
and that's difficult
to ascertain--

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:40.680
should be an allowable
phenomenon, such as I've

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.680
often objected to the
Olympic games not allowing

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:49.450
drugs to be taken by athletes.

00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:53.030
Because drug taking is
a normal human activity.

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:56.180
It depends on the severity
of the drug, of course,

00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:00.220
and obviously as a
model to young people.

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:04.000
But in a marijuana-free
society--

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.730
which is probably not
intoxicating enough

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:08.350
to cause you physical harm--

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:14.730
the stretching of the
boundaries of society

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:19.690
are probably an asset.

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:21.580
Therefore I would stop--

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:24.240
I would not want to live
in a utopian settlement

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.330
myself because the
very impulse that

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:31.225
drove that utopia is frustrated
once you're in the utopia.

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:36.920
You cannot behave differently
in a Shaker community.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.140
You'll be thrown
out the first day.

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:43.680
But if you went and said
to Ann Lee, who herself

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:52.710
was a maniac who suffered
six dead born children

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:56.880
in Manchester, if you'd knocked
on the door in the morning

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.030
and said, "I think we should
have scrambled eggs for lunch

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:08.670
today" and cut it diagonally,
it's just intolerable.

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:12.550
It's, in fact, an antidote
to its own phenomenon.

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:21.330
In order to survive, you
have to be in a decided way.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:25.140
The political dissenters like
William Morris and Kropotkin

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:30.780
and so on wrongly
placed all the blame

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.030
at the phenomenon
of the agglomeration

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:35.310
economies of cities.

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.920
He believed that
you could replace

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:43.620
the success of the economic
and cultural success of cities

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:47.740
now finally celebrated
by the whole world.

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:50.490
You must remember that
it's only in recent times,

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:55.110
that when I studied city
planning for the first time,

00:44:55.110 --> 00:45:00.120
cities were sort of a strange
sort of curious phenomenon

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:04.920
which people some day
may be interested in.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:09.210
The first book in English on
the condition of the third world

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:19.500
city was written here at MIT
as late as 1959, William--

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:23.810
what's-- Man's Search for
Shelter in an Urbanizing World.

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.190
A man who worked in
India decided to--

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:33.510
maybe these are some
important generalizations

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:35.880
about the third
world city as opposed

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.910
to the European American city.

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:43.800
So the phenomenon of urbanism
and its intellectual equipment

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.260
is relatively recent.

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:56.160
And talking about hundreds
years the 150 years ago

00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:01.140
is not to be taken
literally in relation today.

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:04.980
For instance, Morris--

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:06.180
I don't know where it is.

00:46:09.745 --> 00:46:10.245
Yeah.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.060
And the same with Kropotkin.

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:28.350
Kropotkin envisaged, as did the
first [INAUDIBLE] proponents

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:28.950
of the--

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:31.590
Russian, after the
Russian revolution

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:35.640
of the power of electricity
and the electrical grid,

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.550
that this urbanist
movement in Russia,

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:42.990
which we'll deal with
after the spring vacation,

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:45.900
was fundamentally
based on the fact

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:49.110
that you now had a
power grid system which

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:51.930
expanded the
possibility of location

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:54.510
in fundamentally different ways.

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:56.880
Of course, it had
other problems.

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:15.810
I don't know what to--

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:17.980
I'm going to-- let's
talk a little bit

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:20.440
about the architects,
seeing as this

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:24.280
is a class which deals
with architecture as well

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.670
as with society.

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:37.310
Tony Garnier's
industrial city, which

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:43.940
he proposed as a Rome scholar
at the French Academy in Rome,

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:47.990
he tried to get the Rome Prize
for something like eight times.

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:50.120
Finally they gave it to him.

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:54.680
And they asked-- when he
came to Rome, he had to--

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:57.110
he had to study a
Roman town, Tusculum.

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:02.780
He confounded them
all by making drawings

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:05.150
of a new industrial city.

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:07.520
The conservatism of
the French Academy

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.340
wouldn't allow him
to continue the work.

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:13.070
But he did.

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:18.380
When I was a Rome scholar
myself and I arrived in Rome,

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:19.950
I went to a party--

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:23.090
to a reception at
the French Academy

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:28.100
in honor of Tony Garnier, which
is quite an interesting paradox

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:31.955
that they would celebrate the
man 100 years after his life.

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:40.040
Garnier was a superb
draftsman and believed

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.260
in architectural form.

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:47.040
For him what was wrong
with the works in Pullman,

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:52.430
Illinois or in [? Bornsville, ?]
or [? Port ?] [? Lever ?]

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:56.160
and so on, the town was always--

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:57.890
as you will see in the slides--

00:48:57.890 --> 00:49:02.300
divided into a residential
zone where the workers lived

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.010
and the works.

00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:06.860
The works was where the
industrial production

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:08.990
took place.

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:13.670
Tony Garnier embellished--
he did extraordinary drawings

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:14.330
of the works.

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:16.640
The works would be
built of concrete.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:22.610
They would be wonderful, in a
wonderfully built environment.

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:25.790
He said all my buildings
will have round corners.

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:27.350
The concrete will--
they will all

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:31.350
be built of concrete,
which is a new ingredient,

00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:33.800
a new structural ingredient.

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.020
And all the corners
will be rounded off.

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:42.140
Instead of the residential
quarters of Pullman, Illinois

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:44.660
where people couldn't
own their houses,

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:47.210
he made-- and you will
see the illustrations--

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:51.750
he made landscaped
environments for houses.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:54.170
He's got the
interiors which looked

00:49:54.170 --> 00:50:00.080
like Roman
[? castnock ?] compounds.

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.810
What's a Roman house called?

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:04.400
I forget.

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.310
There's a Roman word for that.

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:08.900
It's not mensa, it's--

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:13.040
whatever.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.890
Who speaks Roman?

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:17.395
Latin, anyway.

00:50:17.395 --> 00:50:19.340
What's Latin for a house?

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:21.728
Casa probably.

00:50:21.728 --> 00:50:22.470
Probably casa.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:34.120
Frank Lloyd Wright cites
Henry George quite frequently.

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:39.550
I've mentioned Henry George, his
name in passing in this class.

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:43.970
Indeed, George was an American--

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:46.820
I don't know what--
economist, I suppose.

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:49.430
What would you say
Henry George was?

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:51.080
An economist?

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:55.250
A land economist, who
ultimately believed

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:59.900
that land had no value other
than what people attributed

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:02.420
to it through use,
that land itself

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:05.480
was only useful for agriculture.

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:08.040
Land itself had no value.

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:12.230
It's what human beings did with
it that promoted its value.

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:13.880
And therefore he said--

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:19.250
he concocted the notion that
Henry Stein and Clarence Wright

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:22.640
used in Radburn and
Sunnyside Gardens

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:28.790
is that the increase
in value of land

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:31.220
is the result of
community's action,

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.590
not only individuals' action.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:40.190
And therefore the
agglomeration of value in land

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:44.960
should be assigned and
assigned to the members

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:48.410
of the community,
not to an individual.

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:57.230
In that sense, if you want to
use the contemporary Republican

00:51:57.230 --> 00:52:03.530
Party's definition of socialism,
it's probably socialism.

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:08.260
But Henry George was
hardly a socialist.

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:16.820
Frank Lloyd Wright was
said to have hungry person

00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:20.540
that he would imbibe
anything that came along

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:24.290
and justify it by virtue
of its apparent truth.

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:30.650
Corbusier had a different
kind of philosophy.

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:34.790
I'll show you some
of his early sketches

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:39.020
in which he would almost
make scientific diagrams

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:42.620
of the three human
establishments.

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:46.430
He would diagram which of the
three human establishments are.

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:50.540
He would make a section through
a building showing the sun.

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:56.150
He'd do a vector of the
sun in the day in time.

00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:04.140
In his section, he would
establish the top of a building

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:08.880
has relationships to the
sun and to heliotherapy.

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:13.980
Garnier put-- he's down
in the Southeast of France

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:15.690
up against the hill.

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:18.270
On the top of the hill,
he put the institution

00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:19.800
of heliotherapy.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:23.850
Why the French are so interested
in being healthy because

00:53:23.850 --> 00:53:27.330
of the sun, I don't know.

00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:36.110
But it's a tradition of apparent
human hygiene and human health.

00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:45.590
Corbusier also proposes
the lifting up of the city

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:49.640
off the ground about 15 meters.

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:53.450
This is to create a
landscape of greenery.

00:53:56.140 --> 00:54:03.350
Again, the Europeans always
assume that big moves in cities

00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:05.880
are made by the state.

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:09.530
Somehow for him the city
would be made this way

00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:16.790
by a new state, by a state,
which would exist independent

00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:20.140
of its ideology.

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:25.270
The first Corbusien plan is for
a city of three million people,

00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:27.760
Ville contemporaine.

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:33.130
Here the capitalists occupy
the center of the city

00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:39.750
and the workers drift
out to the outskirts.

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:42.570
This, nobody wants
to build this.

00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:45.420
His second plan,
the Plan Voisin,

00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:49.110
which is a plan for
part of Paris, which

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:53.910
removes the existing
diagonal system of Paris

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:57.780
and replaces it
with a set of teeth,

00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:04.260
dents, those are
orthogonally-shaped

00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:06.750
continuous building environment.

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:14.030
His third plan, when he's
asked by the Russians

00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:18.410
after 1917 to come to
Moscow and do a plan,

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:22.100
is a linear, system of linear--

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:26.270
much like the MARS
Plan for London--

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:30.680
in which he puts
housing in the center.

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:37.850
And that is to appeal
to the new Marxism.

00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:40.700
He's asked by the
mayor of Algiers

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:44.575
to come to make a
plan for Algiers.

00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:51.240
The story of
Corbusier in Algiers

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:56.420
is worth an
afternoon's discussion.

00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:01.530
Corbusier makes a whole set of
plans over a number of years.

00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:05.150
They are called the Obus plans.

00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:09.020
Amongst his most
famous was Obus A,

00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:11.750
which has an elevated
highway system running

00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:15.900
on the coast with
housing underneath it.

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:21.060
This is the first attempt to
build housing in modern times

00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:24.080
under a transportation system.

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:26.750
It turns out to be
very difficult to do.

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:31.910
The amount of noxious material
that automobiles give off

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:35.870
are not certainly something
you want to live underneath.

00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:41.540
However, he makes plans like
that for Rio de Janeiro and Sao

00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:45.800
Paulo, all dream plans.

00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:57.690
So angry with the
response from Algiers--

00:56:57.690 --> 00:57:06.010
by the way, he in his plan
to remove the Quartier de la

00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:08.170
Marine, where the
Battle of Algiers

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:17.410
was fought, the great movie, and
builds those two towers facing

00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:21.490
France, maintaining that
colonial relationship

00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:25.300
between Algiers and France,
which Algerians hate.

00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:32.740
He's so angry that he
writes a letter to Mussolini

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:33.550
to help him.

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:43.050
The French government is at
this time in a pro-Nazi mood,

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:47.080
the Vichy government,
Marshal Pétain.

00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:51.460
They appoint Corbusier as
the director of some kind

00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:53.290
of thing of government.

00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:55.000
He writes to Marshal Pétain.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.810
He says, please help
me tell these Algerians

00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:02.210
that they need to behave.

00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:08.440
So he ends up writing to
the fascists for help.

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:13.810
He goes through from capitalism
to Marxism to fascism

00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:17.000
like playing the
piano to see who--

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.180
who can succumb
to the right note.

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:26.300
For him, the built plan is--

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:28.160
he says it over and over again.

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:33.800
He wrote thousands and
thousands of words in his life

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.630
amongst all these buildings.

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:42.770
Why don't we look at some
of these illustrations?

00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:45.900
What has happened to
the commune movement?

00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:49.010
Would it always exist and
flourish depending on time?

00:58:52.850 --> 00:58:57.620
The larger question is how
propositions about alternatives

00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:05.300
are massaged within society
or are honed within society?

00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:09.500
We have become fascinated
with the word innovation.

00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:13.940
What constitutes
social innovation?

00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:15.515
Same sex marriage laws?

00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:23.260
Certainly, that's an
invasion of a kind.

00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:27.100
Even in Argentina,
it's approved.

00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:28.255
Our great new pope--

00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:33.770
I don't know if this
story is appropriate,

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:37.790
but our great new pope
when he was cardinal

00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:42.890
ran a vigorous campaign
against same sex marriage

00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:47.600
by the wife of the
previous president--

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:50.580
horrific story.

00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:58.430
Anyway, Catholicism is a utopian
venture in a certain sense.

00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:02.990
It prescribes the truth
different from other truths.

01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:06.840
It doesn't abide by
movements in reality,

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:10.650
such as contraception
and limited population

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:11.810
and so on and so on.

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:21.960
So we have powerful utopian
forces in modern society

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.010
who've engaged in great
wealth and great power

01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:32.620
and contradict other
utopian ventures as best

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:34.810
they can in a power game.

01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:37.510
It's too complicated
to make sense of it.

01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:41.650
I want to make sense
of it a bit better

01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:44.110
in the second half of
this class where we deal

01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:46.025
with contemporary urbanism.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.215
Sir Thomas More on the
left, his 200 mile island.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:08.820
It's amazing, the first notion,
described notion of utopia

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:13.200
in the early 16th century
should advocate social equity.

01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:22.250
He was an interesting
man, Sir Thomas More.

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:32.780
Sir Robert Owen, the young
British philanthropist

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:37.290
who after the
experiment in New Lanark

01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:44.790
came to the United States,
the crisis or the change

01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:48.885
from error and misery to
truth and happiness, wow.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.810
Truth and happiness
in the United States

01:01:54.810 --> 01:02:02.440
is living in an enclosed
castle with a gate.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:08.980
These communities would
be dotted on the Midwest

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:11.135
much like Broadacre City.

01:02:11.135 --> 01:02:11.635
Next.

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:18.140
There you can see one
of them on the left.

01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:21.480
On the right is the
best image I could find

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.730
of the decentralist's version.

01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:29.280
The big city is gone.

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.270
Here is in our environment
a non-polluting environment.

01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:40.980
The landscape is vital and
indulges farming and landscape

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.810
for beauty's sake.

01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:44.370
Here's a river.

01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:46.985
There's traditional
methods of power.

01:02:46.985 --> 01:02:49.830
There are new methods of power.

01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:54.030
There's a windmill on the
top, on the hill on the right.

01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:00.930
This is the antidote to London.

01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:04.500
This is William Morris'
version of what the world would

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:10.000
be like if you could substitute
London for it, a bad choice,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:10.540
I believe.

01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:11.040
Next.

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:20.550
Victor Considerant and
Charles Fourier's phalanstere,

01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:24.020
an extraordinary
sensibility that this

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:32.450
is using the same architectural
forms as used in--

01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:34.220
under the auspices of royalty.

01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:40.310
What is it about
behaving differently

01:03:40.310 --> 01:03:44.450
that will succeed if you
put it into a palace?

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:52.750
There's something about
this dream and fear story.

01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:55.630
If I dream too much, I
need to supply myself

01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:59.050
with nourishment, security.

01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:02.200
And maybe architecture
of a certain kind

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:07.775
produces security when
you dream too far.

01:04:07.775 --> 01:04:08.275
Next.

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:17.790
Rue interieure on the left,
pretty modest invention.

01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:21.490
Courtland's wife made
so much fuss about it.

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:26.340
And this on the right
is the interior version

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.850
of the phalanstere
called the familistere

01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:34.415
by Jean [? Godin-- ?] next--

01:04:34.415 --> 01:04:36.595
[INAUDIBLE] Guise in France.

01:04:36.595 --> 01:04:37.095
Next.

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:45.910
And this preoccupation
with the establishment

01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:50.980
of the child's world as
outside of the family, these

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:58.960
are children in Robert
Owen and [INAUDIBLE] being

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:04.790
looked after by not the parents,
but by trained educators.

01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:12.020
There's something about
the next generation

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:19.255
of people being
uncontaminated by the effect

01:05:19.255 --> 01:05:20.500
of the appearance.

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:29.010
The kibbutz movement in Israel
went through great crisis

01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:33.270
around the extremes
of this attention

01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:35.845
to the education of children.

01:05:35.845 --> 01:05:36.345
Next.

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:46.910
The one environment which
maintains the physical form

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:50.340
as an absolute is
the Shaker movement.

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:54.440
This is a Shaker settlement
in Hancock, Massachusetts.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:58.940
On the right are just
indications of the precision

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:01.290
of the environment.

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:05.390
There is no doubt as to
where you hang your hat.

01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:07.700
Everybody will
wear the same hat.

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:10.430
Everybody will wear
the same clothes.

01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:13.810
The broom will hang in the
right position next to a door.

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.890
Next.

01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:31.580
The American scene Humphrey
Noyes and his Oneida community,

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:35.890
also based on some
version of sexuality.

01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:38.780
The Rappites, the
Bethel Rappites,

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:42.300
the great movement
across this country.

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:44.275
The Mormon-- next--

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:52.350
the Mormon spatial
program, they lay out

01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:54.480
one square mile of territory.

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:03.060
Their houses will be
built of stone and brick

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:06.450
according to the
choice of the owner.

01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:12.150
But the layout often alternates
the direction of the plot line

01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:14.760
horizontally or vertically.

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:17.160
There's some theory about
that which I don't quite

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.055
understand myself.

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:23.670
Can you imagine why
it would be better

01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:29.880
to have houses facing
the side of other houses?

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.260
I don't know quite.

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:34.890
I never quite figured this out.

01:07:34.890 --> 01:07:37.680
But then I'm not a great
reader of Mormonism.

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:45.240
The Mormonic communal
activity in California,

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:52.350
here theosophist community
acting out Aeschylus,

01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:55.740
part of the Greeks'
tragedy, a kind

01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:59.440
of freer version of
the Mormon program.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:07:59.940
Next.

01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:09.370
Fountain Grove, how
can I explain this?

01:08:09.370 --> 01:08:10.090
I can't.

01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:12.550
It's just wonderful.

01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:17.920
It's just a drawing for a
developer, the idea of what

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.020
would attract people
if they came to live

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:23.170
in a different environment.

01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:25.630
Unique versus
replicable plans is

01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:29.157
the text underneath
all of the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:37.680
I could live here, I suppose,
if nobody else was there,

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.569
if I had the whole thing.

01:08:41.569 --> 01:08:42.725
I'd have my own religion.

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:48.609
Next please.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:59.600
Another Llano del Rio
intentional community.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:03.709
I think one should look at Drop
City rather than these, Drop

01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:13.380
City, which is somewhere
between the counterculture

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:18.330
of California and cyber
culture of the internet.

01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:20.845
It's perhaps more interesting
to look at than these.

01:09:20.845 --> 01:09:21.345
Next.

01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:32.060
Now the industrial
town, [? Kronenburg, ?]

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:41.550
the Krupp family and
Titus Salt, Titus Salt,

01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:48.920
Saltaire on the
right, distinguishing

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.380
between the works
and the housing

01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:54.170
as two separate components.

01:09:54.170 --> 01:10:01.130
Not making use of the river as
a great amenity on the left.

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:06.420
Titus Salt bought the Crystal
Palace, but it burnt down.

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:06.920
Next.

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:17.110
Port Sunlight by
the Lever brothers

01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:20.980
taking some of the Garden
City ideas of landscaping.

01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:26.020
This looks and feels like
a different kind of world

01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:28.620
than the world of Pullman.

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:29.120
Next.

01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:36.600
And a number of
strange examples,

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:39.570
that happy colony on
the left is by a man

01:10:39.570 --> 01:10:42.540
called Pemberton in
New Zealand in which

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:49.380
the center of the environment
could be farms, model farms.

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:52.800
And there would be four
colleges surrounding them.

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:57.040
God alone knows what the world
of colleges and model farms

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.580
has to do with reality.

01:10:58.580 --> 01:10:59.685
But still.

01:10:59.685 --> 01:11:06.360
Here is another
diversion on the right.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:10.850
I think it's in
Brazil from the 1970s.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:14.100
And it has a model
farm in the center

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:18.270
and then housing just
distributed itself outwards.

01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:22.110
What is interesting
is the variation

01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:26.775
of the circular system from the
pervasive grid shown outside.

01:11:29.730 --> 01:11:32.520
What is it about
a model farm which

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:37.130
centers a good environment?

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:40.800
I suppose it's basically
from an agricultural world.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:41.300
Next.

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:48.370
You see the town of Nahalal
on the left by the architect

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:52.880
Richard Kauffmann, 1924, I
think where, again, there

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:56.380
is a central, a central
impulse to create

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:58.360
a central proposition.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:01.630
And radiating out from
it, it's almost as

01:12:01.630 --> 01:12:03.400
if the center is inviolate.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.290
The center has to be held.

01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:09.760
What's the poem by Yeats?

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.245
"The center holds true."

01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:16.855
Some of you should know poetry.

01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:22.200
Yeats is a great poet.

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:26.000
"The world falls apart, the
center holds, but the--"

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.020
something distributes.

01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:34.460
Anyway, this is almost
primeval preoccupation

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.570
with centeredness.

01:12:35.570 --> 01:12:39.860
We remember [INAUDIBLE],,
this phenomenon

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:46.820
of the center in the pre-modern
or in the archaic environment.

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:51.170
Here is a project by the French
group called [? Commonaut. ?]

01:12:51.170 --> 01:12:57.470
Again, the center is what is
the most valuable preoccupation.

01:12:57.470 --> 01:13:00.560
What happens around the
center just drifts off.

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.700
Now [INAUDIBLE] does the same.

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:03.200
Next.

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.890
This is Tony Garnier.

01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:11.280
Look at the extraordinary
depiction of the works.

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.815
The works is almost more
beautiful than the housing.

01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:24.400
The river is maintained as an
important production source.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:31.360
The ships are managed within
the realm of architecture.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:41.310
The works are all
along the river.

01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:47.580
On the upper left is the
housing, the linear housing.

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:50.190
The hill which is
behind the housing

01:13:50.190 --> 01:13:54.270
has the heliotherapy
center in it.

01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:58.420
And the communal facilities
are in the black on the right.

01:13:58.420 --> 01:13:58.920
Next.

01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:06.530
The heliotherapy
center on the right.

01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:09.680
On the left, the all
communal auditorium,

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:12.740
all shaped according to
a particular concrete

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:13.365
architecture.

01:14:13.365 --> 01:14:13.865
Next.

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:20.130
The house, the housing
environment, this

01:14:20.130 --> 01:14:26.640
is such a far reach
from Lever or Pullman

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:31.440
or Krupp or people of that kind.

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:36.000
This is almost the
interior of a Roman casa.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.220
The workers, this Renault
automobile factory worker's

01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:49.390
wife is seen doing a toilet in
this extraordinary environment.

01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:52.300
Of course, these are dreams.

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:52.800
Next.

01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:02.110
Oak Park, Frank Lloyd
Wright's middle landscape.

01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:06.120
He built 15 houses there
and the Unity Church,

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.460
one of his great buildings.

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:12.450
Here is Broadacres, the
plan of Broadacre City,

01:15:12.450 --> 01:15:17.460
Broadacre City, which is a
very small piece of the built

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:18.820
environment.

01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:24.810
I think its population is
something like 25,000, if that.

01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:29.400
Here the students
[INAUDIBLE] looking

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.870
at the project in Arizona.

01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:32.370
Next.

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:44.100
The plan is a rather
simple plan, the auditorium

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:53.865
and cultural facilities, a
kind of environment which--

01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:03.150
in which the landscape is
a very important feature.

01:16:03.150 --> 01:16:08.640
There are lots of
facilities such as open air

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.040
stalls for selling goods.

01:16:14.190 --> 01:16:18.260
The automobile
population is not fixed,

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:21.870
but everybody who wants an
automobile can have one.

01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:26.100
This peculiar
perspective on the right

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:29.940
indicates some kind of
alternative movement system.

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:36.510
The technology of the
automobile has suddenly changed

01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:38.010
or it looks as to be changed.

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:45.590
Looks as though it's
got telephone dialing

01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:51.560
circular systems on the
automobile and up in the air

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:54.540
some strange piece
of technology.

01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:57.280
Next.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:01.450
Wright [INAUDIBLE] at the
same time was indulging his

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:08.170
fantasies on the left
in a project for--

01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:14.980
I can't remember the date,
probably after the Depression

01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:20.080
years, the new Chicago life
insurance National Life

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:24.730
Insurance Corporation
and this very small town

01:17:24.730 --> 01:17:28.780
in Bartlesville, Oklahoma
for the Price family,

01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:31.960
where as I said in
a previous class,

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:34.600
we have the first
attempt in modern times,

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:38.290
I think, to put offices and
housing on the same floor

01:17:38.290 --> 01:17:38.920
in a building.

01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:44.012
Next.

01:17:44.012 --> 01:17:56.000
Corbusier was so authoritarian
in his ambit of knowledge

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:04.370
that he could depict the
greatest human establishment,

01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:08.870
the Ville [INAUDIBLE],,
the linear city,

01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:15.410
the agricultural
community, the journey

01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:19.530
of the sun for 24 hours.

01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:20.030
Next.

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:26.270
In the drawing on the
section on the left,

01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:30.230
you have some of the key
elements of his building

01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:32.750
and also urbanism.

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:35.750
The high, the sun on
the roof, the roof

01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:39.470
is given to physical culture.

01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:41.330
The center of the
building is given

01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:45.710
to the rue interieure, taken
just really from Fourier,

01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:49.040
but with no sexuality given.

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.180
[INAUDIBLE] the building
itself lifted off

01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:58.100
the ground with vigorous
landscape [INAUDIBLE]..

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:07.450
And this is one of these
great buildings in Algiers,

01:19:07.450 --> 01:19:10.990
the [INAUDIBLE]
building where there

01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:15.460
is a semblance to the
system on the left.

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:15.960
Next.

01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:22.780
The first plan, a plan for
three million inhabitants,

01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:25.420
the center of which
would be the office

01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:31.760
environment for the capitalists,
very primitive ideas

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:34.310
about vehicular transportation.

01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:39.405
But still, it was before the
Merritt Parkway was ever built.

01:19:39.405 --> 01:19:39.905
Next.

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:50.690
The Voisin Plan, just
allocating his nausea

01:19:50.690 --> 01:19:53.600
for the 19th century street.

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:57.080
This is an absolute
renunciation of what

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.750
we call the DNA of Paris.

01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:10.210
[? Langier ?] said of making
a city, make it like a forest.

01:20:10.210 --> 01:20:13.120
There's something intrinsic
in the diagonal through which

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:18.340
our friend [? Hartzband, ?]
of course, understood.

01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:22.630
Corbusier introduces
a new form of housing,

01:20:22.630 --> 01:20:26.620
a new control of the ground.

01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:30.430
Who controls all the
open space that is left?

01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:33.730
These great parks,
who maintains them?

01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:40.540
Is there any question that
this is an imposition which

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:45.840
is tested on any grounds
amongst the people who

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.670
are going live there?

01:20:47.670 --> 01:20:53.480
This is utopian in the sense
that it's a free interpretation

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.460
of an alternative-- next--

01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:58.760
without taste.

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:04.660
He was interested in the
machine and its capacity

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:06.490
for creating linearity.

01:21:06.490 --> 01:21:13.270
This is not Henry Ford's
system of production,

01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:15.400
but a system of communication.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:19.840
On the lower slide on the
left is his proposition

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:24.130
for Rio de Janeiro.

01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:27.710
He made a similar proposition
along with water--

01:21:27.710 --> 01:21:32.230
well, not Sao Paulo
is not on the water.

01:21:32.230 --> 01:21:37.090
Sorry, this is
Buenos Aires I think.

01:21:37.090 --> 01:21:42.990
I can't remember
everything, pretty.

01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:46.680
On the right his work, his work
with the [INAUDIBLE] Group,

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:50.080
connecting all of
Europe linearly.

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:50.580
Next.

01:21:53.810 --> 01:21:57.850
His Algiers proposal,
the Quartier de la Marine

01:21:57.850 --> 01:22:04.690
on the right side is replaced
by two towers facing France.

01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:12.860
The idea of inhabiting
the space under.

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:20.750
What's going to happen to
all of the elevated highways

01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:21.410
in the world?

01:22:30.610 --> 01:22:32.560
Just about done.

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:35.170
OK, next.

01:22:35.170 --> 01:22:37.630
You can also answer the
question after the spring

01:22:37.630 --> 01:22:41.040
break when you've had
time to think about it.
