00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.880
PROFESSOR: Examine every
possible means for combining

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:18.870
the symmetry at once, but
there is a seemingly

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.100
paradoxical trick that
we can yet pull.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.011
And let me indicate what
is true here for 2mm.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.530
OK, so this is a twofold axis.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.060
Has mirror planes perpendicular
to it.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.270
If one of these is a mirror
plane, the other one has to be

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.510
a mirror plane as well.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.700
So there's no way we could make
one a mirror plane and

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.100
one a glide plane.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.290
OK, that requires a net that
is exactly rectangular.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.360
So let's put in the
twofold axis.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.920
And I add one to the
corner of the cell.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.950
As we well know we have to have
twofold axes at all of

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.200
these other locations.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.880
We want to put a mirror
plane in the cell.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.210
We could pass it through the
twofold axis, and that would

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.390
be the same as P getting
to P2mn back again.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.870
But why do we have to put the
mirror plane through the

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.120
twofold axis?

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.690
We have to have the twofold axis
left unchanged when we

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.370
add the mirror plane, because
if we created a new twofold

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.920
axis we create a new lattice
and we'd wreck the lattice

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.060
that we've constructed.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.510
But why, why, oh why couldn't
we put the mirror

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.760
plane in like this?

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.840
That's going to leave the
twofold axis alone.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.700
It's going to leave the
translations invariant.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.950
Why don't we do that?

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.979
Why not?

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.180
So here, trick number five,
or wherever we are now.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.430
You can add the symmetry
elements of a point group to a

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.250
lattice, but not necessarily
at the same point.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.810
You can interweave them.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:36.620
But the constraint is that this
addition must leave the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.870
axis invariant.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.563
Let's leave the twofold
axis invariant.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.310
And vice versa.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.240
That is to say the mirror
planes can't create new

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.220
twofold axes, the twofold
axis can't

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.560
create new mirror planes.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.050
And let's make sure we
understand the reason why.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.230
If I've got a twofold axis here
and a twofold axis here,

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.750
I have to have a translation
that's twice their separation.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.550
If this distance is delta,
then I have to have a

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.160
translation that's
automatically

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.620
created at twice delta.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.230
This is the same as saying
twofold axis with a

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.210
translation gives you a twofold
axis halfway along.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.410
If I take the twofold axis, I
get the translation back as a

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.100
consequence.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.470
So what I'm saying is if we take
the first twofold axis

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.200
and repeat number one to number
two, and then add

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.400
another twofold axis which
repeats number two to number

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.490
three, you have a third one that
is related by translation

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.470
of twice delta.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.990
So if you're going to interweave
the symmetry

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.360
elements, you have to leave the
arrangement of symmetry

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.650
elements at the same intervals,
otherwise you would

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.170
have created a translation or
more that is incommensurate

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.745
and incompatible with
the other ones.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.529
So this is a third trick.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:22.330
And we are going to need
a new theorem.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.510
Let's first of all look
at the possibilities.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:32.660
We can have the twofold
axis interweave

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.910
with a mirror plane.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:44.360
How about putting
a glide plane in

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.290
between the twofold axis.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.720
In other words, replace the
mirror plane by a glide plane.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.880
This twofold axis hangs off
here, reflect it across and

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.630
slide it down to here, and you
get this twofold axis here.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.520
So that's also a self consistent
compatible

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.770
arrangement.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.070
How about a centered net?

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.320
And that's more difficult.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.500
A centered net has twofold axis
and all the places of C2,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.170
and then twofold axes at
locations like one quarter,

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.420
one quarter as well.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.190
We can't put a mirror
plane in here.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.550
That's not going to work,
because it will generate a new

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.060
twofold axis, and that changes
the translation

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.950
T1 to half its value.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.870
We can't even put a glide plane
here because this would

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.650
slide down to here, reflect
across, and that's

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.980
not going to work.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:55.050
So the number of possibilities
is limited, but we'll see that

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.805
there's one other case as well
for a fourfold axis.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.790
OK, we need a new combination
theorem that says if you have

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.910
an operation a, pi, and combine
it with a reflection

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.280
operation that's removed from
it by some distance delta,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.080
what is the result?

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.940
That general theorem has worked
out for you on the

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.860
notes, but I think what I'll do
it in the interest of time

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.930
is simply look at how this
arrangement of symmetry

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.030
elements would move
things around.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.810
And here I've taken the motif
and hung it at the lattice

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.990
point, and repeated it
by the twofold axis.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.280
The mirror plane would take this
and reflected it across

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.530
to here, then take this one and
reflect it across to here.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.150
And do the same thing down at
the bottom of the cell.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:57.650
Let me now ask you what sort of
plane has arisen that would

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.760
be perpendicular to
the mirror plane?

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.620
Could be interweaved or passed
through the twofold axis.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.650
Anybody want to hazard
an answer?

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:10.100
OK.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.890
We have to have some sort of
correspondence theorem that

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.760
says if you've got a twofold
axis, have one plane, you've

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.565
got to have another plane
90 degrees away.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.990
Do I know how everything
is related?

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.990
I know how this is
related to this.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.150
I know this is related
to this.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.330
That's by a reflection plane.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.220
I know how the twofold
axes relate things.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:40.900
How is this pair related
to this pair?

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:48.780
And the answer is that the way
they are related is by rights

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.070
and lefts on here.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.660
This is right, this is right.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.100
Reflection changes handedness
to left, so I've got to have

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.000
some way of getting from this
pair to this pair that

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.910
involves a change
of handedness.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.760
And I see nobody is really
jumping out of their seat, but

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.010
there is a glide
plane in here.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.940
Take this pair, slide it along
by half of T2, and flip it

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.130
across by reflection.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.430
And there is a glide
plane right here.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:22.020
And therefore of necessity
there's a glide plane here.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.320
And this glide combined with the
perpendicular translation

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.480
will put a glide plane
in here as well.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:41.309
And you look in your tables.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:46.670
This is plane group
number seven.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.580
And this one has
a twofold axis.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.840
It has a primitive rectangular
neck, so this is called P2m,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.885
and now the second plane at
right angles is not an mirror

00:09:00.885 --> 00:09:02.290
plane, it's a glide plane.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:09.560
So this is called P2mg, or
there's a shorthand form that

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.540
leaves out the two.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.830
PMG is the shorthand
symbol for it.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:23.100
So there's a new plane group
that is based on orthogonal

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.000
symmetry planes.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.990
One a mirror, one a glide,
and twofold axes.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.820
Let me ask you now what is the
point group of a crystal that

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.790
would have this relation between
the atoms that are

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.650
down in the guts
of the crystal?

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.430
What would be the point
group of the crystal?

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.770
We've got two different
point groups.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.990
We've got point M, we've
got point group two.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.150
What would be the point
group of the crystal?

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:57.080
And this is a new problem,
a new concept.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:04.540
All of the plane groups that we
looked at until this point,

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:09.620
the symmetry elements on an
atomic scale down inside the

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:14.120
plane group were exactly the
same as the point group that

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.180
we had added to the
lattice points.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.520
But here we've got two different
point groups that

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.140
had been put into the lattice.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.910
So do we say that this
crystal has symmetry

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.380
two or symmetry M?

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.950
Or just point group 2m.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.860
That won't work because if you
have one mirror plane in a

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.650
point group, you have
to have another.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:39.785
What this introduces is
a very subtle point.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:50.940
The point group is inherently
a macroscopic symmetry.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.820
When I say a crystal has a
particular point group, what I

00:10:54.820 --> 00:11:04.760
mean is that if I look at the
exterior faces of the crystal,

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.560
I would say there's a
twofold axis here.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:16.310
And that's about all, if these
spaces are pair wise distinct.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.785
I have a crystal that looks
like this externally.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.920
I would say that that crystal
has symmetry 2mm

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.735
based on the faces.

00:11:27.735 --> 00:11:32.310
If I found that the etch pits on
the surfaces were not quite

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.490
the same on this face and this
face, I would have to throw

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:39.000
out the twofold axis, perhaps,
which means this mirror plane

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.400
would go out as well.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.190
But also I would do things
like look at the optical

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.800
properties.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.670
I would measure the
conductivity as

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.320
a function of direction.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:52.000
I would look at the slip systems
and yield stresses in

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.970
different directions, and the
assignment of a point group is

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:03.140
an experimental observation that
requires that you look at

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.640
all possible properties.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:10.090
Not only shape, but properties
like conductivity and the

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:14.400
magnetic susceptibility, and
also perhaps the way the

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.220
crystal diffracts X-Rays.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.700
That's another physical
property.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.340
And then when you've done as
many measurements as you

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:26.700
choose to make, you say as far
as I can tell, all behavior of

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:31.460
this crystal is determined
inconsistent with this

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.860
particular point group.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.980
But you're doing macroscopic
things.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.690
You're doing macroscopic
things.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:42.110
When you talk about the plane
group or space group, you're

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.670
talking what goes on on
a local atomistic

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.770
scale in the unit cell.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.550
So what would be the point
group of this crystal?

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.970
It would have a twofold axis
that would be manifested

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:56.210
externally.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.570
It would have a mirror plane,
which makes the left hand side

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.410
want to be the same as
the right hand side.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:06.020
And if this were not a mirror
plane here, but a glide plane,

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:12.440
what you would say is that this
face, if I reflect it and

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.160
slide it along by one angstrom
is going to become this face.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:22.280
And this face here, if I reflect
it and slide it back

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.020
by one angstrom is going
to become this face.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.860
But what will that do to
the external shape?

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.740
I just extend all these
surfaces, and it's going to be

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.310
exactly what I've drawn here.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.810
How would you distinguish
a mirror plane

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:39.840
from a glide plane?

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.070
If a crystal has a mirror plane,
a face that sits here

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.490
passes through some atoms.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:49.860
Those atoms are repeated
by reflection.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.810
And being slit up by an amount
tau which is on the scale of

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:56.060
atomic dimensions, and
that would give

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.990
rise to a face here.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.700
But can you macroscopically
assign any difference to the

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.150
fact that two faces
atomistically don't meet, but

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.680
are separated by
3.2 angstroms?

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.200
No.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.130
What you see is one face like
this, and one face inclined to

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:16.090
it with a slope that is the same
for either a glide plane

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:17.360
or a mirror plane.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.450
So another truth about
crystals is that

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:34.670
macroscopically a glide line
plane manifests itself as a

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.920
mirror plane.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.480
So paradoxically this crystal,
which only has a twofold axis

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.550
and one mirror plane down in its
guts is going to look as

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:59.830
though it has point group two in
it, even though there is no

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:03.650
sight, atomistically within this
arrangement of atoms that

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:04.900
has symmetry 2mm.

00:15:11.428 --> 00:15:12.390
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:12.740
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.115
Sorry.

00:15:15.115 --> 00:15:16.365
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.230
PROFESSOR: That's a very
good question.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:29.390
And actually, to answer it
properly requires knowing

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:32.880
something about diffraction.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.840
The symmetry of the diffraction
pattern that you

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.520
observed would look as though
it had a mirror plane in it.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:45.270
Which is to say if we put a beam
of white radiation down

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.950
along this direction of a
crystal, imagine these things

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.440
all extending out in a third
dimension, that what we would

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:57.700
see among the arrangement of
spots is a twofold axis in the

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.560
center of [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.150
photograph we'd see a mirror
plane running this way, and a

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:03.510
mirror plane running this way.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:07.455
So we would see spots on the
[INAUDIBLE] pattern, which

00:16:07.455 --> 00:16:08.720
would look like this.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:16.650
So the glide plane would
also behave it

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.020
were a mirrored plane.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.350
And, maybe, if you
think of what

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.470
goes on with the fraction.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.590
If you ask yourself, if I
brought in x-rays this way and

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.700
diffracted them off a layer of
atoms related by this glide

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:36.300
plane, and then I can't do this
actually to the crystal.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:41.190
But, suppose I then inverted the
direction of the incoming

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:48.320
beam, and slitted along
by five angstroms.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.440
Doesn't make any sense.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.830
The diffraction from these
planes is going to look the

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:56.100
same whether I bring in from
one side or the other.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:01.400
So a glide plane, in diffraction
symmetry,

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.140
manifests itself as
a mirror plane.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.569
So how can you determine the
presence of glide planes using

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:08.050
diffraction?

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.020
And you can.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:15.640
And the answer is, that the
glide plane causes the

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:20.249
intensity diffracted it from
planes with certain indices to

00:17:20.249 --> 00:17:21.900
be identically zero.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:26.569
You've probably heard of these
magical extinction rules

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:28.650
they're called.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:35.780
And it says that if h plus k,
plus three times L is two pi

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:39.450
plus four, and the crystal is
green, then you've got such

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.350
and such, the reflection
being absent.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.800
Actually it is--

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.680
I'm getting distracted-- but, it
turns out that glide planes

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.230
affect just a sheet
of reflections

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.930
in reciprocal space.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:58.450
And the reason some reflections
are absent is that

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:02.710
that sheet of reflections
corresponds to what the

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:06.540
projection of the structure
onto that plane would do.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.820
And, if you project a structure
that has a glide

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:14.160
operation onto the plane of the
glide plane, the structure

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.190
looks like the lattice
translation is half as big.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:22.860
And, if that's the case, the
diffraction spots are twice as

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.190
widely separated.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:29.690
And it turns out that all of the
reflections that have an

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:34.280
index corresponding to the
direction of tau are absent if

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.710
that index is odd.

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.220
So, if you knew a little bit
about it to begin with, that

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.690
perhaps answers the question.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.680
So yes, you can determine the
presence of glide planes.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.440
And later on, we'll talk
about screw axes.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.510
You can determine their presence
unambiguously, but

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:53.300
you do that not the symmetry
of the diffraction effects,

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.066
but from systematic absences.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:07.240
OK, another thing I suggested we
could do is to put a glide

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.380
plane in between the
two-fold axes

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.310
instead of a mirror plane.

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:15.480
And this says that I have a pair
of atoms repeated by the

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.730
two-fold axis, the glide plane
would take that pair, shift

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.880
them down by half of the cell,
and reflect them over.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:28.616
So this would be the
pattern of objects.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:36.320
This is not a lattice point,
because if these are right

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.390
handed, that's a right-handed
pair, this is

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:41.890
a left-handed pair.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.870
Now let me try you again.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:48.920
I know how these guys left
and right to this

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.080
glide plane are related.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.440
How about these ones that are
up, to the ones that are down

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.430
here in the middle
of the cell?

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:00.650
There's got to be, from our
correspondence principle, some

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:03.010
plane going in this direction.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:05.593
Anybody want to hazard a
guess at what it is?

00:20:08.431 --> 00:20:11.410
The answer to that question
resoundingly is, no, not at

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.306
this hour the afternoon,
thank you.

00:20:13.306 --> 00:20:14.000
Yeah?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.860
AUDIENCE: Left one.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.910
PROFESSOR: Yeah, very good.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:20.850
Right ones have to go left ones,
and they're going to go

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:24.440
left and right about
these planes here.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.080
And, if I combine this glide
plane with t2, there has to be

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.660
another glide plane in here.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.530
If I combine this glide plane
with t1, there'll have to be

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.650
another glide plane in here.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:42.890
OK, and that turns out to be
plane group number eight,

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:49.106
P2gg, not P2mm, both mirror
planes have become glide.

00:20:57.385 --> 00:20:58.960
All right, we're almost there.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:05.650
If you look at the hexagonal
symmetries, there is just no

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:10.680
way that you can interweave
things, and an attempt is made

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.530
in the notes that
I handed out.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.400
You just cannot do it.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:21.820
But with P4M, P4, there is
one final possibility.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:25.890
And I'll just set that up
and not carry them out.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:45.865
OK, I'm going to put on just P4
with twofold axes in here.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:55.120
Now we have planes that go in
orientations like this.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:01.220
And then there is another plane
45 degrees away that is

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.950
a symmetry independent plane.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:08.210
And the question now, I'll let
you have a crack at it, is

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:13.750
there any way in which I could
take planes in the diagonal

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:17.860
orientation or parallel to the
cell edge and interweave them

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.770
in between the rotation axes
in such a fashion that the

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:24.200
rotation axes were
left invariant?

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.800
Again, conversely if they're
not left invariant, we will

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.630
have created new translations
and wreck the lattice.

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:35.320
So how could we slip in planes,
either reflection or

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.560
glide, and leave the
axes invariant?

00:22:44.298 --> 00:22:48.186
AUDIENCE: One quarter
and three quarters?

00:22:48.186 --> 00:22:49.160
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.916
Do you want parallel
to the cell edge?

00:22:51.916 --> 00:22:52.360
AUDIENCE: Horizontal.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:52.600
PROFESSOR: Horizontal?

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.060
Yeah.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.330
This [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:56.330 --> 00:23:00.540
here has a fourfold axis up,
a fourfold axis down, a

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.510
fourfold axis up.

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:05.960
Twofold axis down, twofold axis
up, twofold axis down.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:11.440
So this would be a lovely
location for a glide plane.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.690
So that's one.

00:23:16.595 --> 00:23:24.890
From the fact that I am placing
the same diagram on

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:29.700
the board yet again suggests
that there's another way.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.070
That's a perfectly good
suggestion, and that's one of

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:34.100
the things we would
have to examine.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.860
Is there any other way I could
put in a mirror plane or a

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:41.730
glide plane and leave
the axes invariant?

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.390
Yeah?

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:46.803
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:46.803 --> 00:23:48.220
45 degrees?

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.470
PROFESSOR: 45 degrees.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:53.140
Through here.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.770
I don't want to do it through
here because the fourfold axes

00:23:55.770 --> 00:24:00.175
sit on the same side, but you
want to put it in like this?

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.205
I don't think you can do that.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:23.560
Glide plane won't work here.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.350
How about a mirror plane?

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:31.300
There's no mirror plane that
goes through these twofold

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:35.630
axes for P4mm.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:38.910
What we had there were mirror
planes here, and then going

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.090
this way were glide planes.

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:42.095
We've already got that.

00:24:42.095 --> 00:24:47.090
How about putting in a mirror
plane like that?

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.510
This goes into this.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.120
Halfway along there would have
to be another mirror plane in

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:52.920
that orientation.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.730
Here's a twofold axis that
demands that there has to be

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:00.410
another one if it has a mirror
plane passing through it.

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:01.660
So there's another way.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:13.350
One final one, and I will not
keep you guessing anymore,

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:17.680
sneaking a peak at the answer.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.000
There is another way you could
do it, and that would be to

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.720
put the glide plane down
diagonally through the cell.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.820
That is put the glide
plane here.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:41.400
That and take this twofold axis,
reflect it across to

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.260
here, and slide it
down to here.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:48.230
So this twofold axis would be
related to this one by glide.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.950
So those three possibilities are
available for point group

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:55.400
4mm and a square net.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:01.500
If you try them, and the simple
way of doing it without

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.330
any general theorem would be
to draw in the way the

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:10.510
symmetry elements repeat the
motifs, and then ask what they

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:13.572
require for the remaining
symmetry elements.

00:26:13.572 --> 00:26:16.680
All of these give the
final result.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.815
So they yield the same result.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:34.540
You can develop a general
theorem for what you obtain if

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:40.750
you have an operation a, alpha
combined with a plane, and

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:44.680
make it a general plan, a glide
plane that is removed

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:50.130
from the axis by some
distance delta.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:54.590
And that theorem is written out
for you in the notes on

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:56.230
the very first page.

00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:00.430
You take a glide plane, and this
is a specific example, a,

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:05.490
pi, if you have a glide plane
that misses a twofold axis by

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:10.480
some distance delta, then the
effect of those two successive

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.060
operations is a glide plane at
90 degrees to the first, and

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.340
it's removed from the twofold
axis by two delta.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:20.980
It has a glide component,
excuse me, has a glide

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.620
component two delta.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.380
So there's a general theorem
for the twofold rotation.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.860
The general theorem for a
fourfold or a threefold

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:33.210
rotation is considerably more
complex to derive, but that's

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:34.920
contained for you in
the notes as well.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.390
All right, we've come to the end
of one other major part of

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:43.490
our story of symmetry.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:49.280
These are the periodic
patterns in a

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.480
two dimensional space.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:28:01.935
And these are then the 17
crystallographic plane groups.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:09.610
Crystallographic is rather
redundant because they are

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.740
groups that have [? in ?]
translation and therefore

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.820
these are the symmetries, the
two dimensional symmetries

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.570
that are suitable
for the atomic

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:17.820
arrangements in crystals.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:27.290
As a little bonus, we also have,
as a result, 17 of the

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:30.100
three dimensional
space groups.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:33.190
Just imagine each of these
plane groups with a

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:39.960
translation perpendicular to the
plane of the plane group,

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.760
and that would leave all the
symmetry elements coincidence.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.210
So you could pick a third
translation at right angles to

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.610
the blackboard of any arbitrary
length, and you

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:51.400
would have a three dimensional
lattice that contain the

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.700
symmetries of a plane group.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:57.140
I think I mentioned earlier that
the way you distinguish a

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.400
plane group with a twofold axis
in it from a space group

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:05.770
with a twofold axis is that
a lowercase letter for the

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:17.300
lattice type implies plane
group, and an uppercase

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:23.110
symbol, capital P stands
for a primitive

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:24.450
lattice in a space group.

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:43.165
So something like lowercase p4mm
is a plane group, capital

00:29:43.165 --> 00:29:50.180
P4mm is a space group with a
third translation of arbitrary

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:52.630
length at right angles
to the plane group.

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:01.770
We talked about plane groups and
space groups, let's take a

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:04.080
giant leap backwards.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.650
How about the one dimensional
space groups?

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:10.910
Bet you were wondering about
them all along and

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:13.870
were afraid to ask.

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:18.090
So what would be the story
for one dimension?

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.470
It's nontrivial.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:32.300
A one dimensional space group
would be a lattice row.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.600
You have just one dimension to
play with, and you can make

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.750
that space periodic
by translation.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:40.210
So there's one lattice type.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.580
Just the lattice row.

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.780
And what sort of symmetries
could you

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.150
place in that lattice?

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:57.220
Now you have to define
your ground rules.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.010
In our two dimensional
symmetries, we did not permit

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:04.890
any operation which would pick
the two dimensional space up

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:11.220
and rotate it and flip it over
and put it down again, because

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.310
that is a transformation that
takes you out of that space

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.790
and pops you back into it.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.230
And we will not in our
discussion of three

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:23.030
dimensional crystallography
consider symmetries operations

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:27.740
that take something, suck it
up into a fourth dimension

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.410
that we can't comprehend, and
then all of a sudden pop it

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.640
down in again, and suddenly
it appears.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.000
I mean, that sounds bizarre.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.960
We wouldn't want to do that.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:39.910
So for plane groups, we did not
allow for any operation,

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:44.380
say a twofold axis that would
flip the object over and turn

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.910
it upside down.

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:47.430
But why not?

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:49.340
I mean this, is mathematics.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.190
If it's your ballgame, you
can make up the rules.

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:56.330
So why couldn't we have a
twofold axis in the plane or

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:57.000
the plane group?

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.330
It would have to leave
the net invariant.

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:01.970
Well actually such entities
do exist, and

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:03.770
they have been derived.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:06.990
They're called the two
sided plane groups.

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:10.710
And if you want to allow that
when you make up the game, you

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:14.150
can actually do that if
you wish to allow it.

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:16.600
And also there could be a mirror
plane in the plane of

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.460
the space that would take the
top side and relate it to the

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.140
bottom side.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.940
So you can do that, you
can permit that.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:27.010
That's a different beast
entirely, but you can allow

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:30.310
that to be one of the
transformations.

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:35.450
So for our one dimensional
space, I would submit to be

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:38.550
consistent with what we've done
and just finished in two

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:39.110
dimensions.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:42.130
And what we will do in three,
we will not allow for any

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:46.020
operation that will take the
space and transform it into a

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:49.100
second or third dimension, and
then put it down again.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.810
So that being the case, the
only operation that is

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:56.310
possible is a mirror point
that would reflect

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.860
things left to right.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.380
And let me illustrate now
with some patterns.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:07.970
There's the lattice point.

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:10.710
So let me put in some motifs.

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:14.810
and I have to make a one
dimensional motif, but to

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:18.230
distinguish the ends I'll take
a little artistic license and

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:21.690
make one end of the motif a
little fatter than the other.

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:24.630
Or alternatively, I could put
a little one dimensional

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:26.250
headlight on this
thing that would

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:27.830
shine just in one direction.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:32.980
So here's a motif hung on every
lattice point, and so

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.940
this is no symmetry at all.

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:39.220
So the symmetry part of the
symbol would be one, and the

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.430
lattice is primitive, and what
do you think people use?

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:46.050
We've used lowercase symbols,
we used uppercase symbols,

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:47.870
what's left?

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:48.320
Yes?

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.840
AUDIENCE: Greek?

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.000
PROFESSOR: Good try.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.250
Gothic.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.510
Actually, what you do is you use
a Gothic symbol with all

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:03.360
these nice little shaded
angular shapes.

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.560
That's a Gothich P, isn't it?

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:07.800
Yeah, that's a Gothic
P. It is.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.179
It actually has thick and
thin parts, curved parts

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:10.650
[INAUDIBLE].

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:11.900
So that's P1.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.500
What about another symmetry?

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:24.760
Well if we have a mirror point
in there, another possibility

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.620
would be to have these
motifs point

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.040
alternately left and right.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.380
So I'll take some non one
dimensional license and say

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:37.970
that there would be mirror
points at these locations.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:46.610
Really nice symmetry, but
actually it would be totally

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:51.489
wasted on these poor denizens
in a one dimensional world.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:53.320
Life would be dull and
uninteresting because they

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:57.300
couldn't see anything except
the motif on either side of

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:01.250
them, because everything is
constrained to one dimension.

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:07.090
There's an old saying about sled
dogs that says if you are

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:12.240
not the lead dog, the scenery
is not very interesting.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.830
And the same is true for these
poor people in a one

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:15.560
dimensional world.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.030
They could never see the
elegance and beauty of that.

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:23.070
But in any case, that would be
Gothic P, no snickers, please,

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:25.960
and that would be m.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.930
And those are the only two
possibilities and a one

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.180
dimensional space.

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:48.180
We have a couple minutes to go,
but I think this is a good

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.530
place to pause.

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:54.650
And I'll give just a brief
indication of coming

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:57.190
attractions.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:00.940
We're now going to look at
point groups in three

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:05.080
dimensions, and a good way of
entering this much more

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:10.640
complex situation is to go back
to something analogous to

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:14.580
what we did for two dimensional
symmetries.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:21.280
And I'm going to first consider
the arrangement of

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:25.990
rotation axes in three
dimensions.

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:29.540
We do not have the constraint
that all the rotation axes be

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:34.060
perpendicular to the plane of a
two dimensional space, being

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.470
therefore more properly
rotation points.

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:39.760
We've got three dimensions we
have to view a rotation axis

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.820
as extending infinitely in a
direction, and there's no

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.770
reason why we can't have another
rotation axis at an

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:46.890
angle to it.

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:47.930
But you know that already.

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:51.260
Everybody's heard about
cubic crystals.

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.920
Even if you think all crystals
are either body centered

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.800
cubic, primitive cubic, face
centered cubic, or complex,

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.540
four kinds of lattices.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.310
But you've heard of cubic
crystals, in the cubic

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:05.940
crystals clearly the rotation
axes are inclined to one

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.310
another and arranged
spacially.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.120
So we're going to ask the
nontrivial question, how can

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:15.820
we combine more than one
rotation axis at a time about

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.560
a common point in space?

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:22.880
And the constraint is going to
be that a rotation about the

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.960
first axis followed by a
rotation about the second

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.410
axis, wherever it is, is going
to have to turn out to be

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:34.610
something that is
crystallographically

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:37.160
compatible with a lattice.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.410
So that's the constraint.

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:42.660
It's not an easy question.

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:47.050
And just to make you feel proud
of yourself when we get

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:52.540
through this, this uses a
geometry that is due to one of

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:57.990
the great mathematicians of
all time, Leonhard Euler.

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:01.630
Probably the most remarkable
thing about Euler was that

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:03.800
he's Swiss.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.860
How many world class scientists
have you heard of

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.290
that come from Switzerland?

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:12.720
Not very many, and the reason is
it's such a small country,

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.760
and if genius occurs as a
certain fraction of the

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.530
population, that's not going
to happen very often in a

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:22.820
country like Lichtenstein
or Switzerland.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.420
Have you ever heard of anybody
prominent in science who came

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.660
from Lichtenstein?

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:28.900
No, probably not.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.160
OK, this then is going to
be a nontrivial piece of

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:36.890
mathematics for us, largely
because it involves spherical

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:38.170
trigonometry.

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:41.200
Which I'm sure if you've ever
heard of, you've forgotten,

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:45.130
and probably don't see
any utility in it.

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:49.440
OK, with that exciting prospect
in hand, I look

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.690
forward to seeing
you on Thursday.
