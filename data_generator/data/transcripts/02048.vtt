WEBVTT

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.010
PROFESSOR: So let's begin to
examine our assumptions having

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.860
to do with the transport
of respiratory droplets

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.700
in a well-mixed room by thinking
about effects of fluid flow

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.310
and transport going
beyond a well-mixed room.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.980
So to begin thinking
about this problem,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.550
it's instructive to think of
examples of simpler flows,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.920
in particular the
canonical problem of flow

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.940
past an object--

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.860
for example, a cylinder.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.270
Here I've shown a cylinder
placed in a uniform flow field

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.830
with increasing speed
and fixed object size.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.850
So as you can see,
at low speeds,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.930
the streamlines are fairly
reversible and simple looking.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.570
And at high speeds, you end
up with very complicated

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.710
turbulent flows.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.220
A very simple parameter
controls the transition

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.190
between these flow regimes,
which is the Reynolds number.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.789
This is a
dimensionless quantity,

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.630
which is a property
of the fluid, which

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.860
includes the kinetic
viscosity, for example, of air.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.840
And I'll just write this,
kinematic viscosity.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.420
And it has a measure
of the flow speed.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.600
So we'll call that U. So the
magnitude of the background

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.110
flow here is U. And it has some
information about the geometry,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.890
in particular the
size of the object.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.400
So for example, we could
define this based on,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.720
well, let's just say, some
length scale L, which could be,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.810
for example, the
radius of the cylinder.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.060
And in the case of this
cylinder that I've shown here,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.090
if the Reynolds number
is less than around 10,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.050
you're in this regime
here of so-called creeping

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.960
flow where you can see
the streamlines are

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.070
very simple looking.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.480
And they are reversible.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.520
So they kind of smoothly
conform to the object.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.000
And you can run the flow
in the backwards direction.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.060
You'll get exactly
the same streamlines.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.350
But once you get to a
Reynolds number of around 10,

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.020
then you start to see
different effects.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.730
And that's because the physical
interpretation of this quantity

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.430
is the ratio of inertia, which
is the tendency for fluid

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.620
to want to keep moving
in the same direction

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.300
due to its mass
that has been set

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.940
into motion,
relative to viscosity

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.900
or to viscous stresses.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.760
And that's the
tendency for the fluid

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.320
to have some
friction with itself.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.660
If you start to move
a piece of the fluid,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.770
other elements of fluid
nearby are pulling back.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.690
There's some friction.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.640
And it impedes the motion.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.690
So whenever inertia is getting
bigger than viscous stress,

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.430
we start to have a
tendency for the fluid

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.260
to want to keep going
in the same direction.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
And it can lead to
very complicated flows.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.640
In particular here, the first
thing that starts to happen

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.200
is the fluid kind of
whizzes past the cylinder

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.710
and then starts to have a
recirculation on the back side.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.140
So this happens around
Reynolds number equals 10.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.880
So if you have Reynolds
number greater than around 10,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.370
you have some
vortices are created.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.240
So it's no longer an
irrotational flow.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.540
It has some obvious
closed streamlines.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.760
If we increase the
Reynolds number further,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.910
like in this situation here, we
get to Reynolds number bigger

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.910
than around 90.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.880
Then those vortices themselves
are starting to spin fast.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.350
And they also have some inertia.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.660
And they start to separate.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.760
Also the fluid is pulling
those vortices away.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.980
So we have vortex shedding.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.630
And that happens in
an unsteady fashion.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.090
So what happens is there's--

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.290
one of these two vortices goes
unstable first and peels away

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.540
and starts to move downstream.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.120
The other one kind
of takes its place.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.580
And it's almost like a
flapping flag kind of motion,

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.990
where a train of
vortices is released.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:23.430
So this is an
unsteady situation.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.290
And this is called
a vortex sheet.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.140
But it's basically
an array of vortices

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.890
that are being released in
a time-dependent fashion.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.890
And at first, that's a
fairly regular process

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.260
when the Reynolds number
is on the order of 100.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.300
But if you keep increasing
the Reynolds number,

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.640
that process becomes
more and more chaotic

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.720
until there's a transition to
turbulence, which is a fully

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.890
chaotic, heavily-mixed flow.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.460
And that happens
through an instability

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.980
around Reynolds
number of a 2,000,

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.909
where you have a turbulent wake.

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:01.520
So behind the object
or the obstacle,

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.250
there is a steady
stream of turbulence

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.750
where, as I've tried
to sketch here,

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.670
you have vortices and
eddies of all sizes.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.340
So there are eddies
like I've shown here

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.470
that are at the scale of
the cylinder, but then much,

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.780
much smaller ones, too.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.330
So it's a very complicated,
time-dependent flow field.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.960
So we can see here,
the Reynolds number

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.940
has a big effect on
the types of flows

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.980
that are generated
and obviously also

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.510
on mixing as you go from
low to high Reynolds number.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.840
So let's think about
how that would change

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.750
in the setting of indoor air.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.360
So let's look at flow.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.590
Let's look at airflow in a room.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.770
So let's think about
the different scenarios

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.360
we could have.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.440
So maybe our first
scenario would be

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.050
we have all the windows closed.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.390
There's no movement in the room.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.880
It's essentially a still room.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.510
But as we've discussed
earlier, there's

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.800
still some air change
with the outside.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.200
So air is still
leaking to the outside.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.330
There's still a little bit
of instability and movement

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.760
also from thermal effects,
which we'll talk about shortly.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.120
So there is a little
bit of flow in the room.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.800
And in particular,
let's just ask ourselves

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.130
what happens if we have a
little bit of air exchange

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.940
with the outside, which is
this flow rate Q that we've

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:32.690
discussed, but in the case
of natural ventilation

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.590
with closed windows.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.240
And in that situation,
we've used as an estimate

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.050
that the air change
time, or air change rate,

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.040
might be on the order of
0.3 air changes per hour,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.740
which corresponds
to 3 hours' time

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.190
to have the room air changed.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.050
So that's a pretty slow pace.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:02.030
If you consider a room
whose height is 2.7 meters,

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.140
just to put a number on it, and
you have that air change rate,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.590
then the average
velocity in the room

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:16.550
is on the order of
1 meter per hour.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.150
So that's a pretty slow pace.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.120
So to go 1 meter, it's going
take a whole hour, so very

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.620
slow.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.620
So you think, not much
interesting is happening.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.290
But if you calculate
the Reynolds number

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.380
for this situation,
the Reynolds number

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.409
is actually 110
with those numbers.

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:36.450
And that's already
putting us in the regime

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.510
of not only forming vortices,
but also having some vortex

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.440
shedding.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.050
So even when a room is
rather still, and there's

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.520
just some very gentle movement
of air out the windows,

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.230
or cracks around the
windows and other places

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.690
where the room may
not be tight, or

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.480
from some other minor
movement going on in the room,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.860
we already expect to see some
unsteady vortices and movement

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.920
of air in that room.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.840
But the situation gets more--

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.990
gets much stronger if we now
move to having ventilation.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:16.460
So let's imagine that we have
an HVAC unit on top-- maybe,

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.470
let's say, an air
conditioner, which

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:22.820
is blowing air into the room
perhaps from somewhere above.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.820
So now we have a flow which
is going into the room.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.400
It still has to leave
somewhere, let's say,

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.110
through an outlet vent.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.909
And in this case, the flow
rate might be a lot higher.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:39.360
So let's imagine, now, we
have lambda a would be,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.840
let's say, 8 air
changes per hour.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.260
And this would be
looking at a typical case

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.700
of mechanical ventilation.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.440
And what we really care
about here, by the way,

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.910
is the total flow rate.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.030
So we're not interested
in just the outdoor air.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.340
So what I really want,
I should mention,

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.520
is lambda bar a, where that
is the total air change.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.250
So lambda a bar, we'll define
as the air change due to just

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.250
the fresh air-- so
that was the Q over V--

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:19.390
plus the air change due
to the filtration flows.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.350
So there is sort of this
recirculating flow--

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.820
and we've written that as Q--

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.510
the outdoor airflow plus
the filtration airflow

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.510
divided by volume.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.240
So I just want to make sure
we throw that in there,

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.610
because you can get some flow
going also by having a HEPA

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.260
filtration unit in your room.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.060
And there's circulation
going on from that.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.320
And that does
contribute to mixing.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.910
And so if we now calculate
what is the Reynolds number,

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:46.520
we're now getting
up to around 2,000.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.550
And that's interesting,
because that is already

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.480
getting to the regime
of turbulent flow.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.430
So just the velocities and flows
that are generated in the air

00:09:55.430 --> 00:10:01.130
from typical air conditioning
or even gentle fans

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.290
will lead to turbulent
flows in the room.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.640
And turbulent flows are
very effective at mixing.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.370
So that's one reason we might
expect to see strong mixing.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.230
So what this actually
looks like is--

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:16.340
imagine there's a
person in the room.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.650
There could be a
table and a chair,

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.770
some kind of
obstacles in the room.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.100
And even if nobody's moving,
just the flow through the room

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.780
is causing some turbulent
wakes and vortex shedding.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.530
And there can be some
circulations, such

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:37.430
that you have some fairly
significant inertial effects

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.310
leading to mixing
in that system.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:45.710
Now, we can also ask ourselves,
what about other ways

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.500
that momentum is imparted
to the fluid in a room

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.730
with people in it?

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.250
Well, it could be, for
example, human movement.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.450
So what if we have--

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:56.910
let's think about
what the Reynolds

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:57.990
numbers might be for that.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.650
So if we have human movement--

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.550
let's say, for example,
I'm moving my arm.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.470
Or I'm moving my head.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.840
I'm not even talking about
running or really moving fast.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.970
But let's just think about
this kind of a motion.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.690
I might be moving
with a velocity

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.990
anywhere from 10
centimeters, or 0.1 meters,

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:16.940
to 1 meters per second, right?

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.740
So I could easily go 10
centimeters in 1 second.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.740
But I could maybe
go a little faster.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.960
And I'm moving a part
of my body, which

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:29.000
might have a length that scales
from, let's say, 10 centimeters

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.730
to 1 meter.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.620
So I'm moving maybe my
arm or my hand or my head.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.960
So if we take this range
of values here and ask,

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.240
now what's the
Reynolds number, then

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:44.230
the Reynolds number is around
10 to the 3 to 10 to the 5.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:45.910
So and you know this.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.280
If you have a room where
there's some smoke or some dust

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.080
particles that you can
see in the sunlight,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.720
just take your hand and move it
like this, even fairly gently.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.540
You're going to see very
complicated turbulent flows

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.680
in the wake of that movement.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.540
So basically, anything
going on in the room

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.930
in terms of movement is leading
to substantial complexity

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.750
in the flow fields, which
contributes to mixing.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:09.050
Another one to think about,
which we will come back to,

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:14.210
is human respiration, so the
fact that you're breathing.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.340
So we will come back to
this term more carefully.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.390
But we can still think about it
in terms of the Reynolds number

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:21.480
right now.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.340
So if you imagine just the flow
that is leaving your mouth--

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.320
so in this case
your length scale

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.480
is on the order of 1 centimeter.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.370
So maybe the area of
your mouth that's open

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.650
is maybe several centimeters.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.080
And the velocity
of your breathing

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.180
depends on how heavily
you're breathing

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.920
and what your activities are.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.340
But it's on the order-- so if I
write this as the velocity U--

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.720
I should have
written this as a U

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.470
as well, from
actually over there.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:51.380
So if my velocity scale
is around 0.5 to 2 meters

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.170
per second--

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:56.310
that's a typical
respiratory velocity--

00:12:56.310 --> 00:13:00.560
then now we find the Reynolds
number is on the order of 10

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.800
to the 3 to 10 to the 4.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:10.500
So again, all these activities
of breathing, motion, anything

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.660
humans are doing in
the room, even just

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.780
sitting there and breathing
is leading to Reynolds numbers

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.540
locally that are on the order of
thousands or tens of thousands,

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.400
which means that we are seeing
turbulent flows in the vicinity

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.210
of those motions.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:25.920
So that doesn't mean
that those flows are

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.410
enough to mix the entire room.

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.600
But certainly in the
vicinity of a person,

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.840
there's a lot of mixing just
from the natural movement

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.580
and respiration of that person.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.730
And when you add into that
the mechanical ventilation,

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.300
there can be very
significant inertial mixing

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.120
going on in the air of a room.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.300
So in this simulation, courtesy
of Saint-Gobain Ceramics

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.810
and Plastics, we see an office
space containing a number

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.220
of workers sitting in cubicles.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.230
And one of them is
an infected person

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.970
emitting infectious aerosols.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.540
And the simulation shows you
how those aerosol particles

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.080
are transmitted through the
room by forced convection, where

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.290
the orange and white
squares represent

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:11.190
ducts of inflow and outflow
in the mechanical ventilation

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.640
system.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.160
This video shows
the effect of motion

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.610
and also respiration
leading to turbulent flows

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.940
by forcing the air to move
at a high Reynolds number.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.760
So in the case of motion,
we see a turbulent wake

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.410
behind the moving person.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.870
And for each breath, we
see a turbulent plume

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:35.370
emitted by the momentum
transferred from the breath.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.670
These images are taken by a
schlieren imaging method that

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.950
looks at differences in
the density of the air

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.760
and visualizes the texture
of the patterns that

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.880
are formed in the density.
