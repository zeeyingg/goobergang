WEBVTT

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.920
PROFESSOR: OK, why don't we
you get started again?

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.040
I can understand why there is
an air of excitement in the

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.910
room since tomorrow's
a holiday.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.230
But we still got two hours
before the day is over.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.695
Any questions on what we have
done up to this point?

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.920
No, that's good.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.470
Let me erase some of this art
work then and ask why one

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.170
would indulge in this rather
bizarre exercise of taking the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.520
elements of something that
represents a physical property

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.450
and constructing a surface
out of them.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.700
Well, the name suggests that
maybe these surfaces, be they

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.170
hyperboloids of one or two
sheets or imaginary

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.280
ellipsoids, have something to
say about the property that

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.270
the tensor that formed the
coefficient of these

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.440
functions is doing.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.480
So let me take the case
of an ellipsoid.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.700
That would be the case
where all the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.230
coefficients are positive.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.310
And let's let this be
x1 and this x2.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.860
And let me ask a
first question.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.920
If this is to be a well deserved
function, does the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.010
surface transform in exactly
the same way

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.650
as the tensor elements?

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.990
In other words, if we take the
tensor in one coordinate

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.430
system and then change the
coordinate system to a

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.740
different coordinate system, are
the coefficients in front

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.810
of x1, x2, and x3 still the
elements of the tensor in that

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.050
new coordinate system?

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.000
So let me show you that this
is, in fact, the case.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.760
Suppose our original relation,
sticking to conductivity, is

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.419
that x sigma ij xi
xj equals 1.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.340
And then for some reason or
another, we change axes.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.010
So the new equation will be some
different coefficients.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.560
Because as we change axes,
they're going to wink on and

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.440
off, still the same surface, but
now referred to different

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.990
axes xi prime and xj prime
still equal to 1.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:36.190
And let me now use the reverse
transformation to put xi prime

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.430
in the terms of xi.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:50.160
If we do that, we can say that
xi prime is cli x sub l prime.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.960
That's the reverse
transformation.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.210
So notice the inverted order
of the direction cosine

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.520
subscripts.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:06.210
And then xj prime is going
to be equal to cmj

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.825
times x sub ep prime.

00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:12.250
To find this, let's just
rearrange these terms in a

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.420
trivial fashion.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:31.640
Then I will have cx sigma ij
cil cmj times xl prime xm

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.600
prime equals 1.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.900
And what is this?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:45.370
This is a summation of direction
cosines where the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.210
first subscript goes with the
subscript on sigma prime.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.550
What did I do wrong?

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.820
This is mj.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.120
Why is that not coming first?

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.620
PROFESSOR: Well, what I would
like to get this in the form

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.830
of is a summation of sigma
ij prime over two dummy

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.246
indices l and m.

00:04:14.246 --> 00:04:15.668
What did I do wrong?

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.450
Ah, yes, right, right, right,
right, this is li.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.730
Thank you somebody said it.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.080
And my nose was right in it.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.160
And I didn't notice it.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.830
OK, this is a summation of all
the original elements sigma ij

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.780
prime times dummy
indices l and m.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.520
And this actually
is sigma ijn.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.730
So it's the same set
of coefficients.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.100
And that is a technicality,
which probably you wouldn't

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.470
want to worry about.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.100
So anyway, the elements of the
tensor transform in the same

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.310
way that the equations for
the surfaces transform.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.210
So if you change coordinate
system, the coefficients that

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.670
you should use should be the
elements that are in the

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.410
transform tensor.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.890
OK, now I'm going to
ask a question.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.280
Suppose I define some direction
by a set of

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.990
direction cosines li and I ask
the value of the radius of the

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.450
surface in that direction.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.810
So this is some radius vector.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:39.940
The radius vector will have
components, R1, R2, R3 or Ri.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:46.350
And each of those components
will be equal to the magnitude

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.330
of R times the direction
cosines li.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.116
Yes, sir?

00:05:52.116 --> 00:05:55.924
AUDIENCE: Could you briefly rego
over what you just stated

00:05:55.924 --> 00:05:57.828
before you erased
it [INAUDIBLE]?

00:05:57.828 --> 00:05:58.780
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.370
I'm sorry.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.070
I said aij xi xj equals
1 is the original

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.020
equation for the quadric.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:14.480
If we change the coordinate
system, we're going to have

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.170
some new elements aij prime
times xi prime xj prime.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.840
Because we've got a new
coordinate system.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.900
And therefore, the coefficients
in front of the

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.330
equation for the quadric
have to change.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:33.350
And now what I did was to
express xi prime and xj prime

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:39.810
in terms of xi and xj using the
reverse transformation.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:49.360
And xi prime in terms of the
original x's will be c sub l

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.930
sub i x sub l prime.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:07:00.320
Usually, we write it xl
equals cil x sub l.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.920
This is the reverse
transformation where the order

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.710
of the subscripts is reversed.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.850
So this will give
me x of i prime.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:16.340
The expression for x sub j prime
will be given by cmj x

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.830
sub j where m is
a dummy index.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.600
And that's equal to 1.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:33.920
And if I just rearrange this,
then I will have cli cmj times

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:43.800
aij prime equals
1 times xl xj.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:55.860
And this is going
to be alx lxm.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:04.370
And this will be alm times xl
xm equals 1, which is the

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.890
equation for the quadric in the

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.470
original coordinate system.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.750
I think that was better when I
was standing in front of it so

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.000
you couldn't see it.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:20.280
It's just that the surface
transforms formally to the

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.020
surface that we would create
if we used the new tensor

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.130
elements for the same change of
coordinates system, which

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.630
you would probably will be
willing to take my word for.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.730
PROFESSOR: This is a direction
cosine for the--

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
right below.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:41.286
PROFESSOR: Right below?

00:08:41.286 --> 00:08:42.536
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.440
PROFESSOR: cli cmj aij prime
xl xm, and then I collected

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.520
the cli cmj times alm.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.710
And that is the transfer.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.146
Yes?

00:09:01.146 --> 00:09:05.130
AUDIENCE: In the previous
[INAUDIBLE], you defined the

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:14.094
derivitave side as being
xi prime equals cil xl.

00:09:14.094 --> 00:09:15.344
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:18.078 --> 00:09:26.325
PROFESSOR: You can say that x
prime is cil times x sub l.

00:09:26.325 --> 00:09:30.480
And if we want to use the same
direction cosine scheme but do

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:38.395
it in reverse, we would say that
x sub l is equal to c--

00:09:51.280 --> 00:10:01.255
yeah, OK, x sub i is cli
times x sub i, right,

00:10:01.255 --> 00:10:02.872
no, times x sub l--

00:10:02.872 --> 00:10:04.423
is that right-- x sub l prime.

00:10:08.106 --> 00:10:13.810
AUDIENCE: On the second line
to the third line, you say

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.034
that xi prime equals
cli [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:21.994 --> 00:10:32.446
It's either xi equals xcli xl
prime or xi prime equals cil.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.160
PROFESSOR: OK, you want to say
this. xi prime and cil becomes

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.050
xl, yes, yeah.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.360
And then mj times x--

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.650
that's x sub m.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:11:07.310
OK, and then this says that cil
cjm times aij prime should

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:11.240
be alm, right, OK, OK.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.615
So it's OK then.

00:11:15.285 --> 00:11:17.980
OK, that was supposed to be a
small point that everybody

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:18.730
would accept.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.730
But now it's done correctly.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.970
OK, let's get back to
this, which is more

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.200
hair raising and exciting.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.870
What is the radius of the
quadric in a given direction

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.690
that we specify by three
direction cosines l1, l2, l3?

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.540
So there's some radius from the
center of the quadric out

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.090
to the surface in that
particular direction specified

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.050
by three direction cosines.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.580
And we know what those three
components are, sub i, are

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.200
going to be in terms of the
direction cosines, magnitude

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.920
of R times li.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:12:02.650
And those points at the terminus
of the radius vector

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.630
go to one point on the surface
of the quadric.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:10.190
So these values of R are
coordinates that satisfy the

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.420
surface of the quadric.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:19.280
So we can say that just
substitute Ri for the

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.260
different values xi in the
equation for the quadric.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:33.270
And this says that sigma ij
magnitude of R times li, that

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:38.220
would correspond to x sub
i times magnitude of

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.740
R times l sub j.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.990
That's the magnitude of xj.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.640
That should be equal to 1.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.150
And if I rearranged this
slightly, this says that the

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:58.690
magnitude of R squared is going
to be equal to 1 over

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:03.040
sigma ij times li lj.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:11.260
So the radius of the quadric
gives me not the value of the

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.790
property in that direction.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.770
This is the value of the
property that will occur in

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:20.610
the direction specified by
the direction cosines lj.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:25.410
The radius of the quadric is
going to be equal to 1 over

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.410
the square root of
the value of the

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.675
property in that direction.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.410
So this is why it's called the
representation quadric.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:45.000
If you construct the surface
from the tensor elements, you

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.060
will have defined a quadratic
form, which has the property

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.850
that, as you go in different
directions look at the

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:56.755
distance out to the surface of
the quadric in that direction,

00:13:56.755 --> 00:14:00.990
that that distance squared is
going to be equal to 1 over

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:05.530
the property in that direction
or, alternatively, the radius

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.520
is going to be 1 over the square
root of the value of

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.570
the property.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.740
There is an enormous
implication here.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:18.390
This says that the value of the
property, if the quadratic

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.920
form is an ellipsoid, the value
of the property as we go

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.170
around in different directions
in the crystal is going to be

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.760
a smooth, uniformly
varying function.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.820
They're going to be no
lobes sticking out.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.250
They're going to be no
dimples, no lumps.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.540
It's going to be an almost
monotonous property, not very

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:37.980
interesting.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.590
It's going to change
in a uniform way.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:44.120
And in fact, we could put the
two surfaces side by side.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:49.710
If this is the value of the
quadric as a function of

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:53.990
direction, if we make a polar
plot of the property as a

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.170
function of direction, it's
going to look sort of like the

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.200
reciprocal of this.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.630
The minimum value of the
property will be in the

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:06.980
direction of the maximum value
of the radius of the quadric.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:11.640
And the maximum value of the
property is going to go in the

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.260
direction of the
minimum value.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.830
So the value of the property as
a function of direction is

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.900
going to be a quasi-ellipsoidal
sort of

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.440
variation but not really
an ellipsoid.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.260
It's going to go as this
inverse square of

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.760
the radii in ellipsoid.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.140
But the thing is it's going to
be something that varies

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:33.690
uniformly between extreme values
of the maximum and

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.160
minimum value of the property.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.260
We are, I assure you, for higher
ranked tensor property

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:45.830
going to look at some absolutely
wild surfaces with

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:50.460
surfaces that do have lobes and
extreme values and very,

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.360
very irregular variation of
properties with directions but

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.195
not for second ranked
tensor properties.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:02.080
There will be a few variations
on this theme, which are also

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.405
interesting to touch upon.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:11.310
In principle, we can get other
quadratic forms from the

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:16.190
tensor if some of the elements
of the tensor are negative.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.450
And in particular, what
would we see--

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.590
and I'll draw this
relative to the

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.470
principal axes of the surface--

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:28.315
what would we see for an
hyperboloid of one sheet?

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:42.670
This is the sort of surface
that might result if one

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:47.130
principal value of the tensor
had a negative value.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.220
Well, this is the quadric.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:54.390
And this is a radius in one
particular direction.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.240
What would this say about
the property?

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.850
Well, let me, to make it clear,
look at one of these

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:05.990
sections through the quadric
that our hyperbola.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:10.150
In directions like this, we
have a radius that is a

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.690
minimum out to the surface.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.119
In other directions,
the radius gets

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.773
progressively larger.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:28.540
And then if we plot the
reciprocal of the square root

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.800
of that, that says that, in
this direction, we get the

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.090
maximum value of the property.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:38.430
And as the direction approaches
the asymptote, the

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:41.050
reciprocal will go down to 0.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.310
But how did I get
two y-axes here?

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.490
OK, so the maximum will
be in the direction

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:50.790
of the minimum radius.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:55.396
And then it will go down
to 0 for the asymptote.

00:17:55.396 --> 00:17:58.790
And that's going to be
symmetrical on either side of

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:00.160
this principle axis.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:09.710
So what then are the radii in
directions outside of the

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.570
asymptotes of this
hyperboloid?

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:16.640
Within this range, the
radius is imaginary.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.320
But if you square it, you
get a negative number.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.490
So within these two lobes,
the value of

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.940
the property is positive.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.730
As you go away from the
asymptotes, you'll get another

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:37.800
lobe like this and another lobe
like this where the value

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.050
of the property is negative.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:43.940
How in the world could
you get anything

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.830
that looked like that?

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.140
Well, a good example of a
property that has this

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:53.054
behavior is thermal expansion.

00:18:53.054 --> 00:18:54.695
And let me give you
two examples.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:02.780
The structure of selenium
and tellurium

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.750
is a hexagonal structure.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:11.910
And there are chain-like
molecules that are pairs of

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:21.360
bonds that rise up around
a threefold screw axis.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.510
So this is two coordinated atoms
in the structure just

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:31.510
spirals up in this triangular
spiral around the threefold

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.760
screw axis.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:41.060
So this is a material in which
the bonding is very, very

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.750
anisotropic.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:46.940
The bonding within these
covalently bonded spirals,

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.610
which are like springs that you
might put on your screen

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.180
door in the summertime, the
bonding is very strong.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.280
Between these individual
molecular chains, the bonding

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.570
is very weak.

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.180
So what happens when you
heat this stuff up?

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.790
It expands like the dickens
in the direction

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.270
of these weak bonds.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:13.630
But the spirals are, in part,
held in this extended form by

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.380
repulsive interactions
in like chains.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:21.670
So when these spirals move apart
as a result of large

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.730
thermal expansion in the plane
normal to the chain, the

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.360
chains relax a little bit.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.460
So you have a large positive
thermal expansion here.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.960
But in one direction along the
normal to the hexagonal in the

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.980
structure, the thermal expansion
is negative.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.940
And that gives you a variation
of property with direction

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.350
that looks exactly like this.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.070
Negative value of the property,
that means the

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.100
structure, contracts
in that direction,

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.980
positive values this way.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.230
The structure expands.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.030
So there's a good
example of this.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.580
There's another example of a
material, which, again, has a

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.250
negative thermal expansion
in one direction.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:18.030
And this is calcium carbonate,
which is a complicated

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.910
hexagonal structure.

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:23.480
But it looks very, very much
like the structure of rock

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.490
salt in a distorted form.

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.094
These are the calcium atoms.

00:21:30.094 --> 00:21:36.120
And calcite is CaCL3 And
the calciums are in a

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.050
face-centered cubic
arrangement just

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.320
like in rock salt.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:46.710
The carbonate groups are very
tightly bonded little

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.190
triangles with the carbon
in the middle.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:54.730
And these things are arranged
on the edges of the cell.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.950
And this is going to
be very schematic.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:07.090
These triangles are
normal to the body

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:08.190
diagonal of the cells.

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.100
So you have one family of
triangles that are all

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.560
parallel to one another.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.430
On the next edge, the triangles
are anti-parallel to

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:17.590
this first orientation.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.770
So think of rock salt.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.810
Tip it up on its
body diagonal.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:24.270
Every place you have a chlorine
anion, place a

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.570
triangle in an orientation that
is perpendicular to the

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:32.830
body's diagonal of the
rock salt structure.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:36.900
Again, these tightly bonded
little triangles don't do much

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.580
as you increase temperature.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.910
But the bonding between the
calcium and the triangles is

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:43.000
rather weak.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.280
So again, you find that the
structure expands in one

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.810
direction so strongly that
it contracts to the other

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.235
direction so calcium
carbonate.

00:22:54.235 --> 00:22:57.670
The calcite form also has the
distinction of having a

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.420
negative thermal expansion
coefficient.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.920
We'll talk quite a bit about
expansion coefficients as one

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.050
example of a tensor property.

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.600
Interestingly, and we'll say
more about this and I'll give

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:15.220
you some references when we come
to this point, can you

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:19.410
get a material that has a
negative thermal expansion

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.146
coefficient in all directions?

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:28.620
No, that seems as though it
would violate in a flagrant

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:32.220
way some vast law of
thermodynamics that things

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:36.410
have to increase their volume
when you increase temperature.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:41.810
There were, however, a few odd
ball materials that over a

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:47.310
very, very limited temperature
range would contract but only

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.290
by a tiny amount in
all directions.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:53.020
And then one of the very
interesting discoveries of

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:58.910
recent years done primarily by
a crystal chemist named Art

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:02.970
Slate, who's out at the
University of Oregon, he

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:06.780
discovered a family of materials
that have large

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:10.150
negative expansion coefficients
in all directions

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:11.580
over a considerable range of

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.910
temperatures, like 100 degrees.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:15.870
So these are materials, when
you heat them up, they

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:19.710
contract amazing
as that seems.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.320
And there's a structural
reason for it.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.920
These are tetrahedral frameworks
in which one corner

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.860
of a tetrahedron is dangling.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:33.710
And as you heat it up, this
tetrahedral corner can get

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:39.110
closer to other tetrahedra,
which takes energy to do.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:43.570
But in so doing, you actually
are changing the net volume

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:47.090
occupied by the solid
so very, very

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.170
anomalous set of compounds.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:50.390
More of these have been found.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:53.830
There are probably a dozen
materials now that have

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:55.750
negative thermal expansion
coefficients in all

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:56.250
directions.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:02.060
So is the imaginary ellipsoid
a viable representation

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:06.240
quadric for real materials?

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.105
Yes, in the case of thermal
expansion coefficients.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:18.150
OK, so the representation
quadric then is a dandy device

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:21.940
for seeing with one function
how a property

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.530
will vary with direction.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:31.040
For an ellipsodial quadric, the
variation of the property

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.230
itself with direction is not
really ellipsodial but

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.120
quasi-ellipsodial in that
there's a small principal

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.270
axis, a large principal axis.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:44.350
And the large value of the
property goes with the short

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.600
axis of the quadric.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:54.860
So we have a nice device for
representing the value of the

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.935
property as a function
of direction.

00:25:57.935 --> 00:26:00.560
It looks as though we've lost
all information about the

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.850
direction of the resulting
vector, the generalized

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.370
displacement.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:12.180
It looks as though that's
not in here at all.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:17.650
Well, there was an ad years
ago for a bottle spaghetti

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:23.160
sauce, which offends many cooks
who are very fiercely

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.030
proud of their own
spaghetti sauce.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:29.280
So here's a wife who's using
the canned stuff.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:34.170
And her husband comes home and
looks at it very, very

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:37.925
skeptically and says,
where's the basil?

00:26:37.925 --> 00:26:40.140
And the housewife says,
it's in there.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.950
It's in there.

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.730
And he sniffs again and says,
where is the basil?

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.820
And she says finally,
it's in there.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:47.330
It's in there.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.180
Well, this is a similar
situation.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.390
Where is the direction of
the generalized force?

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.820
And I say, it's in there.

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:55.990
It's in there.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:58.890
Not obvious, but
it's in there.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:02.310
So let me now show you
where it is lurking.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:07.295
I think we have time to
carry this through.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:17.260
Let me describe how it's
embodied in the quadric and

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.990
then prove to you that this
is indeed the case.

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:26.930
And I'll use a general quadric
in the form of an ellipsoid.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.140
That looks more like an
egg than an ellipsoid.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.735
It has a pointed end.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.670
OK, this is something
that's called the

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:45.985
radius normal property.

00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:01.370
And what it says, in words, is
that, if you pick a particular

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:08.240
direction relative to the
quadric, we know that its

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.990
length is going to be inversely
proportional to the

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:13.350
square root of the value
of the property.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:17.420
If you want to know what the
direction of the resulting

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.840
vector is, for example, in our
relation for conductivity now

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:28.230
getting very warm, it says the
current flow is given by a

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.790
linear combination of
every component of

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.250
the electric field.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:35.020
The radius normal properties is
that, if you want to know

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:40.060
where J is for this particular
direction, look at the point

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:44.040
where the radius vector
intersects the surface of the

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:49.190
quadric and, at that point,
construct a perpendicular to

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.700
the surface, which, in general,
will not be parallel

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:57.950
to R. And this will be the
direction of J. It won't give

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:58.770
you the magnitude.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.210
But it'll give you the
direction of it.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:27.380
OK, let me now prove to you
that the quadric does have

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.630
this property.

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:41.360
In our conductivity relation,
the direction of J is going to

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.960
be given by the tensor
relation.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:51.200
Namely that J sub i is equal
to sigma ij times E sub j,

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:57.950
which can be written as sigma ij
times the direction cosines

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:04.590
of E sub j times the
magnitude of E.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:09.310
I'm going to want to compare
this expression, with which

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:13.910
you're very familiar term by
term, with the normal to the

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:17.350
surface that we can
compute from its

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:20.740
derivative at that point.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:26.980
So this will say that J1 is
equal to sigma 1, 1 l1 times

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:34.390
the magnitude of E plus sigma
1, 2 times l2 times the

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:39.795
magnitude of E plus sigma 1, 3
times l3 times the magnitude

00:30:39.795 --> 00:30:42.910
of E. And I don't need
to write much more.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:50.640
J2 will be sigma 2, 1 times l1
magnitude of E plus sigma 2, 2

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.772
l2 times the magnitude
of E and so on.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:03.020
What is going to be the normal
to the surface as a function

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.270
of direction?

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:14.740
OK, to do this I'm going to
say that the normal to the

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:22.760
surface is going to be, if I
have some function of xyz, the

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.330
normal to that function
is the gradient.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:34.570
Let me say that that's
G of xyz.

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:41.360
And we can say then that the x1
component of the normal is

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:45.290
not going to be equal to but
proportional to the gradient

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:48.790
of the equation for the quadric
with respect to x1,

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:51.650
dx2, and dx3.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:55.080
So it's going to be proportional
to the

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.340
differential of the function
that gives us the surface with

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:03.810
respect to x1 times i plus the
differential of the function

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:15.370
with respect to x2 times
j plus dF dx3 times k.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.730
So this is the normal
entirely.

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:24.030
So if we split this into
components, N1 is going to be

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:27.660
equal to dF dx1.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.800
And if I differentiate the
equation for the quadric,

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:36.630
that's going to be 2 sigma
1, 1 times x1.

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:44.950
Remember the equation for the
quadrant is sigma 1, 1 times

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:49.080
x1 squared plus sigma
1, 2 times x1 x2.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.610
So if I differentiate--
let me write it down.

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:04.910
If I take those terms and
differentiate with respect to

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:09.010
x1, I'm going to get 2
sigma 1, 1 times x1.

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:13.910
Here I'll get sigma
1, 2 times x2.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:18.540
But then down in this line where
I have a sigma 2, 1 x2

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:21.960
x1, if I differentiate with
respect to x1, I'll have

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.200
another term sigma 2, 1.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.540
And if I differentiate with
respect to x3, I'll have sigma

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:34.850
1, 3 plus sigma 3, 1 times x3.

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:39.060
And a similar thing for the x2
component of the normal,

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.240
that's going to be proportional
to the gradient

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.150
with respect to x2.

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:47.650
And that's going to be equal to
sigma 1, 2 plus sigma 2, 1

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:58.920
times x1 plus 2 sigma 2, 2 times
x2 plus sigma 2, 3 plus

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:04.610
sigma 3, 2 times x3 and
similarly for N3.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:11.840
OK, I've made my case if I
can demonstrate that each

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:18.310
component of J, J sub i, is
proportional to each component

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:21.190
of the gradient to the function

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:23.989
that defines the quadric.

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:30.700
If you look at them, they're
close but no cigar.

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.230
The first term is OK.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:36.219
I've got a 2 out in front of
sigma 1, 1 for the x1 term.

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:49.010
Here, though, I have the sum
of two off-diagonal terms.

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:55.590
And for this expression,
I have just sigma 1, 2.

00:34:55.590 --> 00:35:00.700
And down here I've just the
single term sigma 2, 1.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:07.230
So the conclusion we're forced
to draw is that these two

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:10.460
expressions would have
components of a vector that

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:15.200
are parallel to one another
if sigma 1, 2 was

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.490
equal to sigma 2, 1.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:21.660
Because if these were equal,
I could write just

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.940
twice sigma 1, 2.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:28.200
And down here I could write
twice sigma 2, 1 and do that

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.380
all the way through these
two expressions.

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:33.060
And then this factor of 2 would
just be part of the

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.900
proportionality constant.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:46.210
So the radius normal property
will be true or valid only for

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:47.460
symmetric tensors.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:58.400
That is it's going to be true
only if sigma ij is

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.570
equal to sigma ji.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:03.900
We mentioned when we first
started talking about second

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:09.980
ranked tensors that a tensor
does not have to be symmetric.

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:15.070
And showing that the tensor is
symmetric has nothing to do

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:16.250
with symmetry.

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:19.550
Because it's symmetric in an
algebraic sense not in the

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:23.770
literal sense of geometrical
symmetry.

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:28.770
And there are some properties,
the thermal electricity tensor

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:32.450
is one notable example, where
the tensor is a second ranked

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:37.360
tensor but it decidedly
is not symmetric.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:53.445
So this is OK for most
properties but not all.

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:13.820
OK, so here are properties of
the representation surface

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:21.380
that we can construct from the
representation quadric.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:29.230
And what I would like to do
following this and after the

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:34.340
inevitable unpleasantness of
a quiz is to look at some

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:37.500
specific properties that
illustrate second ranked

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.460
tensor properties.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:45.500
And in particular, I would like
to look at some other

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:49.040
sorts of second ranked tensor
properties that represent

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.120
generalized forces, namely
stress and strain.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.760
You've seen these before in
other contexts perhaps not

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:00.570
actually defined rigorously
in terms of tensors.

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:04.580
Because, obviously, stress and
strain can be regarded as

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:05.740
generalized forces.

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.810
A stress is something that
you can apply to a solid.

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:11.840
And that will cause various
things to happen.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:16.280
In addition to mechanical
behavior, different properties

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.910
and effects can result.

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:21.850
So that is going to involve a
generalized force, which is a

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:23.410
second ranked tensor.

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:26.050
And a thing that might happen
could be a vector.

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:28.420
It could be another second
ranked tensor.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:32.040
And this is going to introduce
us to the nasty world of

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.640
higher ranked tensor properties
and their

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.830
representation surfaces.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:41.180
So this is a nice place to quit
and pause for a quiz.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:46.390
When we resume, we'll look at
stress and strain in terms of

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.640
our tensor algebra.
