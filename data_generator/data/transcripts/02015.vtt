WEBVTT

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.770
PROFESSOR: So now
that we've talked

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.990
about the different dynamics
of droplets in the air,

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.600
we can think about how
different types of pathogen

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.700
can leverage those
droplets to transmit

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.130
from one person to another
through respiration

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.270
through the air.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.290
So let's begin with bacteria.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.470
So there are many different
kinds of bacteria.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.920
The typical size of
a single bacterium

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.290
is on the order of
several microns.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.320
So let's just say,
1 to 10 microns.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.820
On the other hand,
bacteria can also

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.310
exist in colonies or
larger structures.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.350
And that does determine,
to some extent,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.430
what kinds of droplets can
transmit those bacteria.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.960
So let's begin with an
example of a large-drop

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.580
bacteria, which
is typically going

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.140
to be found in large drops.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.430
And that would be
the bacteria that

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.039
causes strep throat,
the streptococcus.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.070
So the streptococcus
bacteria, which is shown here,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.670
has a typical size that's
around two microns.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.530
So it's on the smaller end.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.830
And it forms chains and
even larger colonies they

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.820
may have different structures.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.340
And the total size
of the colonies

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.160
can vary to be as big
as even 500 microns.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.250
So it may not be always
that big, but it might be,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.990
let's say, 50 to 500
micron sort of colonies.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.720
And they can often be these
sort of stringy type structures.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.009
As a result, those require
fairly large droplets.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.440
Now just simply knowing
that we have large droplet,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.270
tells us a lot about how this
bacteria can actually transmit

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.610
and what measures must
be taken against it.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.850
Because as soon as we have
large drops, then what it means

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.620
is that we have fast settling.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.639
So we know drops that
are in this size range

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.850
are going to fall to the
ground within a few seconds.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.070
And even if you cough them
with a lot of big velocity --

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.120
which is something we'll
talk about later in this

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.500
and these lectures --

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.350
then still, in
only a few seconds

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.310
those droplets can sediment
out and they really

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.930
don't go very far.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.950
OK?

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.480
And so they're fast-settling.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.940
And so what that
means is that we have

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.110
either fomite transmission,

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.510
where those droplets
settle on the ground,

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.810
or on some other surface --

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.680
somebody touches that
surface, touches their eyes --

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.230
and so that's one
method of transmission.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.530
We could also have direct
airborne transmission.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.650
Where let's say, I
cough or breathe on you.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.890
And the droplets end up in
your face and maybe directly

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:58.640
on your eyes,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.290
or maybe you breathe them in --

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.420
so there could be also
direct airborne transmission

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.430
for some of the
smaller sized droplets

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.460
or for large droplets which are
ejected from let's, say a cough

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.790
or something.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.750
And so what that means,
that the way that we protect

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.450
against bacterial
transmission of disease

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.910
is, for example,
for the fomites,

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.360
we will disinfect surfaces.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.990
We can wash hands, of course.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.360
And we will avoid
touching eyes or nose.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.630
So those are pretty
basic measures.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.050
At the same time,
if we're worried

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.130
about the direct
transmission of the droplets

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.820
from especially coughing or
sneezing larger droplets,

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.320
then what else can we do?

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.740
Well, we can have
plastic shields.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.260
Either worn over
the face or maybe

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.200
a barrier between yourself and
some other person that you're

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.830
interacting with to avoid that
sort of projectile transmission

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.420
of large droplets.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.220
And also, we will get
the six-foot rule.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.120
Which is just an example of
a social distancing measure,

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.520
which is recommended
to avoid this sort

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.000
of direct airborne transmission.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.700
Again, coming back to the
idea that droplets of the size

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.740
typically settle
in a few seconds.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.230
And if you look at the typical
velocities of ejection,

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.240
especially from
coughs and sneezes,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.720
then they will settle in about
six feet or so or about two

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.560
meters.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.940
Although that's not a hard rule.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.380
The six-foot rule happens to be
for the United States Centers

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.350
for Disease Control, the CDC.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.530
But there's also [the]
one-meter rule, which

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.350
is basically a three-foot
rule, for the World Health

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.010
Organization.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.310
So this is not
extremely well defined,

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.480
what should be the distance.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.090
But clearly, if you are able
to stay away from people,

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.870
then even if they're
coughing or breathing

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.950
these large droplets with only
a few seconds of settling time,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.780
those droplets
will hit the floor.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.120
And it will not be able
to infect you directly.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.500
And so it's
important to maintain

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.340
that kind of distancing.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.710
OK.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.500
Now there are also other
kinds of bacteria that don't

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.910
form these larger colonies.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.450
And they remain small even
when they're transmitting.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.250
And a classic
example of that which

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.050
can be transmitted in small
drops is tuberculosis.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.100
In fact, the original
study in the 1930s --

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.950
also involving wells -- was for --

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.170
that led to this --

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.080
essentially the distancing
rules and the six-foot rule

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.950
in particular -- had to do
with coughing and sneezing

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.070
and the distance over which
droplets could be transmitted

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.720
containing tuberculosis.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.600
Now tuberculosis
on the other hand,

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.480
as you can see in
the image, is a sort

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.570
of rod like bacteria
that's quite small.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.040
So the length is several
microns, typically two to four.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.980
But the radius is half a micron
or even down to 0.2 microns.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.980
So actually, we're really
talking about hundreds

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.900
of nanometers in length.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.020
So these are kind of
little rods like this.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.900
And they can be contained
in a pretty small droplet.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.100
These big colonies of course,
require something much larger.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.240
So these droplets
could be small.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.960
And so there is a
possibility here

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.860
of larger aerosol transmission.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.810
By larger, I mean in the
range of 5 to 10 microns.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.610
So of course
tuberculosis also can

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.150
be contained in much
larger droplets, which,

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.340
you know, fall to the ground
as we've just been describing,

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.840
but tuberculosis
is a bit different

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.150
in that these individual
bacteria could

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.990
be transmitted airborne in
larger aerosol droplets.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.570
And in fact, that
is what is found.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.510
If you have this
size of droplet,

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.660
then it turns out, for
example, if my radius is

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.000
let's say greater
than 4 microns,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.800
then the settling
velocity you can

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:17.600
find given the density of
aqueous fluids, is around 2 --

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.890
bigger than 2
millimeters a second.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.910
And then the time to drop
from a typical person's height

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.940
to the ground is
around 15 minutes.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.490
So these are not
the kind of aerosols

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.250
that might stick
around for hours

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.400
like the sub-micron
aerosols that are also

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.110
produced by breathing
and which are too

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.570
small to contain tuberculosis.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.810
But still, these times
suggests that tuberculosis

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.440
can linger in the air.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:56.170
And in fact, long distance
airborne transmission

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.480
is not only possible
as we've just

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.190
argued based on physical
grounds, but it's

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.400
been directly verified.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.110
That's been done both
in humans studies

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.970
and also in animal studies.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.370
Where they can have two
different compartments with

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.330
a sick animal, such as a ferret
or some other animal model,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.600
and the disease is
spread to another animal

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.480
who's had no direct contact
but is sharing the same air.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.550
So the airborne
transmission is definitely

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.960
verified in this case.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.340
And now you might
ask, well, what

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.290
are the preventive measures?

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.390
So instead of all
of these measures,

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.159
like plastic shields
and six-foot rule,

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.909
if you're actually
airborne transmission --

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.610
if there is a
shield, then the air

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.929
is going to go right
around the shield.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:40.970
And it's going to go
everywhere else in the room,

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.070
because the air is flowing.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.740
In the same way that when
you light a candle and you

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.410
see where the smoke
is going, it quickly

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:48.660
spreads around the whole room.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.170
It doesn't care if
there's a shield there.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.010
As long as there is a
way around the shield,

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.490
that's going to find that.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.010
And so instead,
when you're trying

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.470
to protect against
airborne transmission,

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:02.450
your protective measures
are things like ventilation,

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.430
so bring in fresh
air from outside

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.020
or opening your windows;

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:10.970
air filtration, where
you're passing the air

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.860
through a filter which
is going to filter out

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.610
the particles by size or by
charge or some other mechanism

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.600
like that;

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.100
and also it becomes
more and more

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.440
important to wear face masks

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.660
because then at least you
can block these droplets

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.330
at the source and
also at the target,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.340
as we shall discuss
in much more detail.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.700
So what we see here
is just knowing simply

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.760
the size of the pathogen
and understanding

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.850
the physics of
droplets in the air,

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.470
helps us to understand
the modes of transmission,

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.990
which are written here in blue.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.630
