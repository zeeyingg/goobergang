00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.280
PROFESSOR: So let's think
of a specific virus,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.670
the coronavirus, including
the case of interest today,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.920
which is the SARS-CoV-2
novel coronavirus.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.210
So this virus comes
in the form of virion,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.390
which is the capsid
containing RNA, which

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.940
is then going to infect a cell.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.700
And the size of that virion is
around 120 nanometer diameter,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.980
and it's nearly
a perfect sphere.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.320
Now, the size here of 120
nanometers compared to bacteria

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:55.550
is about 1,000 times
smaller than [some] bacteria.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.720
So this actually has
a very big implication

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.790
in terms of how a virion can
be spread from one organism

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.370
to another.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.890
So the bacteria,
if you recall, are

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.480
the size of several microns.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.690
That's the scale of large
droplets, which sediment --

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.250
or larger than that,
they would begin

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.700
to sediment out of the air.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.600
And we can think about
transmission through coughing.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.510
Also, besides the fact that
the virus is much smaller,

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.380
it cannot swim.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.060
So bacteria have various
means of locomotion -- cilia,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.380
flagella, et cetera, whereas
the virion essentially

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.060
is a little hard sphere.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.430
So how can a virion
actually transmit itself?

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.789
Well, if we draw
a droplet, which

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.250
is released by
respiration, then the virus

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.780
is actually extremely small, at
the scale of typical droplets

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.509
that come from respiration,
which, as we've discussed,

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.770
have a typical, most
probable size around half

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.740
a micron, and then
have mostly droplets

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.610
that are larger than that.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.440
So at that scale, if we think of
this as a micron scale droplet,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.470
this little virus
is extremely small.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.270
It's like a little
point, essentially.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.230
And so a single droplet may
contain a couple viruses,

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.860
a couple virions.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.060
And so in order for the
virion to escape the droplet

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.930
and make connection
with a cell in a host,

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.670
let's say it's been breathed
in, and in the lungs,

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.340
it's going to try to
meet with some cell

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.900
and begin to infect it.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.040
Or conversely, if the virion
is being shed and released

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.440
from an infected
cell and then needs

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.200
to go into a droplet to
then be exhaled and spread

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.170
to somebody else,
either way, the virion

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.220
has to get in and
out of this droplet.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.240
And since it cannot swim,
the only way can do it is

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.780
by essentially a random
walk or a diffusion process,

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.360
where it's just bouncing around
due to thermal fluctuations.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.040
And eventually, at some
point, it gets out.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.640
So the diffusion process -- we
can estimate the typical time

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.140
to escape.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.650
I'll write it this way --

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.730
[it] can be shown if the
radius of the droplet

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.710
is R, the average
time for a randomly

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.680
distributed and selected virion
anywhere in this droplet,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.280
the time for it to escape is
of order R squared over D,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.260
where D if the diffusivity.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.350
And if you do a precise
calculation for a sphere,

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.030
then there's a
factor of 15 here.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:52.470
And so that is basically average
escape time by diffusion.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.680
So that gives you a sense
of how quickly the virion is

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.390
able to get out of the cell --

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.060
or out of the
droplet, excuse me.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.000
Now, how big is the diffusivity?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.680
Well, the diffusivity
of the virus,

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.810
if you think of it just
as a fluctuating sphere

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.899
in a viscous medium, then we can
use the Stokes-Einstein formula

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:25.940
for the diffusivity,
which is k_B*T,

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.950
where k is Boltzmann constant
and T is the temperature.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.100
So k*T is the thermal
energy of the fluctuations.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.940
And that's divided by 6*pi
times the radius of the virus,

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.950
and then the viscosity
of the liquid or fluid

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.480
containing the droplet.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.340
So essentially, this
denominator here

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.580
is the Stokes drag coefficient
for a sphere fluctuating

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.650
in a viscous medium.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.030
So that's the diffusivity.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.470
And if you figure out for the
size of 120 nanometers, if we

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.040
use the viscosity of water, if
we assume the droplets are just

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.280
water, then this is
3.6e-8 centimeters

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.270
squared per second
in water, where

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.920
we use the viscosity of water.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.500
But the droplets
are not just water.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.610
In fact, they cannot be.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.460
As we've already discussed,
water droplets at this size

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.120
range would very quickly
evaporate and disappear,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.400
or they would leave
the virus essentially,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.990
a virion no longer
contained in such a droplet.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.150
So what's more typical is
that the droplet in fact

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.670
contains many
macromolecules and is

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:46.280
coming from mucus in the
pharynx, in the vocal cords,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.680
coming from the lungs directly.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.590
And mucus has a much
higher viscosity.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.260
So notice, here, we
have the viscosity

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.790
of the liquid coming in.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.710
And if we take into
account the fact

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:03.260
that the viscosity of mucus
relative to the viscosity

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.220
of water is roughly --

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.890
it depends where the
samples are taken

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.180
and also what's the shear rate.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.770
So we're talking
about low shear rate.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.120
These are sort of moving slowly.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.100
The viscosity of
mucus is dependent

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.060
how quickly you're shearing it.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.240
But if it's a low shear rate,
then this is on the order of

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.340
1e3 to 1e5 at low shear rates.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.330
And because the viscosity
has that factor,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.730
the diffusivity is then
divided by that factor.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.030
So what that's telling us is
instead of being around

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.730
1e-8 centimeters
squared per second,

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.670
we're really looking at
more like 1e-11

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.430
1e-13 centimeters

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.190
squared per second in mucus.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.400
So we assume these are
actually mucus droplets, which

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.500
are not fully evaporating and
are contained in aerosol form,

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.390
then this is the
kind of diffusivity.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.310
And if we plug into
this formula here,

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.990
we can get a sense of what is
the average time for the virion

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.740
to actually escape.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:32.680
So why don't we make a
little table of that result.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.050
So let's look at the radius.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.880
First, let's consider here 0.5
microns, or 500 nanometers.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.180
So that would be a
1-micron diameter droplet.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.090
So that would be kind of a
typical aerosol droplet coming

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.320
from breathing.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.500
Let's also consider
larger droplets.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.980
So let's look at
5 microns, which

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.740
is kind of on the upper
end of the aerosol range.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.159
And then we could
look at 50 microns.

00:07:59.159 --> 00:08:01.740
And I should say this
is R of the drop.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.530
So the R here, just to be
careful, is they R of the drop,

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:09.330
as opposed to the R of
the virus, which is R_v

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:17.270
is half d, so that's
60 nanometers.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.670
OK, so that's the diameter.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.800
So this is the different
size of the drops.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.870
And just for comparison, let's
look at water versus mucus.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.680
And from mucus,
why don't we take

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:35.520
that the viscosity of the
mucus is 1e4 times

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.169
the viscosity of water?

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.480
So we just pick something kind
of in the middle of this range.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.000
OK, well, if we plug
in then the numbers

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.530
and we try to plot the average
escape time that I've just

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:51.250
written here, R^2/(15*D),
then in water,

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.820
this turns out to be
about 5 milliseconds

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.290
for an aerosol droplet.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.960
So we know the aerosol droplets
are evaporating quickly

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.850
and also that a
virus can diffuse out

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.280
of it relatively quickly,
because the water is not

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.510
really that this.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.820
Now, if we move
in this direction,

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.400
we're multiplying R by 10.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.230
And notice, the time scale
goes like R^2.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.350
So there is a pretty
strong size dependence.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.380
So as we think of a 10
times larger droplet,

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.610
it's 100 times longer time.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:25.750
So that would be 500
milliseconds, or 0.5 seconds.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.610
And if we go another
factor of 10,

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.410
that's another factor
of 100 in time.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.410
And if we convert
seconds to minutes,

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.960
it turns out to be
around 8 minutes

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.150
for a fairly large drop.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.010
Now, what if we're in a mucus?

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.500
So now, we go in this direction.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:46.940
The timescale goes like 1/D, and
D goes like 1 over viscosity.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.590
So the timescale is
proportional to viscosity.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.390
So we're getting this
factor of 1e4.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:55.800
That's a pretty big factor.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.290
And so, for example, this
5 milliseconds for mucus

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.390
can turn into 1 minute.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.550
So from an aerosol
droplet, which

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:08.200
is sort of at the most probable
size from respiration, which

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.300
is on the order of a
little bit below 1 micron,

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.170
a typical virion would
take about a minute

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:18.910
to diffuse out of that droplet
and infect a nearby cell

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.900
or tissue.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.010
Now, if we look at a little bit
bigger droplets, this 1 minute,

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.170
we multiply by 100,
it's 100 minutes, which

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:30.150
is on the order of 1.5 hours.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.180
And what if we keep going
another factor of 100?

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:37.110
That turns into around 7 days.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.220
So if the virion is contained
in one of the larger droplets

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.350
that comes from
coughing or sneezing,

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.850
it could take it hours to days
to escape from that droplet

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.760
and have any chance of
infecting a host cell.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.150
So you can immediately see
the problem for a virus

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.880
in terms of transmitting
is it can't swim.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.560
It's extremely small.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.320
And so it's not a good
way to transmit itself

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.740
to be sitting in a large
droplet or a pool of liquid,

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.770
imagine a pool of
saliva or some phlegm

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.600
that you've just
coughed up, which

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.970
is very common for
bacterial transmission.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.790
For a virus, it's
much more difficult

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.520
for a significant amount of
virus to actually get out.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.070
So if the virus is going
to transmit itself,

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.440
it makes a lot more sense
to be in aerosol droplets.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:28.480
And so it's really here,
the aerosol droplets

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:35.970
are the most infectious,
because basically,

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:37.060
the virus able to get out.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.190
And based on this
calculation, roughly speaking,

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:45.790
if R of the droplet, which
we're just calling R,

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.850
if R is less than
around 5 microns,

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.590
those are the ones
we would expect

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.900
to be the most infectious.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.760
And interestingly
for SARS-CoV-2,

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.540
recent experiments have sampled
droplets from sick patients

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.570
with COVID-19 at
different sizes.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.390
And it was found that
the droplets that

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:09.160
had a diameter less
than about 4 microns

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.260
were the most infectious
and clearly you

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.880
could see replication
of the viral RNA

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.430
in samples of those
droplets, whereas larger

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.740
droplets in this
range here, kind

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.660
of larger than a few microns,
were less infectious.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.420
And in fact, the virus was
less able to replicate.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.570
So it's kind of consistent
with this physical argument.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:36.350
So basically what we
would probably say

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:44.150
is that in this range, the
virions are mostly trapped.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.570
They have a hard time
getting out of those droplets

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:53.180
and can deactivate over time,
because that's also happening.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.730
They are believed to have
a certain finite lifetime.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.570
And so this is the
case that the virions

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:06.670
are trapped and deactivate in
large drops or the fomites,

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.030
which are infectious residues
on surfaces that are left over

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.860
from those droplets.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.840
So this really shows
us that our focus

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.480
should be on looking
at aerosol droplets

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.200
for viral transmission.
