PROFESSOR: In Chapter 3, we will
study epidemiological models,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.720
which describe the
spread of an infection

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.150
and then the recovery from
that infection in a population.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.140
And the traditional
epidemiological models

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.920
that we will study
for populations,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.090
and also adapt to
indoor spaces, involve

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.940
keeping track of compartments
or subgroups of populations,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.290
such as the number of
susceptible people,

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.990
the number of infected,
exposed, and recovered.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.690
So for example,
an infected person

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.170
can expose a
susceptible, and then

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.320
the exposed person can
themselves become infected,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.150
or they may eventually recover.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.840
And there are various rates
for these different processes.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.890
And this leads to a set
of nonlinear differential

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.700
equations that describe the
evolution and growth, and then

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.620
ultimately decay,
of an epidemic.
