00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.350
JULIAN BEINART: This class
has been taught continuously

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.940
since 19--

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.890
the earliest record
I have of it is

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:38.510
1956, when Kevin Lynch probably
taught it for the first time.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.650
Now this is the 34th year in
which I'm teaching the class.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.550
I overlapped with
Lynch for two years,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.540
and this is the last time
I'm teaching this class.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.590
So I'm going to go through a
lot of small things, details,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.860
plus some general idea about.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.830
In 1956, Kevin Lynch
called this class

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.100
The Visual Form of the City.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.500
Between '56 and '76,
he changed the title

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.320
to Theory of City Form.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:28.060
I have kept the title the same
as it was originally, well,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.530
the 1976 title.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.410
I think the "theory,"
it gives the impression

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.140
that we have
significant theories,

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.620
as in post-Darwinian science.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.290
We don't.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.570
Our basis, our theological
basis is somewhat vague.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.930
We are somewhere between
a science and an art.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.690
In the Media Lab, they now have
a group called City Science.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.920
I want to know what
City Science is.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.170
We certainly know
what City Art is.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.539
If numerical consequence is
the basis of City Science,

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.150
we will deal with that in
the appropriate manner.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.110
We will also deal with
very difficult things,

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.520
such as the human
experience of built form,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.820
which is not a scientific
phenomenon at all.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.500
In fact, for those
of you interested

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.250
to have a background
in philosophy,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.670
there's a new book
called Cosmos and Mind,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.790
by Thomas Nagel, who's
a professor at New York

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.030
University, who argues that
Darwinian science has lead us

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.670
in the wrong direction,
that Darwinian science,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.910
we can't explain concepts
such as consciousness or mind,

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.470
that we need a new teleological
approach to science

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.200
which would embrace these now
difficult to achieve responses.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.580
I'm not a philosopher
nor a historian.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.860
This is not a class in
history, although we

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.640
will use a lot of
information from the past

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:20.470
as examples to give us a
better idea of the present,

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.260
not that you shouldn't
know history.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.800
If you're going to
take this class,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.670
I would recommend
a couple of books.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.595
There is no superb
urban history.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.060
If there were, Harvard
or MIT would teach it.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.600
It is bizarre that these
two great universities

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.845
don't teach urban history.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.660
It's difficult to explain.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.810
Partly, it's explained
by the traditions

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.500
of history and architecture.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.670
Architecture, you cannot study
in the arts without knowing

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.810
history.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.960
It's difficult to
achieve a degree in music

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.280
without knowing who Mozart
was, but it's very difficult

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.950
to achieve a good
degree in architecture

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.830
without knowing
who Palladio was.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.260
But you can achieve
a degree in science

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.080
without knowing
who Copernicus was.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.710
It's difficult to
avoid Copernicus,

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.170
but you may be able to.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.290
There's no teaching
here at MIT in--

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.750
there's no required teaching,
in achieving an engineering

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.990
or science degree, in
the history of science.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.560
There's no architecture
program that I know anywhere

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.100
in the world that doesn't
have a requirement that you

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.500
study the history
of architecture,

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.890
some poorly taught, of course.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.060
I assume many of you are
architects by background.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.420
Has anybody done urban history?

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.570
Has anybody in this class
taken a formal subject

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.780
in urban history?

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.720
OK, if you have, answer
the following question.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.000
What theory would you assume
for the genesis of cities?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.610
Why do cities exist?

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.620
AUDIENCE: We studied
Chinese urban history.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.960
JULIAN BEINART: Oh, no, no.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.430
You haven't answered
my question.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.160
You've told me what
you've studied.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.820
All right, we'll return
to this question.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.470
Because we'll talk about
the conflicting theories

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.390
about the genesis of cities.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.380
When did cities first
occur, time-wise?

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.350
AUDIENCE: As in the poor city?

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:53.020
JULIAN BEINART: I asked
you, give me a time, a date.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.570
AUDIENCE: About 5,000 ago, AD.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.140
JULIAN BEINART:
Yeah, I would now

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:07.320
claim Jericho to be the oldest
city, probably about 10,000 BC.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.470
But if you say it's
[? South Alleyouk ?]

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:16.350
or someplace else,
paleontology is very vague.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:23.110
Most of our understanding of
cities comes from archaeology.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.930
There's no theory which
explains the origin of language.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.325
There are multiple theories.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:40.860
Cities occur very late in
the humanoid evolution.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:47.160
The first tool is dated
at 2.6 million years

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.155
ago in the Olduvai Gorge in
Kenya, found by Louis Leakey.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.870
So if cities date
from 10,000 years BC,

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.420
we have an anomalous period of
time from four million years

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.310
before Christ to 10,000 BC.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.150
During that period of time,
a great deal of paleontology

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.640
has been--

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.060
one of the transformations
of the humanoid

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:27.210
to the human erectus
deals with nutrition.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:38.550
Until you have a tool which
can make food possible other

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:44.790
than vegetables, you'll
have the capacity

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.250
to take in
nutritional substances

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.270
into the body, which
theoretically include

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.160
the creation of a larger brain.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.960
So the brain size
of Australopithecus,

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:07.790
which is about four million
years old, a post-ape animal,

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:11.210
has a brain of about
400 cubic centimeters.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.890
You have brains of about 1,200
to 1,400 cubic centimeters,

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.560
depending how big you are
and how smart you are.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.440
I don't think smartness has any
connection to size of brain.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.710
But I'm throwing in just
one other thought here

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.690
around the idea of the genesis.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:35.450
I'll go into this more
carefully with you on Thursday.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.240
There's a British
paleontologist-psychologist

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:46.670
called Robin Dunbar who studied
the increase in human brain

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:52.100
size and argues that human
brains increased more

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:57.590
significantly in
communities of 150 people

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:02.000
than when people
stayed on their own

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.420
or didn't partake in
rituals of 150 people.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.830
This theory is called
the gossip theory

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:16.570
and argues that people
and children need

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:22.330
to be indoctrinated into the
rules of this settlement,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.440
and it takes about 150
people to make sure

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.380
that these rules are
properly disseminated.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.940
How this was done, nobody knows.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.410
If you believe Chomsky's
theory of language acquisition,

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:48.280
you'll believe that human
beings have an innate capacity

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.650
for language, and
at a certain point,

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:54.070
almost like the strike
of a piece of lightning,

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.640
it was activated
in the human brain.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:00.880
There are many,
many other theories.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.850
I'm not a linguist
nor a philosopher,

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:13.420
but I'm just trying to explain
to you in a very primitive way

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:19.720
how the advent of cities is
late, how the advent of cities

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.930
is difficult to explain.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:26.680
I will deal on Thursday with
two contrasting theories,

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:32.590
the theory of surplus, and the
theory of cosmic knowledge.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.010
Let me go through some
of the practical things

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.400
that you need to know.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.900
You're going to be
overwhelmed with reading.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.190
You have to develop a mature
understanding of what to read

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.170
and what not to read.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.510
I'm giving you an exercise.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:06.890
The required reading is about
1,500 pages for the semester.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.670
That's about four
books, four books

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.700
for graduate student
learning about cities,

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.010
the form of cities,
is not very much.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.030
By the way, one of the
reasons for the increase

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:26.740
for the size of the reading
list is the enormous expansion

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.860
of material in this field.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:38.830
I have in front of me the 1956
references from Kevin Lynch.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:43.060
He totals 50 books, 51 books.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:51.070
My expanded reading
list is 500 books.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.065
Let me give you an example.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:16.420
in 1964-- that's eight years
after Kevin Lynch started

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.530
teaching this class--

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.340
the first book that dealt
with third world cities,

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.980
or developing country
cities appeared.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:28.750
1964, MIT published Man's
Struggle for Shelter

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:33.640
in an Urbanizing World, a book
by Charlie Abrams, still one

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.570
of the best books published.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.750
Can you imagine
that the literature

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:46.090
on what now constitutes
the majority of the world

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:55.520
was not available in
English until 1964?

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.270
When I first started
teaching this class,

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.270
students wanted to
do papers on cities

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:05.180
where they came from, Nairobi.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.730
There's no urban
geography on Nairobi.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.300
Now there's an urban
geography on almost every city

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.150
that exists in the world.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.765
When we did a studio
in Chandigarh 19--

00:13:17.765 --> 00:13:19.643
god only knows when--

00:13:19.643 --> 00:13:26.330
in the 1980's, I
think, you couldn't

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:27.840
get a plan of Chandigarh.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.070
It was prohibited by
the Indian government

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.090
for security reasons.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.950
The only one that you could
buy was through Russian sources

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:40.610
via Houston for $2,000.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.520
So we did this study
of Chandigarh, which we

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.280
had to make our own base map.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.610
Today, that would be ridiculous.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:54.140
So if this class
has a bit of a lag,

00:13:54.140 --> 00:14:00.080
it was built at a time
when there were few books,

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.710
and material on
cities was scarce.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:11.170
I'm not here to teach for
history or for posterity.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:17.780
I'm here to teach you as human
beings in the best way I can.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:21.790
But I will talk, I
will cover the material

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:26.540
as best I can in about
40 to 45 minutes,

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.350
then I will show
illustrated material

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:34.420
in almost all the classes
for about 15 to 20 minutes.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.210
And then there will be
a period of 10 minutes

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.420
for general observation.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.920
If we cannot, as in the case
of case studies like Paris

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.460
and London, finish with--

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:54.640
there may be no time for asking
questions or deliberating

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.440
on the subject.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:01.810
We may start the next class with
me asking your questions about,

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:06.280
what questions you have
about what I presented,

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:11.045
such as, why is Paris
twice as dense as London?

00:15:11.045 --> 00:15:11.545
Why?

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:24.340
Both developed significantly
from 1750 onwards.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:29.980
Why did London develop
less densely than Paris?

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.654
You should know these things.

00:15:31.654 --> 00:15:34.320
AUDIENCE: The wall?

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.830
JULIAN BEINART: You're
right in some ways.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:44.280
The wall, the last wall of the
five Parisian walls was built

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:49.770
as late as the 1820's.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:54.780
London, there's a rule you
can, if you don't know European

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.420
history, and you don't
know European cities--

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.540
and some of you who come
from the Orient may not--

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.970
the fortification of
cities is more extreme

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.870
as you go eastwards
from England.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:14.130
The wall of London was a pretty
miserable wall, a little bit

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:17.700
of it left in the gates,
like Ludgate and so on,

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.860
but basically, it
wasn't very much.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:30.480
Vienna's walls were never
penetrated except in 1683

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.900
by the Ottoman Empire.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.100
You don't need to know
all of these details,

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.110
but you have to understand
the conceptual structure.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:44.250
Why would you build a city?

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:51.110
One of my favorite quotations
is from Marx talking

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.870
about the origin of cities.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:17:00.590
He says "the antagonism
between town and country

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:04.280
begins with the
transition from barbarism

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:09.920
to civilization, from tribe to
state, from locality to nation,

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.220
and runs through the whole
history of civilization

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.170
to the present day."

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.290
The first antagonism
he talks about

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:21.319
is between town and country.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:23.810
Cities were always
clearly demarcated

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.180
between town and country.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.770
It took until
renaissance for nature

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:37.460
to be introduced in the walls,
within the womb of the city.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:46.730
The Romans used to say, I
think, [LATIN],, they are lions.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:54.530
The world outside the walls
was a world of treachery

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.095
and difficulty and fantasy.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.260
There are many
ideas about cities

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.040
which are complex as that
idea, but the antagonism

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.040
between country and
city still lasts today.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.830
President Obama was elected
because of the majority

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.610
that he had in cities.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:22.570
The Democratic Party
is an urban party,

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:27.010
by and large, although this
has changed significantly

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.460
as the size of
cities has changed,

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:35.260
and as the demarcation of
polling districts has changed.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:42.130
But we'll talk about this
distinction between country

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.400
and city, and in
the third class,

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.020
we'll deal with
the organic model.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.000
But you could see
somebody like Marx,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.580
who really tried
to do everything,

00:18:54.580 --> 00:19:01.090
and was right about 50% and
wrong about 50%, judgment

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.655
about the significance
of the advent of cities.

00:19:08.353 --> 00:19:13.010
We know relatively little
about these things,

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:21.630
and I tend to prefer histories
which deal with examples.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.130
So Morris's book The
History of Urban Form,

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.770
or Braudel's book on
the Mediterranean,

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:33.530
or on the structure of
everyday life are better than--

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.230
although Lewis Mumford,
The Culture of Cities,

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.800
is still the standard.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.385
He's wrong on many things,
but he's full of ideas.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.870
It's a Mumfordism to claim--

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.050
anyway, forget about Mumford.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.820
We'll talk about
him sufficiently.

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:11.780
Let's see in these
generalized notes.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.610
By the way, there
are other reasons

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:24.900
why Paris is more
dense than London.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.310
There's not one simple reason.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.000
What kind of houses
did Englishmen live in?

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:45.670
As opposed to what
kind of houses did,

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:49.622
during the time of Haussmann,
did the French live in?

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.950
We'll go into some of those.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:04.580
Look, I'm not a historian, and
this is not a class in history.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:09.590
It's a class in deriving
ideas from a number of sources

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:12.440
and arguing them with you.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:17.030
I have no, other
than a lot of time

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.910
spent teaching and
preparing for this class,

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:24.410
and a lot of external
experience practicing in cities

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:30.650
all over the world, I have no
golden formula for the truth.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:32.870
I don't claim to have that.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:36.140
I'm not sure that I believe
anybody who says they do.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:47.210
I'm not a theist, and I'll
come across quite often

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.380
as an agnostic, if not
an atheist, with regard

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.495
to truths of religion.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:05.220
Jerusalem has only been the
capital of a city, of a country

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.540
twice, once during the
period of the 10th century,

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:14.220
during the crusader
occupation, and after 1948

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.400
with the advent of Israel.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:23.430
Jerusalem, which we will do in
great detail in one case study,

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:30.540
is subject to an enormous
number of philosophical

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.810
interpretations of history.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.360
There is no single
truth about Jerusalem

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:42.600
that is outside the truth of
geopolitics at the moment.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.690
This is true for much of--

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.420
so if I, to use
the term "theory,"

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.180
which Kevin Lynch started--

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.690
I will use the term--

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:02.860
I would have not called this
class Theory of City Form.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:07.780
We live in a predominantly
scientific age, in which theory

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:16.630
is theory in physics, and it's
about as precise as it can be.

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:20.320
Theory in the social
sciences is much looser,

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:25.040
in theory in city form
is even looser than that.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.580
So I would have
called it, this class,

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:31.270
really, more preoccupied
with normative ideas,

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:35.950
normative and functional ideas
about the former cities, rather

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:37.660
than theory.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.330
If I taught this
class in Paris, I

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:44.530
would be deriving
theory from theory.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:48.340
This class follows
the Chicago style,

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.250
and I only will
discuss a theory if I

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:55.870
can attribute an example
in association with it.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:05.130
So I will be making propositions
and choosing an example

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:07.200
to adumbrate that proposition.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:12.540
The example will come from
architecture very much.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:16.800
Amongst the social
sciences or disciplines

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.370
other than urbanism, if there is
such a thing as the discipline

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:27.000
of urbanism, much of my material
will come from the built world.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.900
It's a bias, which I accept,
and it's the only one

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.545
that I know a little bit about.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:44.200
So for instance, if I want to
talk about the problem of how

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:49.540
you deal with the future
expansion of a city,

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:55.600
I will look at the plans of
university buildings designed

00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:03.970
in competition from
1955 and 1960 to 1990,

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:10.720
where an attempt to design for
a system which could accept

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.990
change is much easier to see.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.990
I'll also refer to
a thesis done here

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:21.670
on MIT, which looks at
the way MIT has been

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:26.830
able to expand using the
same trajectory of expansion,

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.120
formal expansion.

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:31.270
What else?

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:41.210
As for the definition
of a city, I'm

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:48.485
going to use any definition
that you wish to bring forward.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:56.480
Cities are, by and large,
denser than non-cities.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.420
And that's about
all you can say.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:03.470
The SMSA definition
of a metropolitan area

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.950
is useful for
statistical purposes,

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:11.360
but god alone knows
what Mexico City,

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.330
what are the boundaries
of Mexico City?

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.850
There's more investment
outside of the city

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:20.300
of Mexico City in
the metropolitan area

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.920
than there is in
the city itself.

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:33.220
Is Foxborough, where the
Patriots play football

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:37.595
every Sunday during the winter,
part of the metropolitan area

00:26:37.595 --> 00:26:38.095
of Boston?

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.500
The city of Boston had nothing
to do with the decision

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:48.220
to locate it in Foxborough.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.780
As cities have
expanded horizontally,

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.800
so the issue of what the
boundary of a city is

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:58.930
becomes more complex
and more interesting.

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:02.800
There are more new prototypes
of urbanism created

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.060
by the expansion, or horizontal
expansions, and more anger

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.750
by architects who believe
that cities should still be

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:14.710
framed as if they were walled.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:19.450
Both of these arguments
are pretty viable,

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:22.480
and will be worth
discussing them.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.510
OK, I'm going on and on and on.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:30.940
Any questions about procedure?

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.210
You're all very silent.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:36.895
Has anything I've
said been wrong?

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:42.720
That's amazing.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.820
You're much too gullible.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:54.920
Look, I will, at
times, say things

00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:00.680
which I feel more strongly
than I feel about other things.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.560
That's my privilege,
because I teach this class.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:07.950
If you taught the class, you
would have that privilege.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:11.870
You are absolutely free to
question everything I say.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:21.650
Let me just say something,
which I hope you'll remember.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:25.490
In one of the evaluations
of this class, which

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:31.250
is done every year, there was
a question from the students

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:35.750
as to why they didn't
ask more questions.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.510
And one of the number of
answers here, the professor

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:39.590
knows too much.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:45.710
My response is, would you prefer
to be taught by a professor who

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:49.080
knows too little?

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.555
That's a stupid response.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:59.130
Please just don't feel because I
have had 34 years of experience

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:02.430
teaching this class, that
you should understand it

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.670
all without question.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:11.190
I feel free to diverge
and choose opportunities

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:15.330
to say things which come
to me for the first time.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:18.900
That's the way I think.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.210
I would like you to
think in the same way,

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:26.412
even if you might get
irritated by my presumption.

00:29:26.412 --> 00:29:32.070
There is no single theory
of city form that exists.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:35.700
There is no absolute theory.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:40.320
There are many theories, and
there are preferred theories,

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.650
as opposed to silly theories.

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:45.135
There are many, many problems.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:54.570
Robin Dunbar's theory of 150
people has been taken up,

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:58.620
and firms, corporate firms,
have divided their manpower

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:04.680
into groups of 150 people
based on Dunbar's studies.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.040
We're not going to do
something as silly as that.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:15.390
Reading, there's two pieces
by Kevin Lynch generated

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:20.310
in this class
through discussion.

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:25.440
And I think they ask questions
which are interesting,

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.250
and answers which
are interesting.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:33.780
The first three classes,
starting on Thursday, deal--

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.810
well, let me generalize first.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:40.470
There are three major
sections in this class.

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:44.910
Section one deals with the
nature of city form theory

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:51.270
and goes on till the fourth,
goes on till the sixth class.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:56.220
The first six classes deal
with examples and ideas

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.595
about the form of cities.

00:30:59.595 --> 00:31:02.260
There are three
analogical examples.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.250
The first one, which I'll
deal with on Thursday,

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:09.990
posits a metaphysical
relationship

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:14.400
between the form of
the city and the cosmos

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.670
that will deal with
all of the material

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.760
from paleontologists
and philosophers,

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:27.000
like Mircea Eliade,
who will argue

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.210
that the archaic
cities had connections

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:35.010
to celestial systems.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:38.560
We want to ask why.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.030
What are the
implications of survival,

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:45.450
in terms of practical
methods of dealing

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:48.750
with survival in the
form of the city,

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:52.920
as opposed to metaphysical?

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:59.850
Why is the temple of Marduk,
the city god of Babylon,

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:03.345
on top of the Tower of Babel?

00:32:03.345 --> 00:32:07.020
Estimates of the Tower of
Babel are about 300 feet

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.060
in brick and stone.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.430
You can't build much
taller than that,

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:15.660
although the pyramids of Giza
are about 300 meters, I think.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:25.870
Why place a temple
on top of a tower?

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:28.900
We will ask questions
of this kind.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:33.650
We will ask why, this
is one of the earlier--

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:35.380
and you can help us here--

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:39.430
one of the earliest
cities of dynastic China

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:43.810
has a pattern which resembles
the star system of the dipper.

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:54.815
Essentially, Lynch,
Mumford, Adams,

00:32:54.815 --> 00:32:58.270
are amongst the
major protagonists

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:03.280
of the cosmic theory
of archaic city form.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:08.030
By this theory, it means we know
where a city should be located.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.030
We have techniques
for finding the place

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:13.060
where it should
be best built. It

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:16.070
has a relationship
with survival.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:19.060
It has three-tiered systems.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.710
One of the things
I will do, is I

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:25.465
will give you a piece, a series
of pieces of paper every class.

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:29.910
So for instance,
instead of me having

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.790
to make a list of
all of the reasons

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:36.570
for why the cosmic, or what
the cosmic form can do,

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:40.740
I will hand it out to
you on a sheet of paper.

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.270
This is a gift.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:47.430
You would have 26 gifts
at the end of the semester

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:52.950
to add to your numerous
amounts of paper.

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:55.080
I will often show
a diagram which

00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:03.210
I can't show in slide form to
help us manipulate the class.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:06.600
I will sometimes try
to bring the class up

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.230
to date by giving you a
piece from the New York

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:11.400
Times that day.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:20.960
The New York Times will
come up in some of these.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.989
One of the problems with
teaching a class for 34 years

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:25.065
is that you get bored.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:31.400
Most of you who graduate from
MIT with advanced degrees

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.199
teach.

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:38.389
I don't know how you teach
the calculus for 34 years

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:41.420
without going around the bend.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:45.830
So what I try to do is to
teach the class differently

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:48.270
every time I teach it.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:51.560
So I will start off taking
a piece from this morning's

00:34:51.560 --> 00:35:00.440
paper on Hurricane Sandy and
what Mayor Bloomberg proposes

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:04.010
to do, and tie it
into the theory

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:06.890
that we're examining that day.

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:09.770
And I will give you that piece
of paper, or those sheets

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:12.230
of paper, sometimes three.

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:15.080
Sometimes I'll give
you a series of plans

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.570
which will take five pages.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:22.280
For instance, when we talk about
the Grand Paris competition,

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:28.010
I will give you excerpts
from the competition.

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:29.420
So I'll give you a paper.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.830
You can throw it away.

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:32.770
You can use it during the class.

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:34.250
It's an adjunct.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:35.900
You can give me gifts in return.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:40.440
Don't take that seriously.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:48.100
The second of the analogical
propositions we look at

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:51.370
will be the machine model.

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:56.260
These three models were derived
in this class with Kevin Lynch

00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:02.320
a number of years ago, and
I've adapted them for this

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.420
and modernized them.

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:09.970
The machine model
deals with everything

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:17.980
from the first grid city
to the laws of the Indies

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:23.980
to contemporary attempts
at machine interpretation.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:27.040
The fourth class looks
with the tradition

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:31.330
of regarding the city
as a function of nature

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:34.150
and looks to organic analogies.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:37.270
We will look at a
number of theorists

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:42.190
of this kind, Patrick Geddes,
Ebenezer Howard, and so on.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:44.290
But I will be
skeptical about this.

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:52.400
I'm skeptical about biomorphism,
and I will say I'm skeptical.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:56.080
I will go through
very briefly with you

00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.030
the history from 1933
of the greatest planning

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:06.100
effort in this country, the
Tennessee Valley Authority.

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:12.700
I will show you how in
1933, I will tell you

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:17.860
about Roosevelt's theoretical
understanding of nature.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:24.220
I will talk to you about the
Southern urbanists' reaction

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:29.280
to that, viewing nature in
a completely different way.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.810
I will talk to you about
Henry Ford's proposition

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:37.000
to build Muscle Shoals as an
industrial-agricultural city

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.610
instead of the new.

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:44.050
Henry Ford proposed to
the United States Congress

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:47.860
to buy the first
dam for $1 million,

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:53.020
and the Senator Norris,
great man, turned it down.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:58.740
Instead, we'll go on to
new images of nature,

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:02.460
and we'll talk about
the establishment

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:09.510
of the controversy about the
small fish in one of the dams.

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:14.760
We'll go on to the fact
that the 28 dams are now,

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:18.690
the 28 dams that are
built no longer provide

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:22.860
sufficient hydroelectric
energy, and 60%

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:27.990
of the industry supported by
electricity comes from coal.

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:32.010
The worst coal disaster, the
worst environmental disaster

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:36.930
in history took place in the
Tennessee Valley Authority.

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:38.800
You see what I'm trying to do?

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.200
I'm trying to say nature
is not a fixed commodity.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:48.490
In one project, there are annual
protests against the-- where

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:50.100
did the Manhattan Project--

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.920
where was the Manhattan Project?

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.230
It was in the Tennessee
Valley Authority.

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:59.065
There are anti-nuclear
protests every year.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.970
Nature is a difficult subject.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:09.000
Forget about nature.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.600
You're a human being.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.860
You have an animal.

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:15.670
You have a brain many,
many times the size

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:18.100
of any other living creature.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:22.210
Your decisions are not bad ones.

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:23.860
At least that's
my point of view.

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.030
I'm a humanist.

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.410
Forgive me.

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:30.250
I'm not a naturalist.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:33.970
We'll debate that proposition.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:36.280
I then will spend
two classes looking

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:40.390
at theoretical
propositions, one largely

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:45.410
from the social sciences,
economics, political science,

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:47.140
history, and so on.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:54.760
And then I will look at four
attempts to create reasonable

00:39:54.760 --> 00:40:00.400
theory, Lynch,
Martin, Alexander,

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:05.510
[? Brockin ?] and
[? Helia ?] as examples.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:07.810
We will stop there
with the introduction.

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:11.980
That is a large
introduction to the class.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:15.370
I will start Section 2
with the first early cities

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:16.420
of capitalism.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:26.420
Nothing that preceded
in human history,

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:29.210
as far as urbanization
is concerned,

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:35.550
is as important as what
happened from 1750 onwards.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:40.140
I will try to convince you
not to ignore urban history--

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.120
it's not taught anyway--

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:54.130
but to really concentrate on
the period from 1750 onwards.

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:56.440
The greatest event
in human history

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.745
is the Industrial Revolution.

00:40:57.745 --> 00:41:01.960
Why it took place in
England, why it took place

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:07.180
in the first place, we will look
at a number of theories which

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:14.080
explain that, including a
recent theoretical exploration

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:18.050
by a man from
California called Clark.

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:23.020
His book A Farewell to Alms
is an interesting biogenetic

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:33.430
attempt to explain the
change in human behavior

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:35.455
in the 19th century in England.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:45.400
In 1850, London was the
largest city in the world.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.650
It was the first city
in the world since Rome

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:52.000
to have achieve 1 million
population, more or less.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.450
We don't measure these
things very accurately.

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:58.720
At the same time,
the first rules

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:03.350
were introduced into boxing.

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:05.510
Why?

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:12.140
Medieval boxing was dealt
with cruelty to animals.

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:15.230
I would treat you to the
story about the burning

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:19.460
of a cat in front of
royalty in the population

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:22.010
in Paris in the 18th century.

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:29.100
Boxing in a medieval
sporting event was--

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:32.850
didn't separate big
giants from small men.

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:33.795
Women didn't box.

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:43.000
Cockfighting, Hemingway
says that bullfighting

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.820
is the last vestige of sport.

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:49.030
What he's saying is
that the transformation

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:56.530
from free-ranging animal-human
interaction in medieval sport

00:42:56.530 --> 00:43:01.300
changed dramatically
with industrialization.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:06.610
1855, the Marquis of
Queensbury rules in boxing

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:10.930
limited the length of boxing
around to two minutes, I think,

00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:14.380
or five minutes, whatever it is.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.900
That's when Manchester
United was formed.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:23.440
So we look at sport as an
analogy to culture in relation

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.580
to--

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.100
we'll deal with Marx.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.020
Not Marx, Marx, yes.

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:31.330
We'll always deal with Marx.

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:34.750
You can't avoid him.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:40.090
We'll deal with Engels' period
in Manchester and his book

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:43.960
The Condition of the
Working Class in England.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:48.220
We'll deal with a
number of things

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:50.870
when we do the case
study of London.

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:54.160
We'll deal with a number
of economic and social

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:59.950
transformation, which I
consider fundamental to any

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:02.440
consideration of a modern city.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:06.190
The first is the invention
of the mortgage system.

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:09.070
None of you know anything
about the mortgage system.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:11.740
Nobody knows very much.

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.750
Do you realize that
one of the great causes

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:16.450
for the American depression
was that you couldn't

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:20.800
engage in a domestic
mortgage to borrow money

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.830
for buying a house?

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:29.080
That was invented as part of
the feudal system in Manchester

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:33.790
and Birmingham in
the 1830's onwards.

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:38.650
I'll talk about the
conquest of cholera

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:44.140
in London, in the
building and the--

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.780
London in 1850 with
a million people

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:51.730
with the most filthy
city in world history.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:54.280
There were a number of
people who made livings

00:44:54.280 --> 00:45:00.370
just scavenging the dirt in
London, in the Thames, digging

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:02.845
out bodies, old waste.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:14.220
Cholera was considered to be
a disease through the air.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:18.330
A wonderful doctor,
there's this great book

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:20.860
which I refer to in reading.

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:32.510
The Ghost Map is
the book which goes

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:36.300
into detail about how this man
discovered that cholera was

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.610
a waterborne disease, which led
to the greatest public building

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:49.310
works in the history of London,
the redistribution of water

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:55.370
from the North and the South
into bypasses which takes

00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:59.555
the polluted water horizontally
away from the center of London.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.920
We'll do the same with Paris.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:07.310
Here I will deal with another
fundamental innovation,

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:09.710
and that's deficit spending.

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:14.090
You cannot do major works in a
city without borrowing money.

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:21.450
The great conflict amongst
the prefects of the Seine

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:27.990
until Haussmann about building
as much as the purse would

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:31.440
allow, which was very little.

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.680
Haussmann benefited
from the great work

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:38.460
of Saint-Simon and
other economists

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:41.550
which showed that if
you borrowed money,

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:46.500
you could pay it back
at enormous benefit.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:52.050
Haussmann borrowed enough
money in the years between 1850

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:55.740
and 1870 to rebuild Paris.

00:46:55.740 --> 00:47:01.350
That loan, those loans
were only repaid in 1928.

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:03.137
Deficit spending has become--

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:10.170
if you're interested, we can
talk about deficit spending,

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:13.060
national deficit spending.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:19.530
The great trauma, economically,
in United States politics

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:24.290
is an extension of
deficit spending.

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:28.850
Most of the Democrats
believe that a large deficit

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:33.180
isn't a fundamental flaw
in the economic system.

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:37.580
Republicans, by and large,
have the opposite position.

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:40.160
They believe that
a national economy

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:44.120
is much like
developing a mortgage.

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:46.310
You can't have too
large a mortgage,

00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:50.490
as opposed to how much
economic growth you have.

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:55.040
We will touch on this
economic distinction,

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:59.000
and I'll refer you to reading a
book by the Nobel Prize winner

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:07.040
Joseph Stiglitz, who talks
about the fundamental problem

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:11.690
of disparity, large disparities
of income as measured

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:17.310
by the Gini coefficient,
and economic growth.

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:21.920
But this starts in
Paris in the years,

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.570
in the 20-year period
from 1850 to 1870.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:28.940
Now, architects look
at Haussmann and say,

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:29.795
he built avenues.

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:36.350
If you don't like avenues,
you say he's a horrible man.

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:38.475
If you like avenues, then
you think he was a saint.

00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:43.970
He did lots of other
things than build avenues.

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:48.420
He built the avenues according
to an economic relationship

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:52.970
with the banks, which
allowed him to borrow

00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:54.470
enormous amounts of money.

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:03.660
So we'll move on from the case
studies of Paris and London,

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:05.390
which are classic--

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:06.500
I should hurry up--

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:13.820
to looking at one of the
conventional 19th century

00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:17.420
responses to the first
cities of capitalism,

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:20.580
and that's Barcelona.

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:28.380
We'll look at the genius
of Ildefons Cerda's

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:34.200
plan for Barcelona, the
largest housing plan in Europe,

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.040
a number of issues.

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:43.830
I presume some of you have
been to Barcelona and know

00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:45.570
the Ensanche.

00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:48.000
Almost every theorist
from Barcelona,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.040
including my friend
Morales, who died last year,

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:56.430
claims there's something
significant in the Ensanche.

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:58.020
I want to know what you think.

00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:01.650
Has anybody-- who's
been to Barcelona?

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:05.820
You all better go
before the class.

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:08.820
There are number of intriguing
things about the competition

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:15.690
which set one against a modern
proposition for modular growth,

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:19.590
as opposed to the neoclassical
proposition of the man

00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:20.415
who he defeated.

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:30.750
We'll look at it Ildefons
Cerda in a way which

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:33.690
very few people
tend to look at him,

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:38.280
and that's part of
a neo-Marxian notion

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.500
of what urbanism should be.

00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:48.370
We'll look at a man from
Paris who came to this country

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:50.840
with the new Icarian system.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:55.520
Anyway, we'll look
at Vienna, again,

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.770
as the reuse of infrastructure.

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:04.400
Vienna is interesting
for a number of ways,

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:11.230
not only the building
of the Ringstrasse,

00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:16.790
but for the 1683 attempt by the
Ottoman Empire to take Vienna.

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:20.390
Vienna was within one
morning of being taken over

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:22.280
by the Ottomans.

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:28.940
The Ottomans succeeded in
defeating Christianity in 1453

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:34.820
by using a German
cannon which had

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:42.560
to be schlepped across Europe
to Istanbul by 30 oxen.

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:45.230
They had to build bridges
on the way over there

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:47.060
to cross a waterway.

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:49.800
When they brought
it to Istanbul,

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:53.420
it destroyed the Christian
double wall and moat

00:51:53.420 --> 00:52:02.150
by sending rocks
1,300 meters away.

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:09.650
The attempt to defeat Vienna
after crossing all the way

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:14.330
from Istanbul is very
well-documented in a very good

00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:15.260
book.

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:18.440
But the savior of
Vienna for Christianity

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:23.960
by the intervention of the
King of Poland's cavalry

00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:26.780
is one of these extraordinary
events in history

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:29.180
which, had it not
happened, Vienna

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:35.450
would have been an Islamic
city, and Europe's future

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:44.510
would have been without Sigmund
Freud, Beethoven, Mozart, et

00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:46.530
cetera, et cetera.

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:48.320
Now, that may be
better for Europe.

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:51.420
I'm not arguing that I know.

00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:54.140
But it's one of the cardinal--

00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:59.170
it's in connection
with the wall,

00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:05.140
because the Islamic
engineers dug under the Earth

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:11.050
and built a tunnel under the
southern wall into the center.

00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:15.700
So walls didn't pay
off, altogether.

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.350
After these case studies--

00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:20.550
well, the last of the case
studies will be Chicago.

00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:25.720
Chicago has no aristocracy,
only a middle class

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:31.930
and immigrant population,
and is one of the few great

00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:34.180
19th century cities.

00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:36.910
Which other cities were
developed in the 19th century?

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:43.150
Can you name me one?

00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:48.203
AUDIENCE: San Francisco.

00:53:48.203 --> 00:53:49.870
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah,
it's a bit dubious

00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:51.800
about what its origins are.

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.020
But you are maybe right.

00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:56.710
Johannesburg is certainly one.

00:53:56.710 --> 00:54:00.940
Chicago is unusual in
really only having been

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:06.010
developed from 1830 onwards.

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:10.840
Chicago is also unbelievably
interesting in relation

00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:18.230
to the role of
the private sector

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:20.880
in the development of a city.

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:25.520
The European examples
really deal with governance.

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.850
The private sector
in Chicago built

00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:32.030
an illegal underground
subway system

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:35.650
without the city knowing it.

00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:39.635
Now, if you have a city
which has enough hubris

00:54:39.635 --> 00:54:46.100
to allow a private subway
system to be built,

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:50.570
it also deals with the
Chicago World's Fair

00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:53.450
and the various
episodes leading to it.

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:56.690
We'll spend some time going
through the Chicago World's

00:54:56.690 --> 00:55:01.400
Fair, and we'll contrast it with
The Devil in the White City,

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:06.410
the book which many
of you probably know,

00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:11.330
and the incredible lack
of public governance

00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:14.270
in a city which
was being developed

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:15.365
by the private sector.

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:24.920
Section 2 will end with two
classes, one on utopianism,

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.920
which I dislike as an idea.

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.440
But we'll do the class anyway.

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.390
You may enjoy it more than I do.

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:38.730
But the interesting--
we'll realize

00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:46.860
the link between
English and the Shakers.

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:48.920
Do you realize
that the woman who

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:55.650
started the Shaker movement
came from Manchester,

00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:59.480
and after having, I think,
her fifth stillborn baby,

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:03.110
she reviled against six,
left to the United States,

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:06.110
and came to start
the Shaker utopian

00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:07.785
movement in this country.

00:56:07.785 --> 00:56:10.160
There's a relationship
between the evils

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:17.960
of capitalism, pre-hygiene
and the utopian movement.

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:22.250
Utopianism has many
interesting followers.

00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:26.870
And then we'll do a brief
look at some 20th century

00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:30.380
organizations in England,
the British Town Planning

00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:42.380
Movement after 1946, and the
socialist city in Russia.

00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:45.260
Look, all of these
are enormous topics,

00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:48.080
and I'm just going to
select a couple of ideas

00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:50.540
and go with those ideas.

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:53.865
This is an enormous
attic of stuff.

00:56:53.865 --> 00:57:00.300
This class is over-fat
and tries to do too much.

00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:05.165
It's the accumulation of 34
years of not being on a diet.

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:12.020
So you have thoughts of
the fragments of stuff.

00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:18.830
The last half of the class
deals with current theory

00:57:18.830 --> 00:57:21.240
and practice.

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:25.010
The first section deals
with the question,

00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:27.170
is there a
relationship, or what is

00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:31.610
the relationship between the
way a city is made and its form?

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:39.890
The second group deal with,
what is the relationship

00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:43.790
between social structure
and spatial structure?

00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:50.240
And here we do case studies
of Jerusalem, Johannesburg,

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:58.040
the border between Mexico and
the United States, and colonial

00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.180
Delhi in India.

00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:09.920
That takes us to the
third week of April,

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:12.020
and it's spring already, I hope.

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:21.020
And we can keep these windows
open for the sun to come in.

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:23.870
I deal with a number
of propositions,

00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:27.635
formal propositions,
number 20, four models--

00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:34.130
sorry, number 19, four models.

00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:38.780
One deals with modern
and postmodern urbanism,

00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:40.790
deals with the
origin of modernism,

00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:46.400
and mainly the CIM
discourse on urbanism

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:50.540
and some reactions to it.

00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:52.880
Number 20 deals
with the proposition

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:56.480
about the city as an
opportunity for building

00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:01.970
in an open-ended fashion,
questions of prophecy,

00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:05.300
questions of
imagining the future,

00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:09.770
questions of finding
formal structures which

00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:17.310
can accommodate change with the
minimum cost are part of this.

00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:19.940
I will look at the
previous research done

00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:25.310
at the Cambridge University
Build Form and Land Use Studies

00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:30.170
Group, Leslie Martin
for six weeks.

00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:35.820
I will look at the opposite
notion in the work,

00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:39.890
in the theories of Leon
Krier and Aldo Rossi, two

00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:43.960
European theorists,
which those of you

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:50.630
will know from
architecture, postulating

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:55.280
that it is the past that
should govern any preoccupation

00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.980
with the form of a city.

00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:02.930
Rossi has a theory
of monumentality

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:05.120
which we need to examine.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:11.810
Krier has some intelligent
but really remarkably stupid

01:00:11.810 --> 01:00:19.730
notions about classicism, and
the revival of classicism,

01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:23.330
and that cities were great
during classical times.

01:00:23.330 --> 01:00:29.330
And this is the derivation
from neoclassicism which

01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:33.180
we need to look at carefully.

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:39.350
We need to take a careful
look at the way in which we

01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:42.300
derive notions from history.

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:48.635
The next class
deals with memory.

01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:56.216
Memory and history are two
different things in urbanism.

01:00:56.216 --> 01:01:00.350
I will try to explain it through
the attempt, to which all of us

01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:04.670
have, for maintaining
continuity.

01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:15.200
We'll deal with the work, the
writing of Maurice Halbwachs,

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:22.070
the book Collective Memory, and
other examples of the conflict

01:01:22.070 --> 01:01:24.230
between history and memory.

01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:28.580
Pierre Nora is writing
about the French,

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:32.930
about the loss of living
memory through history,

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:39.930
that history displaces
living memory, and so on.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:46.040
But the fact that we
now have more stuff

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:53.670
in cities than ever before,
and are building less and less

01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:58.950
and reusing more
and more material

01:01:58.950 --> 01:02:03.180
argues for look at memory.

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:08.070
The last few classes
deal with the difference,

01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:10.770
the contemporary difference
between the public and private

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:17.160
domain, the relationship
between the external,

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.780
the [NON-ENGLISH] and
the [NON-ENGLISH],,

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:26.730
the suburbs and the center
city in the United States.

01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:29.190
The last few classes
will take a brief look

01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:39.070
at splintering urbanism,
the effective modern virtual

01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:41.260
communication
systems on the form,

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:49.180
of the predicted form of
cities, take a brief look

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:57.490
at the effective issues
of climate change

01:02:57.490 --> 01:03:00.220
and sustainability.

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:06.540
On the last day of
class, I will deal

01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:12.825
with a major issue of the
Gini coefficient and poverty.

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:20.760
In my view, one
issue which urbanism

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.450
is doing less about
than any other,

01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:29.710
and is theoretically seemingly
incapable of doing that,

01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:32.280
that is reducing
the level of poverty

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:37.920
in the non-European,
non-American world.

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:41.640
That's an animal, a
nasty animal which

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:47.310
we bypass, as we do any serious
attempt at universal climate

01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:48.780
change theory.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:02.650
It's what I think the
nasty future holds for us,

01:04:02.650 --> 01:04:07.790
and we'll end with that
rather dismal proposition.

01:04:07.790 --> 01:04:10.150
On the other hand,
I'll at the same time

01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:12.820
be talking about the
wonderful successes

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:22.270
that we've achieved
over 10,000 years,

01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:24.355
well, a little more
than 10,000 years,

01:04:24.355 --> 01:04:27.220
but 10,000 of
human history, just

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:32.830
to be able to teach this
class with all of this stuff.

01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:34.730
Whether it's a good
class or a bad class

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:37.770
is only due to the
fact that we've

01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:40.140
accumulated enough experience.

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:44.400
We've had enough human minds
thinking about urbanism

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.600
for this period of time.

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.200
It's a major, major achievement.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.250
Marx is right.

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:55.070
Without cities, there'd
be no civilization.

01:04:55.070 --> 01:05:00.150
And without civilization, we
wouldn't be sitting here today.

01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:03.200
But the two gaps, one
of which, of course,

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.725
Marx and Engels
made a living off

01:05:05.725 --> 01:05:11.150
was picking up on the
notion of the inability

01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:16.370
to deal with the unnatural
distinction between wealth

01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:24.170
and poverty, and what that
means in the latest attempts

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:28.520
by groups such as Slum
Dwellers International.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:31.250
I don't know if any of you saw
the exhibition at the United

01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:37.460
Nations last year or
the year before produced

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:43.180
by the Cooper Hewitt museum
on third world cities.

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:47.750
OK, so you don't know.

01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:49.040
What else?

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:50.595
Is that enough for one semester?

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:56.090
We're going to go
quickly, and I am not

01:05:56.090 --> 01:06:00.680
going to be able to explain
second order, third order

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.220
issues.

01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:05.000
This is an open-ended system.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.490
It's got infinite dimensions.

01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:10.850
We're going to look at
the core dimensions.

01:06:10.850 --> 01:06:14.510
And if they lead
us outward, great.

01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:17.420
Maybe you'll have a
universal theory of urbanism

01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:19.010
by the end of this class.

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:21.410
I haven't got one.

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:23.651
Any questions?

01:06:23.651 --> 01:06:27.200
You're all very silent.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:39.380
If you find a piece of reading
in this class schedule,

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:42.810
you will find the reference in
the thicker bibliography I've

01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:47.710
given you, if it's up to date.

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:50.000
And I hope it is.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.380
I check it every year and
try to keep it up to date.

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:57.100
If you have any trouble
with a book or a reference,

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.990
just send me an email.

01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:02.350
I like the email system,
because it allows

01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:06.380
me to do things in my own time.

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:09.200
But if you need to
talk, let's talk.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:12.290
That's an open invitation.

01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:13.940
We are all very busy people.

01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:19.210
So for instance,
when I mentioned

01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:26.440
Halbwachs and his book, The
Collective Memory, it's not--

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:29.420
I will quote a bit
from it in the class.

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:33.820
But I purposely didn't put
it as required reading,

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:35.670
because you'd have to
read the whole book.

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.260
There's a part of me
which had an upbringing

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:47.530
that I had to read whole books.

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:50.800
You couldn't read a
piece of Shakespeare.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.570
We were beaten over our heads.

01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:57.040
We've got five minutes.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:00.790
We were beaten over
our heads if we

01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:08.560
came in and read only a piece
of Henry V, famous speech.

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:13.030
I am understanding of the
amount of energy and time

01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:16.270
it takes to read.

01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:19.120
So I've tried to
give the required

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.410
readings as parts of books.

01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:24.430
There's not one whole book
that I've referred to.

01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:26.920
In the case of Halbwachs,
it's very difficult

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:30.550
to extract a chapter.

01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:32.460
There's a wonderful
chapter on memory

01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:35.350
in music, which fascinates me.

01:08:35.350 --> 01:08:39.250
I mean, whenever I hear somebody
conducting Mahler's Ninth

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:44.120
Symphony without a
score, I'm amazed

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:49.210
at how it is humanly possible
to understand such complex music

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:56.569
and direct it for two hours, an
hour and 40 minutes, perhaps.

01:08:56.569 --> 01:09:00.229
He tries to explain that
individual memory is

01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:03.649
impossible, that
the social memory is

01:09:03.649 --> 01:09:05.424
what creates individual memory.

01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:13.910
He was a collectivist
sociologist

01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:18.109
and wrote some brilliant
things about memory.

01:09:18.109 --> 01:09:20.930
But there's a case,
if you read the book,

01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:24.200
it'll be worth reading.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.510
Maybe I'll excite
you about the book.

01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:31.250
OK, I'll see you next
Thursday, if you continue.

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:34.869
If you don't, good luck
with the rest of your life.
