00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.340
PROFESSOR: So let's
go through, now,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.980
how we can parameterize
our guideline specifically

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.750
for COVID-19 by looking at
specific superspreading events.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.100
So the event that was analyzed
in great detail first,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.060
and which is going to
be of most use for us

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.980
initially for parameterizing
the guideline,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.240
is the Skajit Valley Chorale
superspreading incident.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.260
So this was, again, a 2
and 1/2 hour choir practice

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.700
involving 61 people, one of
whom was known to be infected.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.650
The practice lasted
2 and 1/2 hours.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.430
And in the end, there were 53
infected people, two of whom

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.140
later died.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.280
So this was a large room with
a height of 4 and 1/2 meters

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.150
and an area of 180
meters squared.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.520
It was poorly ventilated.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.360
The heat was on for a
certain amount of time

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.530
and then taken off.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.220
And the average air change rate
was estimated at 0.65 per hour.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.030
And of course, the people were
singing for much of the time,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.500
leading to much higher
rates of droplet emission.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.620
And in fact, I think we can
assume for this event, given

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.050
the huge number
of infections that

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.930
occurred in such a short
time, that the index patient--

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.130
the index case-- was at
near the peak viral load,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.990
peak of infection.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.700
And also, that allows us to
make a conservative estimate

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.630
of using that for
calibrating our guideline.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.289
So if we look at
the figure here,

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.170
we can see the
droplet distributions

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.720
taken from experimental
measurements

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.500
of Morawska et al in 2009.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.620
And those droplet distributions
have been fed into the model

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.770
that we just described
and evolved in time

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.610
in such a way that corresponds
to the conditions of the Skajit

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.600
Valley Choir itself.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.860
And so what we can see is
that the droplet distribution

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.960
corresponding to singing--

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.430
or the closest
approximation of singing,

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.860
which are measurements
of voiced aahs

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.079
from the original experiment--

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.100
that distribution is much
bigger than all the others.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.430
It has a very broad tail
to somewhat larger sizes.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.240
But it has a peak
just below 1 micron.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.940
Similarly, the other
types of activities

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.760
measured in the
original study, which

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.140
correspond to, for example,
whispered ahh or speaking

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.680
or in counting of
numbers, for example,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.710
or various forms of breathing
through the nose and the mouth

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.450
or only through the nose--

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.590
all those distributions have
much lower sort of magnitude

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.300
or number of drops.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.320
And this is also drop volume.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.860
We have accounted for the
size of the drops as well.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.310
So it's the total droplet volume
per total volume or volume

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.430
fraction.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.980
And the peak of all
the distributions

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.520
is in a similar place,
just below 1 micron,

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.130
so again, corresponding
to the aerosol range.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.680
And it's important that we take
those droplet distributions

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.630
and evolve them in the
Skajit Valley Choir space.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.410
So then, we can figure out
which of those droplets

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.370
survived and would be in the air
and would be then corresponding

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.060
to the airborne
transmission and can

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.420
be compared with the actual
spreading events that occurred

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.490
using the Wells-Riley model.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.240
So is it a short amount of time?

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.950
We're going to assume there was
no delay caused by incubation.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.620
But rather, people were getting
infected but not passing it

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.650
on to anybody else.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.430
And so we will use
the Wells-Riley model.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.730
So when we do that
fitting, we come out

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.820
with a value of Cq, the number
of infection quanta per volume

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.520
in the exhaled breath
of the infected person,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.480
around 900 quanta
per meter cubed.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.430
A published study
of Miller et al

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.290
came to a similar conclusion
of 870 quanta per meters cubed.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.170
And so we can take that to be
a reasonable value for singing.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.550
Now, if we go to
the next figure,

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:27.000
we can include all of these
estimated total quanta

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.570
concentrations corresponding
to different hypothetical forms

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.180
of respiration in the
Skajit Valley Choir

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.800
and use that for rescaling.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.390
So we can say, the choir was
actually involving singing.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.909
And that gave us a
number around 900.

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.760
And then if we rescale,
the other amounts

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.500
of respiratory
droplets corresponding

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.010
to different activities would
have correspondingly scaled

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.960
values of Cq.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.140
And as a further calibration,
we can compare it

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.550
with another recent study
of Asadi and Ristenpart,

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.650
where again, different types
of respiratory activities

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.970
were measured for their
aerosol size distributions,

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.180
including speaking at
different levels of volume

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.010
and also breathing
in different ways.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.910
And if we line up
two values that

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.120
correspond to sort of
intermediate speech

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.240
as a calibration, then
we find that the quanta

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.880
values that we infer--

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.870
the Cq values-- for both of
those independent studies

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.320
of respiratory droplets
really correlate nicely

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.990
across different
types of activities

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.920
from breathing to
speaking to singing,

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.420
allowing us a consistent
definition of Cq,

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.850
again, for a situation
corresponding

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.370
to most likely peak infectivity.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.240
So we are talking about
sort of the worst case

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.300
scenario in order to derive
a conservative guideline.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.290
It should also be noted that the
median age of the choir members

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.000
was 69.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.790
And by using this
spreading incident,

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.270
we are again being conservative,
because it is well established

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.610
that elderly persons have an
elevated risk of complications

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.430
and even death from
COVID-19, and perhaps also

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.970
some evidence showing
increased risk of transmission.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.680
So therefore, when we
apply the guideline

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.900
to a general
population, including

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.180
younger and healthy
people, that we

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.090
will find that we are making
a conservative estimate,

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.470
which is our goal.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.190
So at this point, we have a
fully parameterized guideline.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.040
And we have consistent
values of Cq

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.770
across a range of
respiratory activities

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.909
involving two different studies
of respiratory aerosols,

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:48.010
all coming from the
Skajit Choir incident.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.280
So now, let's look at some
other spreading incidents

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.490
to see if we can get
consistent values of Cq

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.710
in cases where people
were not singing

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.930
and where the size of
the room was different,

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.310
and sort of see
if we really have

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.990
a transferable inference here.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.570
And if we do find
consistent numbers,

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.820
it provides further
evidence to support

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.400
the hypothesis of
airborne transmission

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.930
in all of these cases.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.600
So the next example
we'll look at

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.470
is the incident of the Tiantong
Temple religious ceremony

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.460
and, in particular, the buses
that went back and forth

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.990
from that ceremony.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:27.120
One bus, in particular, was
similar to this Dongfeng tour

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:34.590
bus luxury liner,
which underwent

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:41.370
a 100-minute trip to Ningbo and
then back in the same seating.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:46.020
The bus had seating for 68,
or had 68 persons in it.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.390
The total time was 1.7 hours.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.310
And the one infected
person managed

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:54.300
to infect around 21
others, when we account

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.560
for some that may have been
infected at the event, given

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.670
the low rate of infection to
people outside of the bus.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:06.030
Using those numbers
and taking into

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.160
account the size of
the bus and the fact

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.110
that there was no
forced ventilation--

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:11.220
this was a winter ride.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.930
And there was only
natural ventilation--

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.000
and if we use a value
that's been measured

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.550
for other types of
public transit buses

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.730
where no forced
ventilation is occurring,

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.640
then we conclude that
the Cq for this event

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.910
is around 72 quanta
per meter cubed, which

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:30.240
is a very consistent estimate
with what we obtained before

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.990
for a situation where
people are perhaps speaking

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.340
in an intermediate tone on
a noisy bus over that period

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.270
of time.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.590
It's also important to
note that a recent analysis

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:47.070
of the incident
involving interviews

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:51.270
of all the people involved
established that there

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.720
was no correlation between
the position of a person

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.180
with respect to the infected
person in the seating

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.620
chart of the bus relative
to whether they got infected

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.380
or not.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.240
So in other words, it was
not short-range transmission

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.670
through puffs or
respiratory jets.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.430
But instead somehow,
there was a circulation

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.730
throughout the bus of
infected air as the most

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.700
plausible explanation.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.910
Our third example is
the Diamond Princess.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:26.350
So this was the
quarantined cruise ship

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.930
in Yokohama Port, Japan.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:33.340
There were 3,011 passengers
and crew onboard.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.730
And the quarantine
lasted for 12 days,

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:41.110
or around 288 hours, at which
point people began to leave.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.690
And we won't use any
data from that point.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:45.280
The quarantine is a
good chance for us

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.430
to study airborne transmission,
because people were largely

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:49.630
confined to their room.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.240
So of course, some of the crew
were going back and forth,

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.450
bringing food and checking
on the passengers.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.090
But the vast majority of
people were essentially

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.260
cooped up in their room
with their fellow travelers

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.930
or family members
in small groups,

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:07.330
typically with the windows
closed because this

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.330
was in the winter,
and with ventilation

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.360
which was doing a significant
amount of recirculation

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.010
between the rooms.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.050
And in fact,
transmission occurred

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.360
across different
rooms, where people

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.630
did not have direct contact
with a known infected person

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.330
and yet still managed
to get infected.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.630
In those 12 days, the number
of infections grew very rapidly

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.320
and, in fact, had sort of
an exponential increase.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.840
So in the end, there
were 354 infected persons

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.470
when they began releasing
passengers after 12 days.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.250
And the fact that the shape of
the infections versus time is

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:49.620
an increasing exponential-like
curve suggests that this cannot

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.720
be modeled by the Wells-Riley
equation, where instead,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.110
the number of infected people
has to saturate as you run out

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:57.460
of susceptibles.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.060
So this acceleration
of the number

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:05.680
of infected people with time is
best attributed to incubation.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.650
And it is known that the
incubation time for COVID-19

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.330
is around 5.5 days.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:11.830
Some people may
have been infected,

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.500
and likely were infected, before
the start of the quarantine.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.390
So there definitely
were infected people

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.540
generating newly infectious
people during the time

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.280
of the quarantine.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:27.160
So as a simple analysis of
this incident, we can use--

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.330
or let us use--

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.510
our model for fast incubation.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:35.140
We have an analytical solution
for the trend in the number

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.470
of cases versus time.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.530
And as you can
see in the figure,

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:42.340
this model has a pretty
good fit to the growth

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.150
in the number of cases.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:49.360
And if we fit that model and
infer what is the value of Cq,

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.270
then we come out with a
number around 30 quanta

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.360
per meter cubed, again,
very consistent with all

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.350
the other inferences and
basically consistent with light

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:05.560
activity, light normal speech,
and sort of resting breathing

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.820
that was going on in the ship.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:14.140
Now, there definitely could
be some debate over the way

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.140
that we've just analyzed the
ship, in the sense that we

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.730
had analyzed it
from the perspective

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.320
of a well-mixed ship.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.980
So we're assuming that the
infectious aerosols were spread

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.350
throughout the ship uniformly.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.790
So that is obviously a
gross estimate, very crude.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.280
On the other hand, we get
a very reasonable result.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.850
And there is evidence that
transmission was occurring

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.360
through the vents, through the
hallways, and through the air

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.260
to large numbers of people.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.840
And so the fact that we get a
reasonably consistent number

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.790
of 30 quanta per
meter cubed compared

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.770
to all of our other
estimates does

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.070
support the idea of airborne
transmission occurring

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.560
in a somewhat uniform
and well-mixed fashion

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.470
across the ship.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.270
Yet another inference
we could make

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.280
would be to look at
the initial spreading

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:09.150
of the epidemic in Wuhan, China,
where it first originated.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.090
So there have been
a number of studies

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:12.710
of the initial spreading.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.500
And the reproductive
number of the spreading

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:20.160
of the disease, R0, has been
estimated to be around 3.5.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.710
In fact, there's a
range of estimates

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.710
from that time period, given the
sort of somewhat limited data.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:28.700
But that's the agreed
upon average number.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.610
Now, there is an
interesting thought exercise

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.750
we can do looking at that
number if we make the assumption

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.000
that the majority
of transmissions

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.340
occurred indoors, in people's
family homes or apartments.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:47.210
So if we take the time
period for the spreading

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:51.110
of the infection in our
analysis to be 5.5 days, which

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.240
is the average
incubation time, and we

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.480
use the average size
of a Chinese household

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.650
in that region of
3.03 people, and we

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.920
assume an average size of a
Chinese apartment for that size

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.010
family of 90 meters
cubed, and we also

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.910
assume measured typical
natural ventilation

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:17.020
rates for this time of winter
of around 0.3 per hour,

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:21.020
or a 3-hour air change
time roughly, then

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.900
interestingly enough,
from that analysis,

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.600
we find Cq again is
30 quanta per meter

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.150
cubed, the same as
the number that we

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.850
got for the Diamond Princess.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.190
So again, this is a
very crude estimate.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.130
This analysis is even more crude
than the analysis of the ship.

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.380
We're looking at the entire
population of a city.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.470
And we're assuming that
the spreading is happening

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.750
in people's homes when
they spend time together

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.840
for long periods of time,
sharing indoor air which

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.720
is typically not
very well ventilated,

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.700
and not wearing
masks, importantly.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.820
So at that time,
people were absolutely

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.190
wearing masks outside the house.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.650
And in fact, for
much of that time,

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.470
people were confined
to their apartments

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.470
even under threat of force
from the authorities.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.990
So people were definitely
spending a lot of time

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.760
in their homes with
their families.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.060
And it's interesting to observe
that despite that quarantine

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.850
that the spreading still
occurred fairly rapidly.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.230
And it occurred
in a way which is

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.640
consistent with indoor
transmission in people's homes.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.590
So if we take all
of this analysis

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:25.520
and come back to our
figure of Cq values--

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.790
again, that's the number
of infection quanta

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.620
per meter cubed
of exhaled breath

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.630
for an infected individual--

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.620
then we can put our inferences
for the Ningbo bus, the Diamond

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.410
Princess, and the Wuhan
outbreak on the same plot

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:45.590
as the values we inferred by
rescaling the value of 900

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.500
for the Skajit Valley Chorale.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.780
And what we find, again,
is a very consistent set

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.440
of estimates over a range of
respiratory activities, which

00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:01.790
tells us that the Cq is around
on the order of 10 or so,

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:06.020
or tens, for light activity
and resting breathing.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.250
It's in the range of 10 to
100, or maybe several hundred,

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:11.900
for speech at different
levels of volume,

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.910
which roughly-- the
number of droplets

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.480
is known to increase roughly
linearly with the decibel level

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.470
of speech.

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:21.620
And then singing has a more--

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.950
obviously a much, much
greater release of

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.870
particles and aerosols.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:30.770
And that's at a much higher
level, in the many hundreds.

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:34.790
So I think those are fairly
consistent numbers, which

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:38.210
again, looking at most of
these cases, are conservative

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:40.460
and could be applied
in the guideline

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.970
to a wide range of
examples involving

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.790
other types of populations,
which may be healthier,

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.460
younger, less
likely to transmit,

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.440
compared to all of these
super spreading incidents.
