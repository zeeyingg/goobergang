00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.050
PROFESSOR: So we've just
discussed the mass balance that

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.680
results from considering
ventilation and breathing

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.650
of an infected individual
in a room leading

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.560
to a build up and
then steady state

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.750
of aerosol droplets that are
infectious in the indoor air.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.180
We've also briefly
talked about masks.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.540
I'd now like to introduce the
possibility of filtration,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.530
which is actually very common in
mechanical ventilation systems.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.380
And then arrive at a
very simple comparison

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.180
of filtration versus mask use
as strategies for preventing

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.390
indoor transmission.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.190
So here's a schematic
sketch of the air flows.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.700
So basically, we
still have this Q,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.240
which is the outdoor air flow.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.580
So that is the air which is
coming in from the outdoors.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.760
And for mass balance, it
also has to be leaving.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.500
And the air change rate
is based on that Q.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.660
And in fact, if I remember, if
there's a volume V of the room,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.710
then the air change
rate was Q/V. So that's

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.060
of units of inverse time.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.800
So that's the time,
roughly, it takes for--

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.430
the residence time
for the outdoor air,

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.050
and also for the
changing of the air.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.670
Now, in addition to
that, though, there

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.130
could be significant
recirculation of air.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.780
Now, if the air is recirculating
but not filtering the droplets

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.470
in any way, then
it really doesn't

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.690
concern our calculation,
which is basically

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.759
just a mass balance.

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.140
So if I'm just swirling the
air around, or even taking it

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.820
outside and back in,
as long as I'm not

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.910
losing some droplets
in the ducts,

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.080
then it really doesn't
matter if it's recirculating.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.050
But what is of interest to us
is if in that recirculation

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.820
we lose some droplets.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.740
So some droplets
could be lost simply

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.259
to settling on the walls
of the ducts or the heating

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.420
and ventilation and air
conditioning, HVAC, unit.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.660
But more interesting
is to consider

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.910
what would happen if we
actually placed filters, which

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.640
is very common in HVAC systems.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.699
So we could either have
one of those big filters

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.910
that you stick into the
heating or ventilation ducts.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.900
And those typically
are given MERV

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.860
ratings, which are Mean
Efficiency Rating Values.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.000
And we're interested in
the filtration of aerosols.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.090
And so if Pf is the fraction of
the aerosols that are blocked--

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.390
and we roughly would look at
a size range, for example,

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.180
less than 5 micron radius--

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.460
then the difference
of ratings of filters

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.180
give you anywhere from
20% to 90% filtration.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.950
And then a very
high quality filter

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.660
would be a so-called
Hepa filter,

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.040
which is a High Efficiency
Particle Air filtration unit.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.040
And that would give you
even as high as 99.97%.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.370
And also, it's worth emphasizing
that you could also have

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.850
a freestanding filtration unit.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.790
There are a variety of different
kinds of filtration units.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.310
It could be a fan which is
blowing through a Hepa filter.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.660
And it could be a
freestanding unit in the room.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.380
It could also be
more exotic systems,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.200
such as electrostatic
precipitators, where the air is

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.790
flowing into a chamber that
has a very high electric field,

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.460
and the droplets are
basically projected

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.500
and deposited onto a surface.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.340
It could be flowing the air
through a UV-concentrated light

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.030
treatment to kill the virus.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.360
So you're not actually
removing the droplets, per se,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.070
but you are removing the virus.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.810
And since we've
been keeping track

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.360
of the concentration
of virions, they

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.240
could be deactivated
in that way.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.660
And so all of that
can essentially

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.760
be lumped into this simple
picture of a recirculating flow

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.329
rate Qf, and a filtration
efficiency, Pf.

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.860
So let's revisit our
equations from last time.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.780
So our mass balance
is at V dC dt

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.079
is P, which is the production
rate of infectious air

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.490
by an infected person.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.460
We have the removal of air
by the outer flow rate,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.810
which we've already discussed.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.360
And now we have the new
term which is Pf Qf.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.040
So if Pf is 1, then the
entire filtration flow

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.200
is removing droplets.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.440
On the other hand, if Pf
is 0, this term goes away.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.690
And that's the limit where
you're simply recirculating

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.230
air, but you're not
actually removing

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.550
any infectious droplets,
and it's playing no role.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.190
So this is basically
our only new term here.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.180
And so what this means is
we get the same calculation,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.030
same as before, but we just have
to make a little replacement.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.030
What was before Q is now--

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.220
notice we can lock-- oops,
I've forgotten, actually,

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.490
here there should be
a C here, actually.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.570
Because the flow rate-- or
the flux of infectious air

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.760
is the concentration
of infectious air, so

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.680
the concentration of virions
per volume times the flow rate,

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.150
that thing gives me
the correct value.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.690
So the Pf a dimensionless
number between 0 and 1.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:10.290
So anyway, Q gets
replaced by Q plus Pf Qf.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.910
And also, wherever we
saw a lambda a, that gets

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:20.750
replaced by lambda a just
from the outdoor air plus

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:28.150
lambda f, where
lambda f is Qf over V.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.840
So that's the recirculating
or filtration air change.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:46.200
So it's the recirculation or
filtration air change rate,

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.970
whereas lambda a is the
outdoor air change rate.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.680
And we can also talk about
the balance between these two.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.610
And so that's also something
which is reported or measured

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.200
for ventilation systems.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.390
And that's sometimes
called Z, which

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.650
is the outdoor air fraction.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.440
So that would be lambda a
over lambda a plus lambda f.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.030
Or we could also write
it as Q over Q plus Qf.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:25.910
This is the outdoor air fraction
of the ventilation system.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.360
So another way to
talk about ventilation

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.230
is you give the total flow rate.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.840
So as I sketched
here, there could

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.540
be a fan which is in the
heating, ventilation,

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.150
and air conditioning unit,
which is just pumping out

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.830
air at a certain rate.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.830
That air is mixing
the recirculated air

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.440
and the fresh air with
a fraction Z, which

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.460
is the outdoor air fraction.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.750
And so actually, this might be,
for example, a typical value

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.130
is around 20% for
many indoor spaces,

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.580
such as businesses
or classrooms.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.620
And basically, you have
to tune this number

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.180
to make sure that
enough fresh air is

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.820
coming in for the
occupants that are present.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.310
And also, you don't want
this number too high,

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.120
because typically the outdoor
air is not comfortable air.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.730
It either is too cold or too
hot or has the wrong humidity.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.970
And so you save a lot of energy
in your heating ventilating

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.390
system by keeping this number
as low as it can be effectively,

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.410
so that you're just
recirculating quality air that

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.350
is at the right temperature
and the right humidity.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.690
However, that desire to save
energy, and hence also save

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.900
carbon emissions and
other related things,

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.700
goes against what we're
talking about here,

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.600
though, is that when
you recirculate the air

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.150
and you don't take
in fresh air, it's

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.960
actually much worse for
any airborne pathogens that

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.480
might be transferred.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.350
So there's a
competition here where

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.500
you design an air ventilation
system to make sure

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.110
that you're saving energy,
but also that you're

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.560
keeping the place safe for
potential airborne transmission

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.850
of disease.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.770
OK, so if we just
take this change here,

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.940
we can replace these
quantities in the result

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.940
that we already derived.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.070
So I don't have to go
through all that again,

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.850
but I can just say that the
disease transmission rate--

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.300
and this would be
in steady state,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.910
just to give us something
concrete to look at--

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.380
that's what I called beta bar.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.200
And let's now write
down the same result,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.130
but just make this change here.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:32.830
So we have Qb squared,
that's the breathing rate.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.460
We have Cq, that's the
concentration of infection

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:42.049
quanta per volume in the exhaled
breath of a sick individual,

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:43.650
an infected individual.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.530
There was Pm squared.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.370
I'll write different colors
just to emphasize that.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.100
And then in the denominator,
we had lambda a, but now

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.920
it's going to be lambda
a plus Pf lambda f--

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.550
and I'll write that
in a separate color

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.500
in just a moment-- times volume.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.900
So here's Pf.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:07.890
So now, in this formula, we
have the effects of masks

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.090
and the effects of air
filtration together.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.640
And so we can ask
the question that I

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.950
posed at the beginning
is, which one

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.430
is more effective in stopping
airborne transmission

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.910
of disease?

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:23.160
So you can see these two
factors do come in differently

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.850
in the equations.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:28.350
So let's first consider
the effect our filtration--

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.390
effective air filtration.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.130
So there's a lot
of interest today

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.850
in installing Hepa filters or
other high quality filtration

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:45.710
systems into vulnerable spaces,
such as nursing homes, and also

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.010
in spaces such as classrooms,
where people fear transmission

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.490
of COVID-19.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.910
So we can ask how
effective that can be.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.730
So one way look at that
would be to say, well,

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:01.130
how does air filtration affect
the steady transmission rate?

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.980
So that would be looking
at the transmission rate

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.770
with the filter compared
to the transmission

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.970
rate without the filter.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.310
So if we do that, you can
see all the terms here

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.010
cancel except for this
one that has Pf in it.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.770
And so what we're left with
is, because in the denominator

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.540
we're left with just--

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.730
when Pf is equal to
0, it's just lambda a.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.370
That's in the denominator, so
it ends up in the numerator.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:34.920
And so it's just lambda a over
lambda a plus Pf lambda f.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.650
So the benefit of filtration
can be immediately seen right here.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.500
If you know the ratio
lambda a to lambda v,

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.460
because I can also
write this as 1 plus--

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.710
well, actually, I won't even--

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:47.790
I won't do that right now.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.490
But you can see how
this is related.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.160
It's related to this quantity
Z. but basically, the ratio

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.470
of the lambda a to
lambda v is related to Z.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.850
And that obviously
comes in here.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.590
And Pf comes in as well.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.180
But an interesting
question we can ask

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.010
is, well, what if you
have a perfect filter?

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.260
So let's say we have something
even better than Hepa.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.300
Let's say it's 100% filtration.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.440
That's like best case scenario.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:14.640
So this fraction here is larger
than if I just set Pf equals 1.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.400
So this is a perfect filter.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.050
So we have the most expensive
filter on the planet,

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.520
and it's going to definitely
filter everything.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.050
And so what we're
left with, then,

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.620
is just lambda a over
lambda a plus lambda f.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.480
Now I can make the
connection here.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:37.150
That is simply Z. So basically,
the effect of air filtration

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.630
is never better than the
outdoor air fraction itself.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.210
But I already told you, the
outdoor air fraction here

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.540
cannot be too small or you're
not delivering enough oxygen

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.860
to the occupants of the room.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.180
So basically, there are
standards for that as well.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:56.750
For example, you need to
have, for outdoor air,

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.330
there is an additional
requirement is that you need,

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.880
at least in the United
States, 15 cubic feet

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.220
per minute per person.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.660
So basically, this Q
can't be too small,

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.620
because you have to be
delivering, essentially,

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.330
enough oxygen for a
person to breathe.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.520
And so this is one way
this standard is decided.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.980
And so basically, the
Z can't be that small.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.940
And so if I ask myself, what's
the effect of filtration,

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.640
an interesting conclusion
to this calculation

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.650
is that this is not really
smaller than about 10

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:33.700
to the minus 1.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.910
So if we just think of an order
of magnitude, roughly speaking,

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.270
gaining a factor of 10,
maybe, out of air filtration,

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.470
but not that much more.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.180
Now, you might say,
how is that possible?

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.040
My filter is a perfect filter.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.900
I'm filtering everything.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.560
The problem is seen right
here, is that in reality,

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.910
what we really want is we
want to protect a person who's

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.490
over here, maybe
who is susceptible,

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.420
from another person over
here who is infected.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.630
And you see the problem is
that if it's a well-mixed room,

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.570
then the infected
person is breathing

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.260
all these infectious
droplets everywhere.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.040
And this other person
is breathing them.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.060
And even if you perfectly filter
the piece of the flow rate

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.740
that is going
through the filter,

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.840
there's still lots of
other air in the room

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.180
and it's not all being removed.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.280
So unfortunately, you
don't get such a benefit

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.870
from that, unless
you could completely

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.600
choke off the outdoor air
and just keep recirculating

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.000
until you remove all the virus.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.080
But then a problem is, you
also run out of oxygen,

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.360
and you don't have very
good air in the room.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.100
So that's not really
a solution either.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.890
So basically, air
filtration is helpful,

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.270
but I would say it's
not super helpful.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.600
A factor of 10 is good,
we like factors of 10.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.460
But it's not a factor of 100.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.430
And we might actually
rather have a factor of 100.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:57.510
So then we can ask ourselves,
well, what do we get from masks

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.290
And by this, I mean
everybody's wearing a mask.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.360
So keep in mind,
we never know who's

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.590
the infected person
ahead of time.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.170
So we want to
consider a case where

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.550
everybody's wearing a mask.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.650
And so then by assumption,
the infected person

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.780
is wearing a mask, and
any susceptible person

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.980
is also wearing a mask.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.600
So that's our assumption here.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.100
OK, so this is good
mask compliance here.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.520
And so we can ask
ourselves again,

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.490
what is the transmission
rate with mask

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:27.740
compared to the transmission
rate when there are no masks?

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.630
And the way my
notation works here,

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.320
Pm is the mask
penetration factor.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.320
So that would actually--

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.700
Pm equals 1, actually.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.500
That would be the case where,
basically, there is no mask,

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.040
because all the airflow
goes in and out of the mouth

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.260
without any kind of filtration.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.740
So this is just Pm squared.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.220
And the important thing
is that it's squared.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:55.500
So one argument you will hear,
which even influenced the World

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.240
Health Organization
back in January

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.250
at the beginning
of the pandemic,

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.920
is that the virus is so small,
as we've already discussed,

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:07.080
and probably is going to be
carried in very small droplets.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.320
And therefore, any
filtration, even a mask,

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.420
is not really that helpful,
because masks are not

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.940
going to be filtering at the
scale of 120 nanometers, which

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.070
is a virus.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.240
And even the smallest aerosol
droplets, many of them

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.500
do get through.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.770
In fact, when you get to
about 1/10 of a micron,

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:27.000
or 100 nanometers,
most mask materials

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.320
don't have good filtration.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.850
The very simple
reason is they also

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:31.320
have to allow good airflow.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.780
So if you have such tiny pores
that you're catching things

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.280
at that scale, the problem is
there's a very high resistance

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.650
to flow and you can't breathe.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.150
In fact, you've
probably experienced

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.860
that if you're wearing a good
mask that you can't wear it

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.320
for too long,
because after a while

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.740
you can't breathe anymore.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.680
So you need to have some big
enough pores to allow flow.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.310
And that makes it really hard to
filter the smallest particles.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.950
But the interesting thing is
this thing comes in squared.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:57.420
So we can ask ourselves, well,
what about different qualities

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.170
of masks?

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:01.650
So a really good mask material
that is perfectly fitting,

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.040
so like a high quality
surgical or N95 mask,

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.710
if you don't have
any leakage of air,

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.430
you have a really good fit,
and you're just going right

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.170
through the material,
this could be

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:15.940
as high as 99% filtration for
aerosols, for the aerosols

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:16.740
that we care about.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.220
And this would be like a high
quality surgical mask material,

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.040
like not even
factoring for the fit.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.860
So if it's 99% filtration,
what that means is Pm is 0.01,

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.100
but it comes in squared.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.890
And so this factor is
actually 10 to the minus 4.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.420
Four orders of
magnitude compared

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.500
to one order of magnitude
you get from the filter.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.140
Now, that's for perfect
masks, really good masks.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.480
What if our mask is not so good?

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.300
So actually, we have an N95.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.590
N95 actually is guaranteed
to filter about 95%

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:54.950
of the aerosols.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:58.900
And so if you take
0.05 and square it,

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.270
you're getting a number
of order 10 to the minus 3

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.480
for Pm squared.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.210
And what about cloth masks?

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.270
So this is where
the debate comes in,

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:12.349
because these days people are
wearing cloth masks, which

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:13.310
makes a lot of sense.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.290
It's way better than nothing,
as we'll see in a moment.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.960
But yeah, one could argue,
well, a lot of the cloth masks

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.960
might be letting through
these aerosol droplets.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.210
They're not really that great.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.200
In fact, if you look
at the cloth masks,

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.500
they could give you a range,
but it might be anywhere from--

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.020
I mean a really bad
cloth mask is 10%.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.820
That'd be like just a single,
thin, cotton, very loose weave,

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.350
like on a bandana.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.800
That's pretty bad.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.920
But most of the multi-layer
cloth masks, or the silk masks,

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.320
they can actually
do pretty well.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.050
They can even get as high as
90%, which is pretty high,

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:46.160
but it's possible.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.990
And maybe a lot of
them, depending on maybe

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:50.190
they're not fitting so well,
they might be more like,

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.800
let's say, 50%.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.800
But the thing is,
this comes in squared.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:00.350
And interestingly, even
the 90% case, that's 10%

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.170
get through, so Pm is 10%.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:07.580
But when you square 10%,
it's still 10 to the minus 2.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.280
And if you take these lower
numbers and square them,

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.780
you're still talking
about something

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:15.410
which is on the order
of 10 to the minus 1.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.600
So what this calculation
tells you is that even

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.320
like some of the worst
masks you can wear,

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.320
as long as there's good
compliance and everybody

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.010
is actually wearing
those masks indoors,

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.080
then the fact that
this comes in squared

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.600
means that you get
at least a factor

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.520
of 10 reduction in
the transmission

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.520
compared to having no
masks in a well-mixed room.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.700
And in fact, decent
masks will do way better.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:42.020
You could get a factor of 100,
1,000, or potentially 10,000

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.720
in reducing the transmission
rate by wearing masks,

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.670
whereas with filtration,
even with the most

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:48.260
expensive and highest
quality filters,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.700
you can barely get better
than a factor of 10.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.100
So this is a really important
concept to keep in mind.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.950
And it comes out of a
really simple calculation.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.880
And the simple reason
that I mentioned before

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.730
is that air filtration is only
filtering part of the air,

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:04.280
and the rest is just out
there for you to breathe.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:10.820
But masks are much better
because they capture the source

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.040
and they also block the target.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.440
So that basically,
every droplet has

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.850
to go through the
mask on one end

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.220
and it has to go through
it again on the other end.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.470
Whereas the filter is
missing most of the droplets.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:22.850
They're floating
around the room.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.440
They're not going
through the filter.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.480
Unless you choke off the outdoor
air, and you can't do that.
