00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.430
JULIAN BEINART: It's going to
be a strange new rhythm, not

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.970
turning up here on Tuesdays
and Thursdays endlessly.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.220
It's been an incredible saga.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.560
We have a minute,
because Thursday will not

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.170
be a good time for doing it.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.470
I'd like to spend five minutes
or 10 minutes with you.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.920
I can't ask for advice as
to how to do it better.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.430
Thank God I won't have to.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.470
But I'd be interested
in your general comments

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.460
about what we tried to do.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.370
I'd like to pass it on, too.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.340
Since 1956, this class has
been taught every year.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.045
That's 44-- 57 years.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.280
After 57 years, it should
be retired, which it is.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.670
Whether it will continue
in any form or another

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.590
is not up to me.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.100
There's a rule, thank God,
where that if you retire,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.170
your successors are independent.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.910
They have to bear the burden
of their predecessors.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.050
And fortunately,
this class will be

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.380
recorded for archival
purposes, so they

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.375
won't be able to get
rid of me that easily.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.980
Let's just spend a
few minutes having

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:26.020
a little discussion about
this enormous problematic area

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.450
dealing with the non-European,
non-American world,

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.000
and non-selective Asian world.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.880
It's called, in some terms,
the developing world.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.090
Now, the new name for
it is the Global South.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.700
That is the term which has
been appropriated by the newest

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.870
attempt to galvanize
international and professional

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.435
interest in an apparently
new way of doing things.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:16.410
You must recall that I said
that 1950 was the first time

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.820
a book in English--

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.920
and probably in any language--

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.310
appeared on the subject
of the so-called world

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.640
of international poverty.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.750
This was not Freidrich Engels
writing about Manchester,

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.420
or what could be seen
as its equivalent.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.660
But Charlie Abrams at MIT was a
lawyer who had worked in India,

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.780
and decided to come back
here and write about it.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.960
He was a New Yorker writing
about the emerging problems

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.805
of population
growth and poverty.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.660
It's curious that
when looking back

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:14.770
on the situation in
Manchester in 1830,

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:21.070
when the young German could
write about and analyze

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:29.560
the industrial poverty, that
the sudden leap of economy

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:38.710
had taken in Great Britain only
since some 80 years before,

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.000
if we count 1750 as
the beginning date.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.730
Engels and Marx were--

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.810
Engels particularly was
dissatisfied with the pace

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.710
of recalibration in England.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.160
He dismissed the moves
of the Chartist Group

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.280
as being ineffective.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.610
The British move first
through charity, then

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.300
through the state
and the nation,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.220
paying attention to what
is called social housing.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.540
It was definitive.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.140
It was the first
nation in the world

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.050
to tackle this problem
systematically-- not

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.430
systematically.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.410
Partially.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.540
But had Engels waited around
in England until today,

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.830
he might have seen that it
had measures of success,

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.880
despite Maggie
Thatcher's involvement

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.730
in the interim over a period.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.570
And keep on remembering
that the British are

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.370
slow but determined.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.590
I quoted sir Joseph Paxton,
the builder of the Crystal

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:09.340
Palace, the gardener
who said, we do things

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.830
by common sense and technology.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.220
Almost everything
was commonsensical,

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:23.700
and even in regard to
science and the development

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.500
of massive waves of
technological innovation

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.480
the world had ever seen.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:37.200
Above all, I remind
you that what happened

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:44.780
was the first destruction of
the Malthusian trap, which

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.960
is fundamental.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.830
As urbanists, you
should remember

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.840
as one of the key factors
in human development.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.880
In my little talk on Friday,
I'll start with, I think,

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.780
the first, and
that's the increase

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:12.910
in human brain size from 400
cubic centimeters to 1,450,

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.610
and what caused that.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.840
The Malthusian trap,
you will recall,

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:26.240
equated population
growth with death.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.620
The stable size of
population was all

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:38.580
that agricultural innovation
could supply, or could

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.680
forestall.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.600
And the sudden capacity
to unleash a population

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:54.660
to move relatively freely
with the advent of the larger

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.920
migration patterns that I
think that we see now, where--

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.810
anyway.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.410
London became the
largest city in the world

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.635
in a very quick manner.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.560
We're not lecturing
about London,

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.320
although it's tempting
to recall London.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.475
Such a great story.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:32.299
Engles took to the road.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:35.909
He and Marx were
in Paris in 1848.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:41.700
And then Engels spiriting
himself all over Europe,

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:49.530
nurturing, evolving Marxism,
until eventually, of course,

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:58.310
after his death, Russia
succeeded in attempting

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.550
to transform the world.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.690
That transformation
was built on the image

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:06.800
of industrial poverty.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.640
No advertisement--
I mean, the book

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:21.620
Sotsgorod, written by
Milyutin, the Russian architect

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.980
and bureaucrat, starts
off with a photograph

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.970
of the industrial city,
smoke belching out of pipes,

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.820
workers disenfranchised.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.640
I can't think of
anything else that

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:48.575
forced the publicity of the
attempt to nationalize poverty.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:03.410
The story of the so-called
third world is different.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.070
The battle against
poverty in Europe

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:16.780
was on the basis of a
history of development.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.265
There are very poor
people in Vienna today.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:30.640
Vienna, since the liberals took
over from the royalty in 1870,

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:39.250
1860s, went through various
exercises, including the rabid,

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:44.020
the rampant, period of Red
Vienna in the 1920s after

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:51.220
the '14-'18 war, which
produced the Karl Marx-Hof,

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.010
Matteotti-Hof.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:59.860
It's interesting that the
reaction of the major cities

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.040
that we looked at,
the five major cities,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.920
each produced a
specific housing type.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.950
London produced the
residential square.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:14.430
Paris produced the boulevard
house, the Haussmannian

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:15.990
boulevard house.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:21.180
Vienna produced the [INAUDIBLE],,
the first large palace-like

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.725
condominium building,
and the hof.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.000
Barcelona produced
the square block

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.080
of Cerda and the Ensanche.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.430
So it's extraordinary
that every major attempt

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.550
to reformulate the
form of the city

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:45.045
produces a new housing
type in its wake.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:54.060
Chicago-- I don't
know what it did.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.750
Chicago probably didn't
produce a housing type.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:05.140
The genesis of the
American suburban house

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:11.775
is old and starts with
the British conquest.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.570
So [INAUDIBLE] we
switch back and then

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:25.760
analogically to the
condition of poverty

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.580
in the developing world.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.660
Of all the demonstrations of
international cooperation,

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:43.900
I argued that the Olympic
Games stands out as the most

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:47.350
regular and beneficent.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:51.340
Nobody objects to
the Olympic games.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.260
They should have in
'36, but they didn't.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.020
Certainly, the Americans didn't.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:10.710
The Olympic Games has been held,
in all of its years since 1896,

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:15.690
only once in a city in which
the majority of people are poor.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.700
That's Mexico.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:23.360
It's 1968.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.180
The funding of the
Olympic Games is either

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:31.530
in favor of a national
economic gain,

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:37.290
advertising yourself on the
international economic platform

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:42.810
or, at best, gratifying
a national impulse

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:49.440
to be worldly and international
and, even more at best,

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.750
to satisfy perhaps a plangent
ambition in all of us

00:13:54.750 --> 00:14:00.800
to be part of a good world,
which is seldom available,

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.390
where people run in
peace against each other

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:11.330
as they did in 1896 in Athens.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.210
But the options for the
developing world are few,

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:19.370
because of two meta-conditions--

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:28.540
first of all, the
residue of colonialism

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:35.320
and the emancipation of wealth
from sources such as Mexico,

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:40.210
from sources such as India
through the cotton trade,

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:48.010
from almost every African
country, gold and diamonds

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:55.460
and uranium from South
Africa; secondly,

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.640
particularly in Africa,
the incipient tradition

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.960
of tribalism.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:09.480
Tribes were-- the world
was born in Africa.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:19.640
The first species of protohuman
was discovered 1,000 miles

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.340
from where I was born.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:30.540
So I'm one of the ancestors,
Australopithecus africanus--

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.490
that's 400 million years ago.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.490
Cities have only been
going for 20,000.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:43.410
What fraction of 400
million is 20,000?

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.990
It's a tiny percentage.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:49.600
Could somebody calculate it?

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.158
20,000 out of 400 million--

00:15:54.158 --> 00:15:54.825
what percentage?

00:15:54.825 --> 00:15:57.994
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
is one in 200.

00:15:57.994 --> 00:15:58.770
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:58.770 --> 00:15:59.770
JULIAN BEINART: It's 5%.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.120
AUDIENCE: 0.5%.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.960
JULIAN BEINART: 0.5%.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.460
Yeah.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.700
I conclude from
that we've not even

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.570
started sorting out urbanism.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:13.920
We've got a long way to go.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.010
That should satisfy all of
you who are young enough

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.220
to rejoice in the finding.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.120
Tribalism is difficult--

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.730
AUDIENCE: How much do
you think that urbanism

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.628
will attain a sort of
maturity or homeostasis

00:16:38.628 --> 00:16:40.420
because of the population
rather than time?

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:46.490
JULIAN BEINART: Population
projection is uncertain.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:51.620
I'm going to read you a number
of quotes from various sources

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.990
about this phenomenon.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:17:01.982
The one that I find
most dramatic touches

00:17:01.982 --> 00:17:03.065
on what you've just asked.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.660
"Urbanization in
developing countries

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.770
may be the single greatest
change in this century.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.950
It is projected that developing
countries will triple

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:28.160
their built-up urban area
between 2000 and 2030

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:34.490
from 200,000 square kilometers
to 600,000 square kilometers.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:38.570
These added 400 square
kilometers constructed

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:42.830
in just 30 years equal the
world's built-up urban area

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.176
in 2000.

00:17:45.176 --> 00:17:48.500
One could say humans are
building a whole new world

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:53.090
at about 10 times the speed in
countries with severe resource

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.170
constraints--

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:58.735
natural, fiscal,
administrative, and technical."

00:17:58.735 --> 00:18:05.640
Now, if this is correct,
it's impossible.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.000
Even China cannot
build at this speed,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.990
nor does the developing
world, by its nature,

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.410
have all of the
resources to do it.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.090
Slum population in the
world is expected--

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:31.920
is now stated at
about 1 billion people

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.540
and is stated to double
within the next 25 years.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:51.080
Let me just-- perhaps I
should have gone through some

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.100
of this material with you.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.280
I always forget.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.380
The world's largest
cities is one

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:25.660
of the indices of not very much
other than population size.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:30.580
New York was the largest
city in the world in 1950.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.290
It's now sixth.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.980
That's in the year 2000.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:40.120
Of course, this is assuming
that these measurements

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.010
are constant.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.440
What constitutes New
York I don't know.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.170
As far as the standard
metropolitan area,

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:54.440
I don't know how that
compares to Kolkata's area.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.970
But you can see the major
European cities, New York,

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:13.750
London, Rhine-Ruhr,
Paris, Chicago,

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:21.340
have diminished in relative
size as the growth of cities has

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:25.030
taken place in Latin
America and Asia--

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:28.720
not yet significantly
in Africa--

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.250
certainly very large cities.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.750
The second two pages are just
cuttings from newspapers.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:55.320
We saw John Snow's
1854 discovery

00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:00.540
that cholera was waterborne
and not miasmic in nature.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:05.490
Here you see cholera now
being used as an index

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:10.650
to determine 19th
century conditions.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.560
Feeding on 19th century
conditions cholera,

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.511
spreads in Latin America.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:24.050
Another phenomenon from this
world, "A Lovely Madness--

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:27.920
Argentina Builds New
Capital in Patagonia."

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.980
They didn't build the
capital, but they proposed

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.920
building a new capital.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:43.410
One of the urbanistic outcomes
of large population growth

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:46.470
and independence
has been the notion

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:51.300
that you need to establish your
status through the building

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.060
of a new capital.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:00.170
These have become famous
icons in the world--

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:10.030
Brasilia, par excellence,
but less significantly,

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:14.560
Chandigarh, in the
Punjab, after the division

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:20.130
between Pakistan and India left
the Punjab without a capital.

00:22:22.835 --> 00:22:23.933
AUDIENCE: Islamabad.

00:22:23.933 --> 00:22:24.850
JULIAN BEINART: Sorry?

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.580
AUDIENCE: Islamabad in Pakistan.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.220
JULIAN BEINART: Islamabad
in Pakistan, yes--

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:34.320
but the Indian part of
what remains of the Punjab.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:44.080
I did some work on Chandigarh
with Charles Correa.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:50.620
We published a piece in a
book we edited on Chandigarh,

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.225
published in India in English.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:58.630
The story of
Chandigarh is very much

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:05.290
the story of trying to
find an appropriate form

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:10.570
for a post-colonial
post-native city.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.640
Gandhi didn't leave
any instructions

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.676
on how to build cities.

00:23:18.676 --> 00:23:21.260
Neither did Marx.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:26.540
The great minds of social
change didn't take cities

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.950
into account.

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:31.850
Nor Sydney were they
building belaboring questions

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:34.130
of architectural form--

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:38.650
they were too busy
doing other things.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:47.440
Chandigarh emerged as a
complex mindset somewhere

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:56.650
between Indian leaders imagining
India to be on a progress

00:23:56.650 --> 00:24:01.330
transect towards modernism.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:05.890
There, after all, were few
Indian architects old enough

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:10.960
to be practicing
significantly at the time.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.590
They chose British
architects, who

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:18.170
in turn said they weren't
capable of doing the work

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.790
and recommended a French
architect by the name of Le

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:27.880
Corbusier, who came to
India, traveled around India,

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:33.880
and decided on a
sectoral plan, which

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.980
he had played with in Bogota
before coming to India,

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:43.630
without telling
anybody, and evolved

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:52.570
a plan which is based on a
series of five highway systems,

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:56.540
although there were no
cars in India at the time.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:01.060
I checked on the car
population of India in 1950.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:06.805
It was close to zero, except
for a few thousand cars.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:20.710
Chandigarh also didn't
look into the future

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:28.930
as far as how people would
develop from a designed point.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:38.170
First of all, we have
no way of dealing yet

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:41.780
with immigration as a result
of building an economic growth

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.280
point.

00:25:44.962 --> 00:25:48.550
There's an informal
sector of Chandigarh--

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:52.420
both in Chandigarh and in
the neighboring towns--

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.400
which outnumbers Chandigarh now.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.335
Land control is weak.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:08.270
Although the national government
superintends over Chandigarh,

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:14.080
it sells land illegally
north of the Capitol Complex

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.340
and in parts of the famous
drawings of Corbusier

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.605
in the Himalayas
in the distance.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.480
I can go on at length
about Chandigarh.

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:35.130
There is no attempt to look at
the genius of Indian urbanism,

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.440
native Indian urbanism.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.760
Nobody looked at Jaipur and
tried to make sense of Jaipur.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.690
Everything was to be, in
the grasp of modernism,

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:48.360
a modern project.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.870
At least Louis Kahn, when
he went to build in Dhaka,

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:57.380
looked at the way bricklayers
laid bricks and built

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:02.430
horizontal stripes in
relation to the terraces that

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:03.890
were finished each day.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:17.850
Chandigarh is now a center which
is historic in nature, much

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:23.550
like an Italian hill town, and
a periphery, which is a chaotic,

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:24.360
apparently.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:31.560
It's two cities--
the one envisioned

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:40.890
by a single man and
his cousin, the other

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:47.760
built by the free will allowed.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:53.250
Some of Corbusier's
regulations still stand today.

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:58.320
They are meaningless in
relation to a bicycle shack

00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.490
on the periphery.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:07.280
Anyway, that's so
much for Chandigarh.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:14.390
Chandigarh will stand as an
emblem of India's attempt

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:17.450
to calibrate itself.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:21.080
And in that sense, one
should feel proud of it.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.030
It could have been better.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:27.020
A generation later,
some Indian architects

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.390
would have done the same thing.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.140
There are buildings
that are going

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.360
to stand for a long time--

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:39.240
the law courts, for instance--

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:46.360
whereas the governor's palace
was never built, leaving the--

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:50.870
oh, I'm getting into
too much detail.

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:55.040
You know Chandigarh, or
you should know it well.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:12.870
Next page is the page of
optimism from a Toronto

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:16.290
newspaper arguing
that things are

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:17.790
going very well in the world--

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:31.810
sharing graphs of decline in
warfare; falling fertility--

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:42.380
not in the poorest countries,
but in inhabited countries;

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:45.932
change in life expectancy
rising everywhere--

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:55.800
sub-Saharan Africa,
they're still under 50;

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.830
the environment shows an
enormous drop in the production

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:01.300
of chlorofluorocarbons.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:18.360
At best, the Third
World does fairly well--

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:22.210
and so on.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.055
Next page gives a
projected number

00:30:32.055 --> 00:30:35.430
of slum dwellers by region.

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:51.390
Next page shows projections
for world population--

00:30:51.390 --> 00:31:03.960
population growth losing
25% in Eastern Europe.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.020
As you go from east
to west in Europe,

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:12.140
population growth
loses drastically

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:17.320
to the time we get to England,
where it's relatively stable--

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:23.970
Northern Europe, Western
Europe losing 0.2%.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:31.370
At the same time, the major
population growth in the United

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:38.210
States, plus 33%, is
due to migration more

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:41.840
than anything else.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:48.030
The worst conditions are in
Western Africa, plus 127%--

00:31:48.030 --> 00:32:01.530
122%; middle Africa, plus 175%;
South Central Asia, plus 55%;

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:08.475
Western Asia, plus
79%; Japan, minus 17%.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.190
People migrate to cities
because there's a better chance

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.030
in life than where they are.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:26.200
They're not dumb.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.550
The notion that people are
animals and behave foolishly

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:34.600
in going to cities is
a foolish proposition.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.070
The life lottery
is large in cities.

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:41.770
It's always been that way.

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:45.860
Your daughter can go to
school and marry a rich man.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:49.900
It's unlikely to
happen in a village.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.170
There's a sanctity numbers
which you cannot deny.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:03.880
Number two-- staying in the
rural areas is no blessing.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:09.400
If only the rural areas is what
our romantic vision of nature

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.470
suggests--

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:17.710
beautiful landscape,
low involvement in work,

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:23.050
sitting on the porch,
drinking rum at sundown,

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.960
all images from the
colonial tourist world.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:33.490
I grew up in South Africa
with Afrikaans literature

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:36.490
being filled with
images of this kind--

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:41.200
farmers sitting
benightedly on their porch

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:45.430
whilst their black laborers
slaved away in the distance.

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:50.740
And the young daughter
who'd gone to the city

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:53.930
comes back with an
illegitimate child,

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:57.010
and they all mourn the
fact that the country's

00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:00.401
been going to the dogs.

00:34:00.401 --> 00:34:02.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:12.940
There's no real-- much
though even the Russians

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:20.290
and many ideologies
sanctified the country as well

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:22.150
as the city.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:24.699
The Communist
Manifesto says, develop

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:27.429
the country and the city.

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:30.230
The fact is that nobody has
really effectively developed

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.730
the country.

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:37.969
The United States is
producing more food

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:41.290
on 7% of the
agricultural population

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:44.080
than it started with.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.010
And that's not the
correct statistic.

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:50.870
I haven't got the
statistic in front of me,

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.150
but it's something like that.

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:55.550
In South Africa since
apartheid, there's

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:59.450
been enormous
attempts to increase

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:03.110
the amount of agricultural
land owned by Black people.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:05.060
I think they still
own less than 20%.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:18.060
Brutal land reform, such as
by Mr. Mugabe in Rhodesia--

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:23.420
not Rhodesia,
Zimbabwe-- has produced

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.690
appalling economic results.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.990
We haven't found a
formula for making

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:37.070
the land productive
outside of heavy technology

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:43.850
or corporate production,
which the United States leads

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:44.630
the world in.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:55.840
There are signs of
migration from rural to city

00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:02.530
in India suggesting
that people do both--

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:05.440
have part of their
families in the country

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:10.405
and work in the city and migrate
selectively between them.

00:36:10.405 --> 00:36:15.130
These are an intelligent
form of migration.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:18.802
But it's not yet
considerably large.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:29.810
So whereas the British, by the
Enclosure of the Commons Act,

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:34.340
took land away from poor
people, forced them into cities,

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:37.760
today the process is that
nobody is taking the land away

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.430
from you, except there's
nothing to do on it.

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:49.640
Migration is not
a new phenomenon.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.130
We started off as migrants.

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:54.455
We settled after
400 million years--

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.968
took a long time to settle.

00:36:58.968 --> 00:37:00.402
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:09.600
We've only settled for
20,000 years, at best.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.870
But the rural parts of
the world are becoming

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:18.130
more desolate, less inhabited.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:23.200
The problem with Central Africa
and the highest migration rates

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.450
is a combination
of high fertility

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:29.920
rates and urbanization.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:34.960
You put the two together, and
you have a lethal combination.

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:41.290
AUDIENCE: Aren't there are also
factors of desertification,

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:43.762
desertification a lot
of agricultural land,

00:37:43.762 --> 00:37:46.760
and that's part
of that migration?

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:52.700
JULIAN BEINART: It
depends where you are.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:56.510
I mean, in Israel, agricultural
land is so valuable.

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:59.240
In Cuba, agricultural
is so valuable

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.670
because the territory
is so small.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:06.980
In this country, one flies over
agricultural land endlessly.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:10.190
And there's no pressure
of densification.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:11.373
AUDIENCE: Desertification.

00:38:11.373 --> 00:38:12.290
JULIAN BEINART: Sorry?

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:12.920
AUDIENCE: Desert.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.730
JULIAN BEINART: (LAUGHING) Oh,
sorry, I thought densification.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:15.255
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:15.255 --> 00:38:16.130
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:17.330
JULIAN BEINART: Oh, desert.

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:22.940
Yes, the enormous
ecological problems.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:27.060
Untended land tends
to get into no good

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.620
when it's been tended already.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:38.850
But ecologists know so
much more about this now.

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:41.820
The knowledge of what to
do about dammed rivers,

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:46.470
and undamming rivers,
letting them travel freely

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:49.515
is a major new
ecological thrust.

00:38:55.590 --> 00:39:08.480
Population growth is not held
to be a good religious thing.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.300
For the Catholics,
contraception is

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:16.790
forbidden as it tries to
convince the world that it

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:21.320
has an Argentinian
pope who's a man who

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.780
stood up against the military.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:26.012
I'm not sure about that, either.

00:39:26.012 --> 00:39:27.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:34.080
But whether that's true or
not, modern man though he is,

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.605
he still believes in
the sanctity of life.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:49.060
So a new world
must look to being

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.755
able to cope with
poverty at a mass scale--

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:58.070
urbanized poverty,
not rural poverty.

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:00.830
Although, rural poverty
will remain a phenomena.

00:40:03.554 --> 00:40:10.160
There are people who
will remain on the farm,

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.470
remain in small villages.

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:15.440
But they won't be a significant
part of the population.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.730
That's the sad part.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:31.100
I'm just going to read you a
few figures from these texts.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:38.020
The two best graphic texts
are the exhibition book

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:41.170
from the Cooper Hewitt
exhibition at the United

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:43.900
Nations last year.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.600
You should have
seen the exhibition.

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:51.460
I had a little bit
to do with it--

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:55.990
not saying so because
I want to be proud.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:59.890
And the book of the
Rockefeller Foundation,

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:02.020
Century of the City--

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.675
I refer to both of
these in your reading.

00:41:04.675 --> 00:41:08.800
They're the two best
recent publications.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.630
I'm just going to quote
here and there from them.

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:15.865
Many of them are amped
up about figures.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.690
"In a report on the
future economy of India,

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:29.470
Goldman Sachs projects
that 31 villagers

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:33.820
will continue to arrive in
an Indian city every minute

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.640
over the next 43 years--

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.890
700 million people in all."

00:41:42.166 --> 00:41:47.660
Now, how do you incubate
700 million people,

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:51.520
which is more than twice
the population of the United

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.670
States, over 43 years?

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:56.170
We'll see.

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:57.760
I won't be around to watch.

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:13.250
Joel Cohen of
Columbia University--

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:16.910
"The world will have to build
one city of one million people

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:21.470
every five days for
the next 42 years

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:25.040
to accommodate the massive
rural-to-city migration."

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:32.070
One city of one million
every five days--

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.590
a lot of work to do.

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:39.060
I'd be very happy
in your profession.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:46.710
You're going to be deluged by
professional responsibilities.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:02.950
It goes on to talk
about climate change.

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:06.010
60% of the world's
cities are within walking

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:07.270
distance of the sea.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:20.370
"The coastal provinces of China
experienced a net in-migration

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:22.950
of 17 million people
in just the five

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:28.080
years between 1995 and 2000.

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:32.115
African-- half of those
cities, including Lagos

00:43:32.115 --> 00:43:35.340
and [INAUDIBLE]"--"-- they've
shifted to Africa--

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:38.130
"are in the
low-elevation coastal.

00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:41.250
Much of Mumbai, India,
home to the largest slum

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:48.420
settlement in the world, is
built essentially on landfill--

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:52.050
city is a continuing target
for weather disasters."

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:00.810
We'll look, in a minute,
at a few positives.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:21.100
"Almost half the global
population lives on less than

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:24.490
$2.50 a day.

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:27.970
That is more than 3
billion people, almost all

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:31.230
in developing countries.

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:35.110
Even more shocking, the
proportion of people below

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:39.520
the $2.50 per day poverty
line has remained more or less

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:45.880
constant between 1981 and 2005.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.730
According to the World
Bank, the richest 20%

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:51.070
of the world's
population accounts

00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:54.250
for 76% of all consumption.

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:57.500
The bottom 40% account
for only 1.5%."

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:36.130
I want you to look at
some cases of optimism.

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:40.240
These are small
situations which have

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:47.260
improved through the energy
of workers themselves.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:52.300
Before that, this fits
into the new paradigm,

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:58.330
which has emerged over the last
few years, in which theorists

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:01.300
of developing
countries and activists

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:05.980
have argued that the only
resource that people have

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:11.830
is themselves, that what we
call sweat equity or human labor

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:18.610
or adapted human intelligence
is all that people have.

00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:22.420
So international organizations,
like Slum Dwellers

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:25.960
International or the
various regional branches

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:33.520
in India and in
Thailand and so on

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:38.170
have the ambition to
not sit around and wait

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:44.530
for charity or benevolent
dictatorship or any

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:47.890
of the other modalities,
but to harness,

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:54.670
to use their intelligence and
their capacity as human beings

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:56.190
to do something about it.

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:03.560
The problem with all of this--

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.427
yep?

00:47:04.427 --> 00:47:08.090
AUDIENCE: Can I read a
quote from [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:10.380
JULIAN BEINART:
Sorry, I can't hear.

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.960
AUDIENCE: Can I read a
quote from one of the papers

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.228
that I used for my paper--

00:47:14.228 --> 00:47:15.395
JULIAN BEINART: Yes, please.

00:47:15.395 --> 00:47:16.562
AUDIENCE: --that is related?

00:47:16.562 --> 00:47:18.470
JULIAN BEINART:
Please, somebody talk.

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:20.223
I'm tired of talking.

00:47:20.223 --> 00:47:24.790
AUDIENCE: OK, it is in
reference of the case

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:29.670
of the slum [INAUDIBLE]
in the South African Cape

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:31.018
Town, Khayelitsha.

00:47:31.018 --> 00:47:32.435
JULIAN BEINART:
Khayelitsha, yeah.

00:47:32.435 --> 00:47:33.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah, Khayelitsha.

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:39.864
So this person was the director
of development services.

00:47:39.864 --> 00:47:44.350
[INAUDIBLE] Talked
a little [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:45.680
this paper about the people.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.760
He says, talking in
reference [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:50.672
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah,
just read us the quote.

00:47:50.672 --> 00:47:51.820
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:54.160
"If we do not start
immediately with meeting

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.940
the local communities'
most urgent needs,

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:58.450
we are going to
lose our legitimacy

00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:00.400
as a public administration.

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.550
And if we do not do it in
the most participatory way

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:06.220
possible," and this is
the most important part,

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:09.400
"we will waste the most
important capital we have,

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.410
the dedication of
the people themselves

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.630
and their will for change."

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:15.280
JULIAN BEINART: Good.

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:20.500
I think one of the most
impressive examples so far has

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:26.140
been the 300,000-person
suburb of Sao Paulo,

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:32.710
17 kilometers from the center
of Sao Paulo, called Diadema.

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:35.290
Fortunately, they've
published a book called

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:38.650
Diadema and the Informal City.

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:40.870
I don't know-- I don't
think the library has

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:44.390
a copy of this book.

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:54.790
It's a detailed case study
of how Diadema went about

00:48:54.790 --> 00:49:01.350
from being one of the most
violent cities in Latin

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:04.970
America, having one of
the highest crime rates,

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:09.270
have having one of the
lowest educational rates,

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:17.020
being one of the worst slums
in Latin America, to being,

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:21.420
now, a town which
attracts industry,

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:24.300
has its first shopping mall.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:43.110
And it's a story of workers
galvanizing into groups,

00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:48.570
exhibiting their power in the
election of city officials,

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:54.060
forcing assistive procedure,
and to create in poor people

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:58.950
a sense of trust by making
things happen in a very

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:01.020
slow but deliberate way--

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:04.380
paving a street, for instance--

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:10.020
slowly building up in
its dimensions until it

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:15.390
can tackle major issues,
such as national financial

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:17.220
intervention.

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:21.910
They go back and forth with the
military over a period of time.

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:24.690
Then Lula gets
elected president.

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:26.700
He's very sympathetic.

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:34.170
And they have enough
evidence to show that they're

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:35.880
worth investing in.

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:41.370
And slowly, infant mortality
rates decline, all of this

00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:41.940
happens.

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:46.440
New housing is built.
Older housing is renewed.

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:50.360
People are part of
a process which--

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:57.140
there's teaching in
schools about crime.

00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:00.260
Guns are taken away at school.

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:03.950
I mean, a whole
network of things

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:08.450
happened which probably
characterize a good town.

00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:11.390
And they know they're
very proud of the fact

00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:16.250
that they've emerged from the
worst conditions of slumness,

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:21.170
slumhood, to being a--

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:25.550
along the way were
a couple of themes.

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:31.700
Trust-- poor people
don't easily have trust.

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:34.890
They've never been brought
up to trust anybody

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:42.090
except some intimate
relationship, if they're lucky.

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:44.880
They don't trust the government.

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:49.500
Our government bypasses
them almost completely.

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:54.280
They have no
prospects that anybody

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:57.250
is going to be able
to change the system.

00:51:57.250 --> 00:52:00.670
Slowly, the system does change.

00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:07.210
And a generation of people
grow up who start believing.

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:14.850
All of this is true in the
other case in the reading, which

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:22.320
I took because it's a man
who deals with housing

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:28.230
finance in Bangkok, who writes
very explicitly about how he

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:33.660
changed his method of working
by allowing people to take part

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:36.390
and using [INAUDIBLE],,
teaching people

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:39.630
how to deal with their money.

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:44.220
Learning how to deal with money
is something to be learned.

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:45.960
Nobody ever taught me.

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:47.160
I still don't know.

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:52.340
It's extraordinary.

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:54.320
You arrive in a modern world.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.540
You've got to buy a house.

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:59.000
Your parents were too old to--

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.881
uneducated to-- in
this kind of game.

00:53:03.881 --> 00:53:07.385
Where do you learn?

00:53:07.385 --> 00:53:10.916
Where is the social instruction?

00:53:10.916 --> 00:53:13.480
This is in a middle
class situation.

00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:19.570
When my son bought an
apartment in New York,

00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:24.030
he was lucky to have a
wife who is an accountant.

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:27.480
So he could remain
being a theorist

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:31.020
while his wife took care
of all the financial stuff.

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.930
It's a wonderful combination.

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:36.860
But not many people are lucky
to be married to accountants.

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:49.770
So that piece deals with
the enormous capacity

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:56.200
for microfinance to generate
both a sense of trust.

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.660
It's analogous to the
invention of the mortgage

00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:02.130
system in England in 1830.

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:06.640
The mortgage system took the
business of borrowing money

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:12.040
away from a crooked
landowner person, put it

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.590
in the hands of a bank.

00:54:14.590 --> 00:54:18.970
A bank may crook, but it
has to crook on a very much

00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:21.100
larger scale than you.

00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:31.100
And the mortgage
system enabled trust

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:34.520
in the purchase of
housing in a way

00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:37.030
that had never existed before.

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:40.280
You were always at the
behest of your landlord.

00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:47.620
You get these
stories of La Boheme

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:52.540
and La Traviata
in Paris, artists

00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:58.270
living in the top floor of
a Haussmann Boulevard house

00:54:58.270 --> 00:55:01.300
and the knock on
the door, saying

00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:04.540
haven't paid your rent
for the last few months.

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:06.075
What are you going to do?

00:55:06.075 --> 00:55:08.470
And you're starving
of tuberculosis.

00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:16.320
So that image is no longer
present, or not largely present

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.330
in the mortgage system.

00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:23.180
A microfinance system is
analogous to the mortgage

00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:26.370
system in the building of trust.

00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:33.660
98% of the loans engendered
in India in microfinance

00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:41.100
have been repaid, which is an
incredible statistic, given

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:48.630
the general condition of
poverty and the lawlessness

00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:50.500
that it insinuates.

00:55:53.260 --> 00:56:03.000
OK, the trouble with
seeing good things happen

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.010
is that sometimes
good things need

00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:07.800
to happen at a very large
scale for them really

00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:10.410
to make a big impact.

00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:16.510
Scaling up Diadema
is difficult. How

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:28.120
do you get the idea to occur
in Tanzania, or in the Congo,

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:28.690
in Darfur?

00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:35.580
But at least they
are a small model.

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:45.640
Now, maybe we will not
need massive international

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:52.150
cooperation to
generate new models.

00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:56.460
I despair, given
the track record

00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:06.430
of League of Nations, United
Nations, atomic energy,

00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:13.480
and climate carbon
control agreements.

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:24.330
As long as you
ask the poor world

00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:28.410
to subdue their economic
activity, industrial activity,

00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:33.450
on the grounds that they are
contributing to climate change,

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:36.630
they rightfully can point
to the United States

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:43.010
having built up its economy
through smoke and railroads

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:54.780
and now, being the largest
client for carbon production

00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:57.930
in the world, complaining.

00:57:57.930 --> 00:58:02.220
Even the United States wouldn't
sign the Kyoto Agreement,

00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:05.740
in Copenhagen got no further.

00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:16.110
So I leave you with optimism
and a kind of foreboding.

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:19.680
A combination of climate
change and poverty

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:23.530
is a disastrous combination.

00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:29.790
Its effects will be
particularly felt

00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:37.510
in water-borne cities like
Dhaka, in the Himalaya region.

00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:44.650
The Himalayas control very much
of the flood and drought cycles

00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:46.150
in the areas it reaches.

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:57.810
Wealth will be able to withstand
climate change, by and large.

00:58:57.810 --> 00:59:06.320
It will modify behavior, but
it will increase migration

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:09.170
pressure on the United
States and on Europe

00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:12.970
and on established countries.

00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:16.840
I don't think United
States television

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:19.630
could stand having
children floating

00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:26.160
in water in Bangladesh
without changing its migration

00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:28.140
attitude.

00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:34.710
Migration is now under
debate in this country.

00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:37.650
As a migrant, I
myself, of course

00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:39.270
I'm in favor of migration.

00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:44.120
Statistically, we have
built this country.

00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:50.940
There are more foreign-born
professors in this school

00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:53.520
than there are
Americans, I think.

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:56.114
I don't know.

00:59:56.114 --> 00:59:58.020
There'll be one less soon.

00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:00.220
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:06.190
These are all trajectories
for the long future,

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:08.410
but not so long.

01:00:08.410 --> 01:00:11.200
It's already 2013.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:17.680
Some of these
predictions are for 2030.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.630
And there's no respite
except for the people

01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:33.200
who believe that science has
no way of forecasting change.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.000
Anyway, these are dull topics.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.430
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:41.300
There's not much that you can
go out and do about it except

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:44.540
buy yourself a hybrid
car and eat green.

01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:56.530
The trouble with climate
change-- it's too invisible.

01:00:56.530 --> 01:00:59.800
It's not dramatic enough to
stir the public conscience.

01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:07.850
You think of the
German Holocaust.

01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:12.230
In 1936, when Berlin
had the Olympic Games,

01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:15.350
there were concentration
camps within miles,

01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:19.950
on the outskirts of Berlin.

01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:24.030
Avery Brundage, the leader
of the American delegation,

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:27.990
castigated New York Jews
in The New York Times

01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:29.910
for making a story of it.

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.810
The United States
refused to take

01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:43.430
in a boat of people fleeing the
Holocaust because they weren't

01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:48.320
legal citizens, and
so on and so on.

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.510
The demonstration
of the Holocaust

01:01:50.510 --> 01:02:02.920
over 10 years of visibility was
neglected by almost everybody.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:09.760
I don't have much trust in
the universal consciousness.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.450
The world doesn't
have any conscience.

01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:16.420
It only has selective
consciousness,

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:21.580
often in service of private
good and national good.

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:24.940
The more Boston goes
on about being strong,

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:30.070
the more I read a kind of
perverse nationalism creeping

01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:31.960
in--

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:37.090
again, identifying yourself
as able to be a Goliath

01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:41.560
withstanding the treachery
of two young men.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.090
Anyway, these are my
personal positions.

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:55.398
I don't know what you
think about your future.

01:02:55.398 --> 01:03:02.770
[LAUGHS] I grew up with the
advantage of being a modernist.

01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:06.330
And the world was
very attractive--

01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:11.290
if only we could slay all
those 19th century devils.

01:03:11.290 --> 01:03:14.290
It's amazing to
me to know that--

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:19.330
to think that I studied
modern architectural history

01:03:19.330 --> 01:03:23.020
with Sigfried
Giedion at Harvard.

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:27.430
In Giedion, in all of
his teaching to us--

01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:31.130
after all, he wrote Space,
Time and Architecture, which

01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:32.710
was a big book at my day--

01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:41.210
Giedion only referred to
the terrible ruling tastes

01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:44.930
of the 19th century,
that it wasn't producing

01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:47.630
architects of any consequence.

01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:54.710
He never mentioned
anything to do with a city,

01:03:54.710 --> 01:04:00.050
not in all of his evocation,
class after class of modernism.

01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:07.090
He'd said, oh, it's attractive
that we've grown up.

01:04:12.161 --> 01:04:15.270
At least I think we've grown up.

01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:19.450
We're beginning to grow up.

01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:24.370
We talk about architecture being
inseparable from urbanism now.

01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:29.310
And yet we don't teach
urban history at all.

01:04:29.310 --> 01:04:31.530
This is the closest
class you're going to get

01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:34.200
to dealing with urban history.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:41.250
And I know a historian,
and he uses a sneaky method

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:42.720
to introduce history.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:45.210
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:49.920
Not being sure of the
detailed facts myself,

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:57.090
I have to conjure up clever,
tricky ways of convincing you.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.610
There's no
architecture curriculum

01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:07.050
in the world that doesn't
require architectural history

01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:10.020
as a major element
of its discourse.

01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:16.610
There's no field in the arts--

01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:20.900
literature, painting,
music-- that

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:25.290
doesn't require an understanding
of its predecessors.

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.350
You can play the horn
as much as you want to,

01:05:30.350 --> 01:05:35.030
but you better know Mozart,
or at least one symphony

01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:39.470
of Mozart, in your exams.

01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:41.600
You can be an
architectural graduate

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:47.120
with not knowing one
city plan in history.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.080
City plans are
difficult to remember,

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.490
and I wouldn't want to
be given an exam asking

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:55.940
me to draw 10 city plans.

01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:57.260
Chandigarh is easy.

01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:59.990
Manhattan is easy.

01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:10.760
Once you depart-- anyway,
so go and finish your work.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.100
Have a great summer.

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:16.240
And I'll see you on Thursday
if you have the time.

01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:22.160
So much for the world of--

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.760
the developing-- Ricardo,
what do you think

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:27.666
is going to happen in Mexico?

01:06:27.666 --> 01:06:29.082
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

01:06:29.082 --> 01:06:30.500
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:33.410
JULIAN BEINART: No, in relation
to our general discussion

01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:34.272
this morning?

01:06:34.272 --> 01:06:36.230
AUDIENCE: I think there
was a lot of discussion

01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:37.250
around Mexico City.

01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:39.350
But I think that most
people tend to neglect

01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:44.880
what's happening in
mid-sized cities in Mexico--

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:48.830
so not necessarily places
like Monterrey or Guadalajara,

01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:53.540
but actually places like
Puebla, [INAUDIBLE],,

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:57.700
which are a big part of the
backbone of where Mexico lives,

01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:00.444
places like [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:00.444 --> 01:07:09.080
And they fear that they're
often thought of as basically

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.766
an afterthought.

01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:20.970
But you see cities there, like
Tijuana, like [INAUDIBLE],, who

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:24.870
are really experimenting
and pushing things forward,

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:27.300
for that population,
is very interesting--

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:29.830
not necessarily the following
the model of [INAUDIBLE]..

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:36.820
So it's interesting
that they are--

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.750
JULIAN BEINART: Is
there any movement

01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:41.910
that combines these efforts?

01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:42.540
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:45.780
Yeah, there are some programs.

01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:51.138
There are some programs by the
federal government [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:51.138 --> 01:07:55.450
urban sustainable development.

01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:58.480
And within each
city, there tends

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.630
to be a local grassroots
movements that

01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:04.778
are sort of pushing
the urban development.

01:08:04.778 --> 01:08:06.870
AUDIENCE: What is it mean?

01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:07.590
AUDIENCE: DUIS.

01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:10.278
It's easier if you
just look at DUIS.

01:08:10.278 --> 01:08:11.820
AUDIENCE: But what
does it stand for?

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:15.410
AUDIENCE: It's Wholly
Sustainable Urban Developments.

01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:17.761
AUDIENCE: Wholly Sustainable
Urban Development.

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:18.750
AUDIENCE: Wholly?

01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:21.231
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:08:21.231 --> 01:08:23.189
It's a program from the
federal government that

01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:26.193
finances housing [INAUDIBLE]
Mexico is building

01:08:26.193 --> 01:08:31.870
about 950,000 houses a year.

01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:37.319
So there is a lot
going on there.

01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:38.858
It's interesting
times down there,

01:08:38.858 --> 01:08:42.104
as in many places in
Latin America, actually.

01:08:45.439 --> 01:08:47.660
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:51.380
Well, let's hope.

01:08:55.844 --> 01:08:59.130
This class was not
to depress you.

01:08:59.130 --> 01:08:59.899
AUDIENCE: Sorry?

01:08:59.899 --> 01:09:01.649
JULIAN BEINART: I said,
this class was not

01:09:01.649 --> 01:09:03.827
designed to depress you.

01:09:03.827 --> 01:09:05.819
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:05.819 --> 01:09:11.279
On the contrary, you could
simply say, over 10,000 years,

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:17.250
we achieved achieve more
than 400 million before us.

01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:27.050
And there's many
benefits that have come

01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:30.680
from urbanization in our time.

01:09:34.979 --> 01:09:36.780
Maybe it will continue--

01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:40.760
but hopefully, less selectively
than it's been up to now.

01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:53.300
There's no law that asks
you to be a social animal.

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:57.290
You can't drive into
somebody else's garden

01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:59.630
and get away with it.

01:09:59.630 --> 01:10:04.170
But there's nothing
that requires

01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:10.050
you to see your own condition in
the light of other people less

01:10:10.050 --> 01:10:11.940
fortunate.

01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:14.580
Charity was invented
by the British.

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:18.160
Well, charity has
been with us forever.

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:21.810
But at the end of
the 19th century,

01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:28.510
charity was seen as the
major involvement of wealth.

01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:31.510
It still is in this country.

01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:36.890
I get upset every time
I get a phone call

01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:41.090
asking me to donate something
and trying to reconstruct

01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:46.700
my own ideology, which is not
in favor of charity at all,

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:52.095
but charity being only a method
of conceding the government's

01:10:52.095 --> 01:10:52.595
inaction.

01:10:59.010 --> 01:11:01.980
There's no-- I don't know.

01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:04.340
It's very complicated.

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:08.250
It's very fundamentally
complicated as to who was--

01:11:08.250 --> 01:11:16.410
why was I statistically
born to have enough money

01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:21.795
to come and study here and then
have enough energy to stay?

01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:26.670
I'll never be able to answer--

01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:32.070
as opposed to a child growing
up in the Congo today.

01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:37.110
What statistical right do
I have over that child?

01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:41.310
These are questions
philosophers have argued with.

01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:42.195
They may be tedious.

01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:52.040
But Marxism didn't
solve the problem.

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:58.190
Marxism only introduced
a new form of power,

01:11:58.190 --> 01:12:03.110
despite all of the
grassroots sentiments,

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:08.830
it didn't result in anything.

01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:11.620
OK, see you next week--

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:14.380
I'll see you later this week.
