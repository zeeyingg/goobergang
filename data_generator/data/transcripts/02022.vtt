00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.980
PROFESSOR: So now
that we understand

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.610
the types of droplets
that are emitted

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.730
by different types
of respiration,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.850
and their evolution
in the environment

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.190
as a function of humidity
and other factors.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.860
Let's talk about
the different ways

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.570
that transmission
can actually occur

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.490
between two individuals
of a respiratory pathogen.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.630
So the first is
contact transmission

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.230
through so-called fomites.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.760
These are residues of those
infectious droplets that

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.510
had been emitted by breathing,
which can build up on surfaces

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.600
such as tables, floors,
even on people's clothing,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.760
on their hands,
from the breathing

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.290
of an infected person.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.270
And then as a central
person touches

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.330
those surfaces and then
touches their eyes or touches

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.380
their nose.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.680
And in various ways gets
the pathogen into their body.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.019
So that is not likely to be the
dominant mode of transmission

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.170
for COVID-19, as the
evidence is building up

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.160
of other modes of transmission.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.310
Nevertheless, it is
still recommended

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.500
to be disinfecting
and washing surfaces

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.820
to protect against this
potential mode of transmission.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.600
Another mode of transmission is
through large ballistic drops.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.160
So these are the
droplets we talked

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.260
about at the beginning,
some of which

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.090
are large enough to
sediment to the ground.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.430
Others of which will
eventually settle,

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.890
but which can be
transferred by the momentum

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.950
of a cough, or a sneeze,
or some violent exhalatory

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.780
event to another person.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.210
And that other
person can directly

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.250
breathe in those droplets.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.380
So this is especially
important when dealing

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.690
with symptomatic individuals.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.180
On the other hand,
for COVID-19, it's

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.520
well established that the
majority of transmissions

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.360
are, in fact, asymptomatic.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.479
So people are not
coughing or sneezing,

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.450
and yet are still managing
to transmit this highly

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.120
infectious virus.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.920
Which brings us then
to the third mode

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.450
of transmission, which is
through aerosol droplets.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.199
These are the droplets
which do not settle quickly

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:12.130
on the timescale of occupancy
of the room, or a ventilation,

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.680
or other factors that
remove those droplets,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.810
such as deactivation.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.320
And those droplets are emitted
even in normal respiration/

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.160
normal breathing.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.020
So just simply the puffs
of breathing, speaking--

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.590
put those aerosol
droplets in the air

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.260
and then they're
carried by air currents

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.690
in the room, which we will
analyze in greater detail later

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.450
in this course, and
essentially fill the room.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.310
And as a first
approximation, those droplets

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.900
are spread throughout
the room, and is

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.110
a well mixed space of air.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.850
And within that
context, there are still

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.579
two modes of transmission
we can talk about.

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.730
If people are not wearing
any masks or face covering,

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.310
then those puffs
of respiration can

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.210
be directly impinging upon
a susceptible person, who

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.650
then can breathe them in.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.890
And those aerosols will be
at a higher concentration

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.190
than the background ambient
air of the well mixed room.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.510
And we refer to that
as short-range aerosol

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.280
transmission.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.300
And we will return to that in
the last part of the course.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.120
But what we're going
to focus on first

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.150
is long-range
airborne transmission.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.310
So these are the droplets
that end up in the air.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.890
They become well mixed
throughout the space.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.500
And anyone in the room,
even very far away,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.079
can breathe those droplets
in and, over time,

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:31.230
can inhale an infectious
dose and become infected.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.010
It's important to recognize
the role of face coverings,

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.740
especially in the context
of these respiratory

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.860
droplet transmission modes.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.410
So whether it's a
mask or a face shield,

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.230
those facial coverings
can essentially

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.079
eliminate short-range
aerosol transmission.

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.320
Of course, they also completely
eliminate large drop emission

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.820
because the droplets
don't make it

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.390
through those ballistic
protections if you will.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.190
And even the momentum generated
in the air from the breathing

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.290
is largely eliminated
by shields or masks.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.110
On the other hand, these
small aerosol droplets

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.190
can pass through masks.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.560
They certainly can pass
around face shields or even

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.670
plastic shields that you
see in various public spaces

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.740
these days.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.440
And those droplets then are
quickly spread around the room

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.070
and we're left with the
airborne mode of transmission.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.240
We will see later, there
is an important distinction

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.040
between a mask and
a shield, however.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.130
While both of them blocked
the momentum of the fluid that

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:38.659
leads to puffs and respiratory
jets and plumes of transfer,

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.240
they do provide, in
the case of the mask,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.630
additionally filtration,
which can actually

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.390
block many of the droplets--
not necessarily all,

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.710
but a significant fraction.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.990
And that will be
an important aspect

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.480
of understanding
how to make spaces

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.680
safe from airborne transmission.
