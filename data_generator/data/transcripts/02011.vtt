WEBVTT

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.940
PROFESSOR: So the transfer
of respiratory pathogens

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.970
is primarily accomplished
through droplets

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.880
that are emitted by
an infected person

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.740
and then either breathed
in or ending up on surfaces

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.880
and touched and incorporated
into the body in some other way

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.590
by a susceptible person.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.450
So let's begin by talking
about the formation of droplets

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.860
during respiration.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.600
So these droplets can
form in different parts

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.220
of the respiratory tract.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.700
So the respiratory tract
refers to the whole system

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.760
of your breathing
apparatus in your body.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.200
So that includes, of
course, your lungs,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.390
which involves a
network of passages

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.210
going from the large bronchus
down to the bronchioles

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.240
and ultimately to the alveolar
sacs where the air is exchanged

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.730
or oxygen gets into the
blood and carbon dioxide

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.670
is picked up, and
then you exhale.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.080
In the upper respiratory
tract, we have of course

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.470
the mouth and the nose
and the larynx, the voice

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.530
box where sounds are made.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.300
The nasopharynx is
sort of the region

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.470
behind the mouth
and the nose where

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.900
the passages are connected.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.270
And in all of those
different regions

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.640
of the respiratory tract,
when we breathe in,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.280
air is coming through
in one direction,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.979
and of course when we
exhale, it's coming back out.

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.000
And there is a lot of
fluid in the lungs.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.880
So the airways are
lined typically

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.210
with surfactant film
and mucus, which

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.039
is a thick substance
we're all familiar with.

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.110
It can vary in composition
but generally has

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.420
some large macromolecules
and in particular proteins

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.970
that are called
mucins, which give it

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.860
it's sort of thick consistency.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.160
There are also ions such as
sodium and chloride, which

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.050
are dissolved in the liquid.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.880
And even liquid such
as saliva in your mouth

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.370
have a similar composition but
less of the sort of thick mucin

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.370
proteins that I mentioned
compared to the deeper

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.540
parts the respiratory tract.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.950
Of course, when
someone gets sick,

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.730
also there can be more of
the sort of mucus and phlegm

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.190
that's generated to help the
body deal with the pathogen.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.930
So all those liquids
and fluids are

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.000
present in different parts
of the respiratory tract.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.950
And so there are a number of
mechanisms which are still

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.550
subject to scientific
research and debate by which

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.150
droplets are created
and ultimately emitted

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.280
when a person is breathing out.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.210
So let's begin by thinking
about such processes

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.880
in the upper respiratory tract.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.100
So in the upper
respiratory tract,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.900
we can imagine, first of
all, that the passages have

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.430
a little bit larger spacing.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.070
So for example, your mouth
might be open by centimeters

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.480
or millimeters.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.700
If you go into
your nose, there's

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.240
of course various hairs and
smaller structures which

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.250
are often covered with mucus
and liquids, which as the air

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.370
is passing by, could be leading
to some breakup of droplets.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.670
And then of course also in
the voicebox and other areas

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.840
of the upper respiratory tract.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:53.640
So the main mechanism here
for generating droplets

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.650
would be the breakup of
viscoelastic filaments

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.300
in a fluid flow.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.010
So another word for
breakup is fragmentation

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:15.060
of viscoelastic filaments.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.829
And by that, I mean that the
mucus especially is a fluid.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.640
So it has a viscosity, a
resistance to shear flow.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.320
But it also can have
some elasticity.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.320
If you pull on it, it can
pull back a little bit

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.730
because there are these
macromolecules present.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.610
So in general, we have a
somewhat complicated reality

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.900
of that liquid or that fluid.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.000
And a filament
refers to the fact

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.430
that those droplets
can be stretched out,

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.110
and as the air is then
blowing past those filaments,

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.420
it can start to break up.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.260
So this is our basic mechanism.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.450
And this is mainly
going to be happening

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:56.450
while a person is exhaling, at
least in terms of emissions.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.920
It's also possible
when you Inhale,

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.710
there'll be some of
those droplets created.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.200
They go into your lungs or
get deposited on the surfaces

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.690
and then manage to somehow
come back out again.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.570
But certainly during exhaling,
you would imagine more--

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.480
or you could see actually that
more droplets are created.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.200
So if we think of
some examples of that,

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.850
we might have, for example,
when I'm speaking or breathing

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.930
and my mouth is a
little bit open,

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:30.770
if I imagine drawing kind
of let's say a person's lips

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.080
and mouth might look
something like this.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.810
So I'm kind of
exaggerating here,

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.320
but of course there's
saliva present,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.310
and there may be little
filaments that form.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.830
Of course, we can see this.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.000
And then as we're inhaling, and
especially as we're exhaling,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.860
then these filaments will kind
of bend and they can break,

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.110
and some of them
will be emitted.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.070
And in fact, these have
been recently visualized

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.220
in great detail.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.710
And anyway, so
that's one mechanism.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.780
So it's these
filaments of saliva

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:15.450
in this case could
be forming around--

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.790
I'll just mention
this picture might

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.380
be, for example, the mouth.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.080
We could also look at
the act of speaking.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.430
We will discuss in detail
later in this course

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.100
that the emissions of
infectious droplets

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.130
is very strongly correlated
with vocalization.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.860
If you're speaking,
there's many more emissions

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.300
than when you're just
simply breathing,

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.480
and when you're speaking
in a louder volume

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.600
or when you're singing,
that rate of emission

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.850
goes up very significantly.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.980
So there's clearly emissions
related to the vocal--

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.140
the voicebox and to the
vocal folds in the glottis,

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.500
which is basically the voicebox.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:04.950
So what that looks like is if
you take kind of a side view,

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.470
there are these--

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.890
as a cross-sectional
view, there's

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.400
these folds where the
air is flowing through,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.290
let's say, in this direction.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.290
And these are kind
of waving together.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.090
They're vibrating where
the frequency could

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.860
be, for example,
100 hertz depending

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:24.360
on the tone of your speech
and the type of vowels

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.720
you're making or other sounds.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.130
And again, what we
have is that some here

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.420
are saying this might
be in the glottis.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.780
This could be the vocal folds.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.270
And this is basically
the voicebox,

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.490
is more colloquial term.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.770
And as the air is
flowing through there,

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.159
this part is vibrating.

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:52.450
So there's some kind
of maybe motion.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.280
I'll just kind of
indicate like this

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.850
just that this is kind
of shaking and vibrating

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.440
and coming together.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.810
And of course,
there's also mucus

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.240
and other liquids that are
here lining all these things.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.600
And when those folds
come close together,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.230
they touch each other, and they
can pull apart and again form

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.470
these filaments that can
break up and generate

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.950
droplets that will be
emitted of different sizes.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.350
Now, one thing to notice
is the length scale,

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.520
so the mouth when it's opening
might have a length scale

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.980
obviously on the order of maybe
centimeters but more likely

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.180
millimeters in the regions
where there could actually

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.150
be emissions of droplets.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.120
If we look at the vocal
cords, that scale is also

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.460
going to be millimeters, but
when the vocal cords really

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.990
come together and
pull apart, we might

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.820
be looking at scales that
are much smaller than that.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.770
So some of these filaments
that are breaking up

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.080
could be significantly
smaller, and so

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.760
vocalization may lead to
droplets that are quite a bit

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.260
smaller.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.550
In fact, in the case of the
mouth, as I just mentioned,

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.130
the sort of length scale might
be of order of millimeters

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.890
for the filaments
that are breaking up.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.680
And the size of the
droplets R might

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:06.140
be on the order of 10 to
100 microns or even bigger,

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:06.640
actually.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.880
In fact, it can even
go up to-- well,

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.500
maybe not quite millimeters, but
in the case of, let's say when

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.960
you're coughing or spitting,
certainly you are spitting out

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.630
millimeters, but
it could be even--

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.250
maybe I'll put even
here 1 millimeter

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.040
as sort of a kind of upper
bound on the types of droplets

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.840
that you could be emitting.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.930
In the case of the voicebox, our
length scale's a bit smaller.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.930
It might be on the order
more like of 100 microns

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.430
for these filaments
that are breaking up.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.920
And the radius of droplets
that you're going to form

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.510
are going to be
smaller, and they

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.510
might be ranging
more in the 1 to 10

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.510
micron range or
possibly larger, again,

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.560
depending on the details.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.750
If you're coughing and
there's a lot of mucus here,

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:49.260
certainly you could get maybe
larger than that as well.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.610
So breakup of filaments
is a primary mechanism

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:56.760
of drop formation, especially
in the upper respiratory tract.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.970
Now what about in the
lower respiratory tract?

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.680
So that's really
referring to your lungs.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:14.890
So in the lower
respiratory tract,

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:21.060
there is significant
evidence and also at least

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.010
qualitative theories
and to some extent

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:27.880
quantitative theories showing
that the main mechanism is not

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.850
so much the breakup of
filaments in a flow,

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:39.550
but rather the bursting
of filaments of mucus

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.760
but in much smaller
domains, where it's not

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.310
so much that the fluid is
whipping by and breaking apart

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.350
the droplets, but it's simply
breaking up due to surface

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.890
tension.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:50.830
Just that it's this
instability kind

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.490
of like in a dripping faucet
or a stream of liquid when you

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.660
start to stretch it out and
let surface tension act,

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.160
it kind of squeezes
down, eventually

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.190
wants to make droplets.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.130
So that's kind of the
rupture of a film.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.590
Under surface tension, it's
more likely to be the mechanism.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:09.700
And so this is kind of
maybe more generally

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:18.690
can be thought of as an
elastocapillarity instability

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:32.130
of mucosal films,
specifically in the deepest

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:35.940
part of the lungs and
in the smallest passages

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:43.170
during during inhaling
in the bronchioles

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.450
and also, to some
extent, in the alveola.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:58.450
During inhaling, that's when
the breakup is happening,

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.400
and then any droplets
that are creating,

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.670
some may deposit on the walls
of the respiratory tract,

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.490
but some fraction of them
will be swept back out again.

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.650
So let me explain this a
little bit more detail.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.400
I should also mention
this mechanism is also

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:21.620
referred to as the bronchial
film burst hypothesis.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.820
And I say it's a hypothesis
because despite the fact

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.310
that there's been a lot
of study of the droplets

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.190
that are produced by
different forms of respiration

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.920
and some theoretical
modeling, it's

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.580
difficult to actually observe
this process occurring

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.910
in the body.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.430
And so it's still--

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.560
it's a hypothesis that
people are still studying.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.350
So what we're
thinking of here is

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:54.760
if we zoom in to a bronchiole,
which is a passage that looks

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.880
maybe something like this,
it's like basically it's

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.470
a flexible tube.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.660
And the smallest
ones of these now

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:05.540
are getting down to the
scale of 100 microns or so.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.750
So it is kind of like a
typical length scale here of,

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:13.170
let's say for the radius,
might be 100 microns or less.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:17.160
And these of course are
lined with mucus as well.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.620
And in some places,
there's a bridge.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:28.780
So it's kind of like there's
almost like bubbles of air

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.490
with sort of little
bridges of mucus.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.470
In fact, you may actually
have even some places

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.440
where the passage after exhale
has completely collapsed.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.290
And so maybe some parts
of it are touching.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.150
Others are not touching.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:46.510
But there's kind of these little
bridges of liquid or films,

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:51.070
bronchial films that are kind of
extending across at least part

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.620
or even all of those channels.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.470
Now, imagine we start
in this situation,

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.700
and we start inhaling.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.490
And let's just say this is
the direction of inhaling.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:02.310
Let's imagine that
the alveola, which

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.970
is kind of on the end
of this tube, and so

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.560
let's see what happens
if we start inhaling.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.120
So for inhaling, then
the air is flowing in.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.580
And so the first
thing that happens

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:21.240
is that these bubbles are
going to start essentially--

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.850
this film is essentially
going to be pushed.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:27.180
As that liquid is being pushed,
we have some flows occurring.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.950
There's some recirculation
flows in there.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.430
Also, there's interaction with
the elastic or stretchy walls,

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.980
which are soft,
of the bronchiole,

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.710
and so it can expand.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.200
So if you go to
the next step, you

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.590
may find as you continue
inhaling that now this tube has

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:46.460
expanded a bit.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.840
So it might look more like this.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:57.290
And then this, to
some extent, this film

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:58.790
would start to get stretched.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.590
And then at some point, as
this thing is trying to open,

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.190
and also it's under some
flow, but it's going to burst.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.350
And this bursting again
is not quite the same

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.970
as this situation because
the flows are much slower.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:21.500
So here, these flows are often
at so-called high Reynolds

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.170
number, as we'll talk
about later in this class.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.940
High Reynolds number refers
to the tendency of the flow

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.120
to become unstable and for
inertial effects and momentum

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.330
of fluid to become important.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.370
At the scale of the mouth or the
nose or even the vocal cords,

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.460
there can be significant
inertial effects and very

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.680
complex flows.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.180
On the other hand,
when we get down

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.040
to the smallest
channels in the lungs,

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.420
and especially
when we reach kind

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.030
of the dead end, these
sort of the alveolas, which

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.610
is basically a bunch
of little sacs,

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:55.200
they're kind of at the end here,
then it's kind of a dead end.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.930
There can't be any like very
fast flow through that system.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.840
And so it's actually a low
Reynolds number situation.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.390
So we're not talking about
turbulent flows or sprays

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.950
of liquid at high
Reynolds number.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.080
Instead, we're
talking about films

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.630
that are getting stretched out,
and then they simply break up

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.330
under the effect of
capilarity, which

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.580
refers to surface tension.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.210
So basically, when
you expose a surface

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:19.790
and stretch out a
liquid film, it just

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:22.470
tends to break up into
little droplets, basically

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.000
in order to minimize its energy.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.360
So what we'll see
here is that maybe one

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.860
of these films over
here has already

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.370
burst and will lead
to some droplets that

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.120
are being created.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:42.650
So this bursting of the film
is what leads to the droplets.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.630
And when you're
inhaling, those get swept

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.010
a little further downstream.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.070
Some of them may deposit on the
walls and go back into the film

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.680
and coalesce into the
film, but others will

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.540
remain suspended in the air.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.750
And now when you
exhale, you start

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.190
pushing back the other way.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:04.500
The tube is more
open now, and we

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.440
may have a situation
like this where there's

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.410
no more sort of
spanning films left,

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.250
but there's some fraction
of these droplets.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:14.640
A few of them may have deposited
and coalesced on the surfaces,

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.069
but they're going to start
getting blown out the other way

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.569
now.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.730
And so these are the droplet
emissions right here.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.150
I'll just say it'll
eventually do that.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.000
So some fraction of these
will make it all the way out.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.850
Of course, those droplets
can deposit anywhere

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:35.900
in the respiratory tract.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.040
In fact, some of them, if you're
breathing through your nose,

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.080
may end up getting caught
in your nose, actually.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.000
And so there's an
exchange of fluids

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.250
between the different parts
of the respiratory tract,

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.620
but some fraction of those
droplets will get out.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.230
And then ultimately, when
you're finished exhaling,

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.800
now the pressure is released.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:56.760
And this tube kind of relaxes
back to its original state

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.730
where there's some mucus here
and there's some places maybe

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:05.310
where it's closed and there's
these possibly spanning films

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.860
in some places where
it's almost touching.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.650
So these are some of
the basic processes

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.650
by which droplets are emitted.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.380
As you can see by the range
of different processes

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.970
that are possible in
the human physiology

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.350
that we've just
described, we can

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:24.030
see there's a range
of droplet sizes

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.420
that will depend on the
respiratory activity.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.230
Are you breathing lightly
because you're sleeping?

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.040
Are you breathing
heavily at high speeds

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.600
because you're exercising?

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.670
Are you vocalizing
and generating

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.730
droplets in a different
way in the larynx?

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.680
All those activities
play a role.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.540
And also there are variations
between individuals.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.980
And finally, if a person is
sick and all these fluids

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.940
I've sketched here as mucus
contain pathogens such as virus

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.600
or bacteria, then of course
the degree of infection,

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.780
the viral load or the
total amount of pathogen,

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.600
the total amount of
bacteria plays a role

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.880
as well in sort
of how infectious

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.980
the emissions are
from breathing.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.870
But these are some of
the basic principles.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.200
And now we'll move on to ask,
what happens to those droplets

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:15.230
after they leave the mouth
of the infected person?
