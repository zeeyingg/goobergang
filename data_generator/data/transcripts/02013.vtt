WEBVTT

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.080
PROFESSOR: So now,
let me make the first

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.040
of our technical asides, which
you can skip over if you're not

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.630
interested in the
mathematical details

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.570
or for those of you that
have a higher-level,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.500
say, upper-level-undergraduate
or even graduate-level

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.160
understanding of transport
phenomena and fluid mechanics.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.350
I'd like to show you some
of the equations that

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.000
are behind the
results that I've been

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.430
quoting in all the lectures.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.830
So in particular, let's
derive the Wells curve.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:45.280
So part of that was a
theory of drop settling.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.950
Here, I will quote
a certain result,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.620
because the derivation
would be a lot longer.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.240
Actually, for that, you could
refer to my online class 10.50x,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.320
which is that if you have
a droplet or a particle

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.710
of a radius R and it is
settling under gravity--

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.870
so it has a mass m, and the
gravitational force is m g,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.600
where g is the
gravitational acceleration--

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.310
then there is a flow of
fluid around this object.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.730
And relative to
the moving object,

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.280
the flow is going the other way.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.620
And if you solve
for the viscous flow

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.800
around an object being
dragged through a fluid,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.400
then you arrive at the
result of Stokes, which

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.390
is the drag on that fluid.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.200
So if you're falling
at a velocity v,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:48.259
then the drag
force is -- f_d is -- 6*pi

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.590
times the radius of the
drop times the viscosity

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.410
of the fluid times the
velocity of the drop.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.140
So we're falling
at a velocity v,

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.720
which is the settling velocity.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.240
And this here is the
Stokes drag coefficient,

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.990
which comes from solving the
fluid mechanics of viscous flow

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.330
around a sphere translating
at a constant speed.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:18.500
We can, furthermore, say that the
mass of the droplet, of course,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.990
is 4*pi/3 times the density
of the droplet liquid, times

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.060
the radius cubed.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.180
And so given the
mass of the droplet,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.340
there's a force balance
between the gravitational force

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.740
m g and the drag force when the
particle reaches a terminal

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.410
velocity.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.800
So if we think of this v_s as
the terminal velocity where

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.510
it's accelerating until there's
a balance between the forces

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.040
and is moving at a speed, it's
given by this force balance.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.660
And from that
equation, we can solve

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.900
for the settling velocity, which
is energy divided by 6*pi*R.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.110
And to use the same
notation as before,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.460
I'll call this mu_a -- the
air -- but generally, it's

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.550
the viscosity of
the ambient fluid

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.370
around the particle
as it's settling.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:15.150
And if we plug in the value
for m g, so that's 4/3*pi*rho*g*

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.940
R^3 over 6*pi*R*rho_a.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.740
And so we simplify
that, we end up

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:32.310
with (2/9)*rho*g*r^2/mu_a.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.570
So that's the settling speed.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.190
And this is a pretty
important concept,

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.010
so I'll just sketch it here.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.740
So if we want to know
what's the settling

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.870
speed as a function of
the radius of the drop,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.000
then you see it
grows like R^2.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.890
So it's like this.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.060
And then to put a scale on
that, if we have a particle that

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.430
is 3 microns -- so that's
really an aerosol particle --

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.730
then the settling speed
is around 1 millimeter

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.430
a second if we use
the density of water

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.150
and the viscosity of
air for this formula.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.310
And so that's already a
fairly slow settling speed,

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.430
millimeter per second.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.620
So you can already
see the particles that

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.630
are in the micron
range will be suspended

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.190
in the air for a
long period of time,

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.800
as long as they
don't evaporate away.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.020
And so that is now the second
part of the calculation.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.620
Oh, and I should the
finish the first part here.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:38.460
What we're left with is that
the settling time is L over v_s.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.500
And that's the formula
that we had before,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:50.010
which is 9*mu_a*L divided
by 2*rho*g*r^2.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.670
So this is our first
part of the Wells curve.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.930
So if I draw the
Wells curve over here

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.030
in the traditional way, where
I plot on the horizontal

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.540
axis the size of the particle,
and in a downward axis,

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:13.030
we draw the time, then we have
a curve like this for settling.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.410
And the reason it's drawn
down, I guess maybe the feeling

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.190
that as you're sort of falling
down a particle a certain size,

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.690
you hit this curve and that's
when you've settled a distance

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.480
L and fallen out of the air.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.640
So now, let's look
at evaporation,

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.160
which is our second topic.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.460
I've lost my blue [marker] -- here it is.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.240
So these droplets are
getting very small

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.200
as they're evaporating,

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.930
and it's happening very quickly,
as we shall show in a moment.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.510
And so a natural assumption
is that the process

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:56.110
is limited by the
diffusion of water vapor

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.540
away from the droplet,
because essentially we

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.730
have this little droplet
here with a certain size

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.580
R, which is now going
to be varying with time.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.850
So it has a radius R(t).

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.660
And it's really
close to the surface.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.700
There is an equilibrium
concentration --

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.950
we'll call it c_w --

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.750
of water, which depends
on the temperature.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.720
So that's kind of the
saturation concentration

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.020
of water vapor in the air.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.360
But then, if the water is
going to evaporate more,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.760
it would create more
concentration, which would then

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.080
re-condense on the particle.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.800
So in order for it to
continue evaporating,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.230
that water vapor that is
produced has to diffuse away.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.210
So there's going to be a
gradient of water vapor going

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:50.130
outwards from c_w -- [it] is the
concentration at position R.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:55.170
And then far away, there is
a sort of diffusion layer

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.810
thickness, delta.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.210
And far beyond the
diffusion layer thickness,

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.540
the concentration is going
to approach the equilibrium

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.640
concentration in
the ambient air.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.150
c at infinity is going to be
c_w times the relative humidity.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.200
So that's the ratio of
the concentration of water

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.590
vapor in the air to the
saturation concentration,

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.790
c_w, by definition.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.210
Now, the math
problem that we have

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.720
to solve for this diffusion
problem -- with a moving boundary

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.110
in this case, though we'll
assume it's pseudosteady --

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.620
is dc/dt is the diffusion
coefficient of water

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.300
times the Laplacian
of c, so just

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.520
the diffusion equation with
these two boundary conditions.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.600
Now, an interesting aspect a
three-dimensional spherical

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.030
diffusion is that at first
the diffusion layer grows,

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.620
but it very quickly
reaches a steady state.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.220
And if we assume that
that diffusion time

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.100
to reach this distance
delta is fast,

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.650
so they reach a
steady state, so it's

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.750
a kind of quasisteady or
pseudosteady shrinking

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.050
of the droplet with sort of
a diffusion layer around it

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.510
that's always kind of
at the steady value,

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.900
then it turns out that
this diffusion layer

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.400
is on the order of the
particle size.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.950
So as the particle shrinks, the
diffusion layer also shrinks.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.840
But it has a
well-defined thickness,

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.480
as opposed to
diffusion in one or two

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.230
dimensions, where the
diffusion layer just

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.680
keeps growing out to infinity.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.130
For example, like
square root of time --

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.050
you don't reach a steady
state in an infinite domain.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.310
So the bottom line
of this calculation,

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.280
which I will not go
through right now,

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.010
is that the flux of
water on the surface

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.330
is the area of the surface at a
given moment, where the size is

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:37.600
R, times essentially
Fick's law, where

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.120
the driving force, the
change in concentration

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.390
from the surface to
the bulk, is c_w times

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.900
one minus relative humidity,
the diffusivity of water,

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.800
and then divided by delta,
the diffusion layer thickness.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.320
And it turns out that with
these coefficients here,

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.750
it turns out to be exactly R.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.630
So this is not a scaling
result, but actually

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:59.470
an exact result for pseudo
steady spherical diffusion

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.400
of water vapor.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.070
So now, we have the
flux on the surface.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.540
It's uniform on the surface.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.360
And it's [assumed]
to be pseudosteady.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.060
And so then I can write
down that the change

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.120
in the size of the water
droplet volume, which

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:20.170
is (4*pi/3)*R^3
is equal to minus

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:25.820
the volume of a water molecule
times the flux of water.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:31.520
So that's basically my volume
or mass balance of water.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:38.690
So if I plug this in here,
then I get dR/dt is equal to --

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.750
let's see, collecting
all the terms here --

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.590
so derivative of R^3
is 3*R^2.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.490
So the 3's cancel.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.380
And then I have
a 4*pi*R^2,

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.370
which cancels this
4*pi*R^2.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:10:00.930
So I just have dR/dt is
-v_w*D_w*c_w*(1-RH)/R.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:06.200
If I put this R on the other
side here, then I have --

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.510
I'll just continue
the derivation here --

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:17.320
I have R dR/dt is equal
to all this stuff.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:25.010
So -v_w*D_w*c_w*(1-RH).

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.960
And then this
expression here can

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:34.800
be written as 1/2 the
derivative of R^2.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.890
So what we find is that R^2
is linear in time.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.000
And then using the boundary
condition that we start out

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.840
at a certain initial
value, R_0, then I'm

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:54.910
going to get the R(t) is
the initial value R_0 times

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:59.560
the square root of 1 minus
t over a certain evaporation

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.240
time.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:07.160
And that evaporation
time is given here

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:17.500
by (R_0)^2 times basically
all these coefficients here,

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.340
where I'll separate out
the effective humidity,

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.720
and then a bunch of other
coefficients, which you can see

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.630
have units of length
squared over time,

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.180
because R_0 is a length squared.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.920
So it's effectively some
kind of diffusivity.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.080
And what we get from
this calculation

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.910
is that this
effective diffusivity

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.700
that goes into this
expression is -- there's

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.050
a factor 2 from this guy --

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:44.380
there's a 2*v_w*D_w*c_w.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.240
And if you plug in
values for water vapor,

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.670
for the saturation pressure,
and the diffusivity,

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:53.030
and the volume of water in
air, then this coefficient

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:58.190
turns out to be 1.2e-9
meters squared

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:02.200
for second for pure water.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.420
And that's where you get now
the second part of the Wells

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.000
theory, which is the
evaporation, which gives you

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.230
a curve looking like this.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.270
So that there's this
sort of in this theory

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:25.820
a natural crossover between
large drops, which in this case

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.070
here are ones that are
large enough to settle out

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.260
of the fluid before
they evaporate,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:38.400
and small drops,
which evaporate.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.070
On the other hand, for
true biological fluids

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.420
that appear in
respiratory droplets,

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:49.170
the evaporation is limited
by solutes and salts, which

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.240
stop the evaporation
and, in fact,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.740
can attract even more
water in some cases.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.060
So that the evaporation part
of it is not as accurate,

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.030
and we tend to see that
the settling part is more

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.510
important to consider, given
an equilibrium distribution

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.100
of droplets that
has been measured

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:10.520
and is understood to come from
different types of respiration.
