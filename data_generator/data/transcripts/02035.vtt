WEBVTT

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.330
PROFESSOR: So now
let's synthesize

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.670
all of our models of aerosol
generation and dynamics

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.170
in a well-mixed indoor space
and epidemiological models

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.920
of spreading and transfer
of disease in that space

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.970
and formulate a safety
guideline for COVID-19

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.610
assuming indoor
airborne transmission

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.630
in a well-mixed room.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.620
And so there's a number of
ways we could go about this.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.960
And the approach that
I would like to propose

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.010
is that we require that the
indoor reproductive number is

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.540
less than some tolerance.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.640
So this epsilon here
is the tolerance.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.970
So typically something
might be a lot less

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.270
than 1 or maybe you get to
allow it to be closer to 1.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.700
And so that is essentially
the probability

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.069
of a transmission
from one infector that

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:16.010
enters the room at t equals
0 and stays for a time

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.830
tau in the presence of a
total number of n people

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.530
in the room, which is the
occupancy of the room.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.360
So obviously, this
doesn't handle

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.770
every possible situation.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.590
It is possible, if there is
a very prevalent infection

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.170
rate in the community
that the room may

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.330
find several infectors entering
at once, in which case,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.270
we could certainly
increase this number.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.750
And then the 1 here
would be replaced by i0

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.940
as we've seen before.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.090
On the other hand, if you're
interested in controlling

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.250
the spread of the
disease and you're not

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.800
worried about a specific person,
but you just want to say,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.729
I would like to make
this room not contribute

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.940
to spreading of the disease--

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.100
and imagine if
everybody did that,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.479
then no rooms would contribute
to spreading the disease--

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.070
so then this criteria would
say that if two infectors came,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.660
they might infect two
people, or three infectors,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.080
you're worried
about three people.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.880
Well we want to make sure is
that the number of infectors

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.930
is not growing.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.730
So in other words, if
there's one infector,

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.250
they don't infect another one.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.960
So the fact that there
are more infectors

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.150
gives a chance of at
least some infection,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.700
but this seems like a more
general and simpler criterion.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.600
It's also a little bit like
when the fire department

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.790
looks at a room and
decides on occupancy

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.070
limit for an indoor space.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.730
There's no fire going on.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.110
They're not estimating what's
the probability of a fire.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.060
It's a conditional probability.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.010
They're saying,
if there's a fire,

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.360
we want to make sure
these people can get out.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.540
And so they think about
where the fire might start,

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.670
where the smoke is,
where are exits,

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.410
and how many people
can realistically

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.140
get out of that room before
the fire and the smoke

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.160
reach a dangerous level.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.450
So this indoor safety
guideline has a similar flavor,

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.780
where we're essentially defining
here the number of people

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.690
and also the amount of occupancy
time that would be allowable.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.870
So that it'd be unlikely
for one infector

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.260
to create a new infection
and hence spread the disease.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.850
So that is the basic thinking.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:25.100
So this it's basically the
conditional probability

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:34.760
of spreading given this, that
an infector enters at times 0

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.630
and stays for a time t.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.010
So that's basically how we
formulate the guideline.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.700
And now let's think about--

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.250
already at this
level without getting

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.150
into the details of what goes
into beta, which we've already

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.310
talked about, there's a
very important concept here,

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.940
which is that if I define
beta with brackets here to be

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.730
the average transmission rate.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.570
So the transmission rate
may be changing in time,

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.760
for example, as droplets
are building up in the room

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.970
as we've discussed.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.240
But let's just think of kind of
an average transmission rate.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.430
Then this integral in time
is just beta brackets,

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.529
beta average times tau.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.750
So if I put the beta
bracket on the other side,

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.010
I arrive at a very
fundamental result,

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.740
which is that the number of
susceptibles in the room,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.730
which is roughly the occupancy--

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.360
although, if you're
very low occupancy,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.690
it's everybody but the infected
person, so it's n minus 1--

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.490
times the typical time spent in
the room by the infected person

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.590
is less than the
tolerance divided

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.090
by the average
transmission rate.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.980
This is very simple
and very general

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.300
relationship, which does not
depend on the details of beta.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.640
But what it's telling you is
something which already you

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.610
may recognize is very
different than any

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.270
of the existing official
safety guidelines.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.460
Official safety guidelines
always limit one quantity.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.620
For example, they might limit
the number of people in a room.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.710
They also can get a limit such
as that from social distancing.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.700
So you could take the
area of the room, divide

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.550
by a little six foot
radius around each person--

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.550
or a three foot
radius or a six foot

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.740
separation-- and
get at an occupancy.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.720
So you fix n.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.690
The problem with that is
that time has to play a role.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.070
If a certain number
of people are

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.370
in a room for a very short
time, it's really unlikely

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.600
to have any transmission.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.970
But if the same number
stays for a very long time,

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.050
eventually some transmission
must take place.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.860
So time has to be important.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.930
You will also find
limits on time.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.659
The CDC defines a contact
where transmission

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:48.170
is possible as being within six
feet of an infectious person

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.550
for more than 15 minutes.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.050
So there is a time
constraint there.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.890
So it says that
after 15 minutes,

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.090
you should expect to be
potentially infected.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.680
But the problem
is that that's not

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.000
accounting for transmission rate
factors, such as ventilation

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.920
and all the things
that we've discussed,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.240
and also the occupancy.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.680
So how many people could
you transmit it to?

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.210
If you're by yourself
in a room or there's

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.160
only two or three people
in a very large space,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.170
are you really going to
transmit in 15 minutes?

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.090
Not necessarily.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.040
And anyway, so
that is the problem

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.040
with those kinds of criteria.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.370
And it can be easily seen by
plotting this relationship

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.870
here.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.870
So by the way,
this quantity here,

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.680
which is the product of n
and t, or n minus one and t,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:42.500
is what I like to call the
cumulative you exposure time.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.190
So the time that you're exposed
to the infected individual,

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.659
tau, is multiplied by how many
other people are in the room

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:56.760
because that's how many
people could get infected.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.990
So the more people that there
are, the more chance that one

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.800
of them could be infected
in a well-mixed room.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.760
And so you really don't have
a bound just on time.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.020
It's really this product
that's important.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.210
And so let's plot what
this looks like now.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:14.900
So if we have here the time
and here the occupancy,

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:20.770
then this guideline is a
bound that looks like this.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.770
It saturates at one.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.280
So basically, if you're
below this guideline here,

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.330
you're considered safe.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.070
And up here is
potentially unsafe.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.770
Meaning that given the
tolerance that you've chosen,

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.150
you would expect
that there could

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.460
be a transmission with
greater than that probability.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.850
OK.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.470
It saturates at one because
it will never go below one.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.350
Because only one
person, you're not

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.760
going to transmit to anybody.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.140
So it's OK.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.760
So an occupancy of one is
OK, except in a building

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.640
where perhaps other
people have come and gone

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.800
from that room or ventilation
is bringing particles

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.510
from other rooms.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.670
And we'll come back to that.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.850
But just at the simple
level of analyzing one room,

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.130
obviously one is fine.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.500
And here you see a very
fundamental problem

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.930
that I was just
alluding to, which

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:18.250
is that if I put the standard
guidelines on-- for example,

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.740
a limit on number of people.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.100
So this could be
fixed occupancy.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:36.179
And in fact, in Massachusetts,
for example, right now

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:39.350
there is a guideline which
says n is less than 25.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.870
No more than 25 persons
can congregate in a room.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.020
In fact, I'm teaching
class right now which

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.420
we have 51 people, and I was
able to split into two rooms.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.170
And then this rule
came along, and then we

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.000
had to start doing three,
remotely broadcasting

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.150
between those rooms because
we have a 25 person rule.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.820
The problem with that rule is it
doesn't take into account time.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.920
What if my class is
only five minutes long?

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.290
Or let's say it's
one-hour long, OK.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.680
In that time, if I don't have
an expectation transmission,

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.370
I should be OK.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:08.910
On the other hand,
if those 20 people

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.050
sit in the classroom
for several weeks,

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.550
it's pretty likely that if an
infected person is among them,

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.750
there will be a transmission.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.280
So time has to come in.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.840
And that you see
very clearly here

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.780
from the crossing of the fixed
occupancy with the safety

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:22.660
guideline.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.790
So for a short amount of
time, the fixed occupancy,

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.030
which is telling you
should be under this--

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.790
so basically you should
only have a lower occupancy.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.790
So this is a fixed
occupancy bound.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.400
For example, the one
in Massachusetts.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.250
At first, this is
too conservative.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.600
So you are telling people
they cannot be in the space,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.310
but until this amount
of time has passed,

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.950
it's very unlikely that
anybody would transmit.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.290
Imagine this time as one minute.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.880
It's pretty unlikely that you're
going to have a transmission.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.500
On the other hand,
if you keep waiting,

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.780
you always cross
the yellow line.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:12.550
And over here it's too risky
and too dangerous, basically.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.390
Because you're allowing
people to think that

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.250
they're safe because
there's only 25.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.280
But let's say this crossover
happens after one hour,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.200
and the people are in
the room for five hours,

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.570
there's a very high
risk of transmission.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.910
So just putting out
a number like 25

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.370
doesn't really protect you
because these lines always

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:29.360
cross.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.120
You will always cross the safety
guideline at a certain time.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.660
That's the safe time.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.510
OK.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.030
Similarly, so basically-- so
let me just kind of stress that

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.530
here.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:42.360
So this is basically, what
we're really concerned is this.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.370
We're very concerned
about situations

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.460
where a guideline is giving
people the sense of protection,

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.290
and in fact they're
at high-risk.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.510
We're also concerned
about this case here.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.070
Because for example, as
in the case of my class,

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.670
we might be causing some
damage to people's education

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.890
or to their businesses
or to the economy

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:03.160
by shutting down a certain
space or imposing a limit that

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.500
doesn't have really a strong
scientific basis because we

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.950
don't expect
transmission to happen

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.180
under those circumstances.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.430
So we're concerned about both.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.010
But I'm particularly concerned
about the overly risky case

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.740
because that is contributing
to transmission of the disease,

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:18.120
and potentially loss of life.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.750
Now, if we look in
the other direction,

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.150
we have the same kind of issue.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.250
So if we have a time limit--
for example, let's say here.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.940
You know, this
could be like this.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.390
So this would be a fixed time.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:39.630
For example, 15
minutes from the CDC

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.260
is the time they
recommend for contact.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.020
So that's a pretty short time.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.360
OK, and what a
guideline like that says

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.430
is that if you're
in the presence

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:48.600
of an infected person--

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:54.780
sufficiently close-- for 15
minutes, then here you're safe,

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.210
but over here you're unsafe.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:57.840
But again, you have
the same phenomena.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.830
Now, 15 minutes is
a pretty short time,

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.490
so that's typically
going to be safe.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.250
But again, in this region
it's too conservative.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.520
So the blue here is
still too conservative.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.060
But now, when you get up
here, even the 15-minute rule

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.080
eventually becomes unsafe.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.380
Because if there's a very
large amount people in a room

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.480
and they also can interact with
each other through well-mixed

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.360
space--

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.660
so I'm not talking about
a really, really big room.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.520
I'm talking about
a small enough room

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.910
that you could expect air to be
transmitted between the people

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.020
in that space--

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.670
then if I keep
increasing occupancy,

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:30.920
again I cross that line.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.850
There's always a crossing.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:36.360
So you cannot have a guideline
only based on time or only

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.680
based on occupancy.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.480
If you think of this
limit-- for example,

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.500
how about we take for
the 15-minute rule,

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.630
what if I put 15 people or maybe
20 people into a small tent--

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:50.070
just let's say a
little bit bigger

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.480
in the size of this board--

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.580
and everybody's
standing close together.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.190
We might pass the infection in
much less time than 15 minutes

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.940
because we have a chance
to infect each other,

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.140
and if I keep going up, I'm
going to cross that line.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.280
And the tent also has a very
small volume, poor ventilation,

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.520
and this yellow
curve is very low.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.820
OK, so this concept
of the cumulative exposure time

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.010
is really important
to understand

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:12.240
because it's very general.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.320
It really isn't so tied to
the details of the model.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.830
And it just shows
you that any bound

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.980
on one parameter such
as occupancy, time,

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.680
and I should mention
also social distance.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:28.280
Because that's the big one
which is happening right now.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.380
Social distance
guidelines-- so this

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:35.860
would be that the distance,
d, is greater than six feet.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.540
And that's a CDC guideline
in the United States.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:43.360
It can be greater than one
meter, which is 3 feet,

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.770
and that's from the World
Health Organization.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.780
So about half the distance.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.820
That leads to a guideline
where there's still

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:57.680
a maximum occupancy, which is
the area of the room divided

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.920
by d squared, or by some
other factor depending

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.840
how you think people are
going to be arranged.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.550
But basically, you go into the
room, you map out that spacing,

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.320
and you arrive at
a fixed occupancy.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.090
This is being done
everywhere, including

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:12.890
here at MIT right now.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.860
And that still leads
to fixed occupancy.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.420
So regardless of
how it was derived,

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.810
you still have a
fixed occupancy,

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.690
which is too
conservative at first,

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.160
and eventually is too risky.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.070
And you must know
where is that crossover

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.900
point because occupancy
and time are linked.
