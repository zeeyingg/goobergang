WEBVTT

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.330
PROFESSOR: So now let's focus
on the steady-state transmission

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.610
rate, which is really the most
useful in designing a safety

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.110
guideline.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.940
It's also the most
conservative because

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.340
the transient transmission
rate is always

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.750
smaller than a steady state.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.050
So, our formula for the
steady state transmission rate

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.220
is shown here, in
terms of the relaxation

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.610
rate, lambda_c(r), of
the aerosol concentration

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.490
in the air, and
also n_q(r), which

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.820
is the density of infection
quanta in the air, per radius.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.780
So let's sketch some of
the important functions

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.570
here as a function
of radius and try

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.710
to get a sense of how we can
maybe simplify this expression.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.690
First of all, we've
already defined

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.650
C_q, which is the
integral of n_q(r),

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.710
dr. This is the critical
disease parameter, which

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:15.289
is the infection quanta
per exhaled air volume.

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.110
I don't mean to cross that out
but rather just to do this.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.960
So C_q is a very
important quantity for us

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.090
and we will return to that.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.539
That's the quality
that we're going

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:31.500
to want to fit to disease data
for COVID-19, specifically.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.570
And this will be the exhaled
infection quanta per air volume

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.810
and we'll typically
want to measure

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.750
that sort of peak
infectivity of an individual

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.240
in order to design the
conservative criteria.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.190
So what is C_q?

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.960
If I plot this n_q, it has
a bunch of factors in it.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.729
So it has the roughly
constant assumed viral load

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.190
per liquid volume, it
has the infectivity,

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.590
which we've already
argued should be smaller

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.289
in larger droplets because it's
more difficult for the variant

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.310
to diffuse out of those droplets
once you get above, say, 5,

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.350
10 microns, if not less.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.780
There's the droplet
distribution itself,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.960
which depends on the
type of respiration

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.450
but often has a peak
which is submicron

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.420
and then sort of a fairly
broad tail at the higher end,

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.760
with smaller amounts
of larger droplets,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.900
and then V_d is 4
pi r^3, which

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.390
is just the volume of a drop.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.300
So this net quantity,
n_q has some kind

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.829
of peak around 1 micron
or less and then a tail.

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.320
And then in the
integral here, we

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.710
have the integral of n_q over r
is c_q, so that's very important.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.250
But there is these other
factors, p_m and lambda_c,

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.800
or 1/lambda_c.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.960
Each of those
quantities gives us

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.079
a cutoff which makes
the larger droplets less

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.690
important for this problem
of airborne transmission

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.280
in a well-mixed room.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.820
So lambda_c, as you
can see, is a bunch

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.420
of constant factors except
for the sedimentation rate.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.060
So this lambda_a times
(r/rc)^2,

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.910
that is the sort of
radius-dependent change

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.720
of the sedimentation rate
relative to the ventilation

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.340
rate, lambda_a.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.490
So as you can see, this goes
like 1 plus a constant plus,

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.370
r^2.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.340
So as you go to large
r, the inverse of that

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.720
is 1 over a constant plus
r^2, so it goes to 0.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.780
So it provides a cutoff and
the scale for that cutoff

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.720
is what we called r_c, that's
the critical size of a droplet,

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.870
which is just
sedimentary at a rate

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.650
comparable to the
ventilation rate

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.150
because, really,
this is ventilation

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.010
and sedimentation which are
compared when you define r_c.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.320
In addition to that,
we have (p_m)^2,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.430
which is the max penetration,
or transmission factor.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.820
So while masks are
100%, or very efficient,

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.130
filtering large
droplets which don't

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.200
fit through the
fabric or the mesh,

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.790
they're not as good
as filtering

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.930
smaller droplets.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.210
So if you look at the
transmission probability

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.550
when you're down
well below micron,

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.740
most masks are not doing
a great job filtering,

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.940
they may get 5%,
10% if you're lucky,

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.830
depending the
quality of the mask.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.960
But then it comes
down because you

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.630
start to have better and
better blockage of particles

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.399
by the masks.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:22.320
All these factors serve to
cut off this distribution so

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.270
that we're not worried
about the large drops,

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.800
and we're interested
in aerosols.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.510
But it does so, here, in a
way which is quantitative.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.520
So we're not just
arbitrarily saying,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.200
as it's sometimes said
in the field, that

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.980
say 10 microns or 5 microns
is the limit of the aerosols,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.250
but rather, we actually have
a well-defined characteristic

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.600
size that can emerge here.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.820
And the way we can define
that is by taking the full

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.370
expression for the steady
state transmission that is has

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:59.900
the radius-dependent terms in it
and write this as (Q_b)^2/V

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.040
times--

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.690
and then we'll keep the C_q from
the integral of n_r-- C_q times--

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.110
and then we'll imagine that
the remaining radius-dependent

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.030
factors, p_m and
lambda_c, are sampled

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.750
at a certain value, r-bar.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.280
So what is r-bar?

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.650
Well if you know the
function is p_m and lambda_c

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.020
is a function of
r, there is a value

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.960
of r, which we call r-bar,
which is when you actually

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.970
do this full integral,
you would get that value.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.180
So that has to be determined.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.940
It can be done numerically but
you can kind of see graphically

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.280
where it ends up.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.330
What we're asking
here is what is

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.730
the typical value of
the mask penetration

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.830
factor and the relaxation time?

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.100
Well, it's going to be where
the most weight is here,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.040
keeping in mind,
also, that there's

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.650
more volume at the higher
side than at the lower side.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.180
So if we look at how
much activity there is,

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.700
we might want to emphasize that.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.090
So depending on the details
here, somewhere over here

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.690
is going to be r-bar.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.190
What we're saying here is that
even though our theory has

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.650
all of the radius
dependents in it,

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.360
so if you know exactly
the type of masks

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.660
you have and you know p_m(r)
from experimental measurements,

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.910
maybe a lot about the
virion and how infectious

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.330
it is in different-sized
droplets,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.370
or you studied sedimentation--
you have all these functions.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.110
There's a well-defined r-bar
at which you can just

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.760
use this simple expression
in place of actually doing

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.270
those integrals.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.500
So that's actually
useful simplification.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.980
And in addition to
that, we can also

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.820
write this another way,
which can be useful,

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.590
is to take the mask
factor out and write it

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.550
as a quanta emission
rate, lambda_q, where

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.440
lambda_q is Q_b*C_q.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:04.490
This is the quanta emission
rate by an infector.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.410
So if you don't like this notion
infection quanta per volume,

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.480
when you multiply by
the breathing flow rate,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.580
you're actually getting
how many quanta per time

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.300
are being emitted
by the infector.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.850
And then what's leftover
is another factor,

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.550
which I'll call f_d,
which is something

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.810
we'll come back to later, which
is what I call the dilution

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:25.340
factors.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.080
If we take the breath of
an infected individual

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.760
and then it ends
up being diluted

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.630
into the room, the ratio of
the concentration of infection

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.510
quanta, or virions in
the breath compared

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.540
to that which emerges
in the well-mixed room,

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.070
that's the dilution factor.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.159
This will become important
later when we look more closely

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:55.409
at respiratory fluid
mechanics and we

00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:58.800
look at the plumes,
or clouds, of droplets

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.650
that are being emitted by a
person when they're breathing,

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.510
very close to the
person's mouth it's

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.660
a much higher concentration
and eventually it

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.270
gets sort of swirled around
and mixed in the room,

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.480
and it reaches the steady
state values that we calculate.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.230
This f_d gives you that
ratio in some sense

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.870
and gives you a sense
of how bad the risk is

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.230
from short-range transmission
versus the well-mixed room,

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:23.670
so we'll come back to that.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.410
But this is a nice
simplification

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.570
for how we can think about
the steady transmission

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:31.110
rate in terms of several
key variables, which

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.679
I've boxed here.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:37.580
And so we will now move on
to applying this to COVID-19.
