WEBVTT

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.600
PROFESSOR: So now that we have
a fully parameterized safety

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.760
guideline for indoor
spaces to limit

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.370
the transmission
of COVID-19, we can

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.080
go through some case studies.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.960
And I encourage you
to use the guideline,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.510
in the form of the spreadsheet
or the online app which

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.090
are provided, to check out your
own space to see how you might

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.250
mitigate transmission there.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.650
So here are two
representative examples

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.920
of great interest today.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.700
So the first is a classroom
in the United States, which

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.930
is very relevant for discussions
about closing or reopening

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.380
or partially reopening our
schools during the pandemic.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.660
And the second example will
be that of a nursing home,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.740
which is a tragic situation
of great interest,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.460
because a large fraction--
in fact, almost half--

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.360
of all deaths have occurred
in nursing homes and eldercare

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.430
facilities here in
the United States,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.170
and a very significant
number around the world.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.100
So first, let's look
at the classroom case.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.539
So if we apply the
guideline, first of all,

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.710
we see the typical shape
of what is predicted

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.570
in a plot of occupancy
versus time, which

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.710
is a curve with roughly
a 1 over x type behavior,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.010
because it is the product of
occupancy and time essentially

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.740
that are limited
by the guideline.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.160
So you trade one for the other.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.500
So we have here
curves representing

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.229
natural ventilation,
which we estimate

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.610
to be an air change time of
around 3 per hour-- or 0.3.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.370
Excuse me-- so a
3-hour air change time,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.600
and also mechanical ventilation,
in this case with 8 air changes

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.789
per hour, so reasonably
good mechanical ventilation,

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.710
which is the red curve--

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.350
the blue curve
being the natural.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.880
And this is in a
typical classroom

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.360
space of 900 square feet
and 12-foot-high ceilings,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.410
so for the United States.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.720
And in such spaces,
the typical occupancy

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.240
might be around
20 or 25 students.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.830
And so 20 students is
actually indicated here

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.310
as the normal occupancy
for this space.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.200
And so what we see is
that the normal occupancy

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.060
is safe for a certain
amount of time.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.110
But then eventually,
it becomes unsafe.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.040
And so in the case of lower
ventilation, of course,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.480
that transition
happens more-- sooner.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.940
And if you have
better ventilation,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.160
you can extend that time.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.010
Also in the dotted line here
is shown the transient solution

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.440
in the guideline, which
accounts for the buildup

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.860
of infectious aerosols when
an infected person first

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.910
enters the space.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.320
And you can see
in this case, that

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.950
buys you just a little
bit of extra time only

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.579
in the case of the
natural ventilation,

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.510
but really not much in the
case of mechanical ventilation,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.070
where the transient and
steady state curve essentially

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.720
overlap.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.590
We can also compare this
with some typical official

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.600
guidelines here in the United
States and also elsewhere.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.190
So first, we have
the 6-foot rule.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.140
And what we see is that
after a fairly short time,

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.320
the 6-foot rule becomes
inadequate in the case

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.630
of natural ventilation.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.500
In the case of
mechanical ventilation,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.640
still at some point, the
6-foot rule is unsafe.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.740
However, before that
transition happens,

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.180
it's actually overkill.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.860
So for enforcing
the 6-foot rule,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.380
we are keeping people at
a fairly low density when

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.020
perhaps that's not necessary
for airborne transmission,

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.410
especially if masks
are being worn,

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.630
because that cuts down the
short-range transmission

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.110
and droplet transmission
that we've discussed.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.730
And airborne transmission,
analyzed by the guideline,

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.120
is expected to be the
dominant mode of transmission.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.850
So the way this
plot is made is also

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.780
allowing for rescaling
by the use of masks.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.400
So and also, by--

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.150
so that's the horizontal axis.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.030
So what is plotted here
is the mask-adjusted time,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.970
which is pm squared times tau.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.400
So pm is the masked
transmission factor.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.430
So a very good mask
has pm near 0--

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.070
for example, maybe 0.05 or even
0.01 for a good surgical mask,

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:12.830
maybe 50% or 30% for a
decent cloth face covering.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.120
And so that comes in squared.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.649
And that factor
rescales the time.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.950
So for example, we see
here with ventilation,

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.820
we might expect to get
40 hours in this case

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.910
with the 6-foot rule, or if
we're at normal occupancy,

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.320
maybe 20 hours.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.950
But if we have good masks
that have pm squared maybe

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.840
on the order of 100, let's say,
or even 1,000-- so depending

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.570
on what that value is-- you
see you can turn that 20

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.390
hours into thousands of hours.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.320
And so it actually becomes quite
safe to stay in that space.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.400
Now, on the vertical axis, we
have the occupancy limit scaled

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.770
by epsilon, the risk tolerance.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.730
So what's shown here, then,
is effectively risk tolerance

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.200
of 1, which we would not want.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.270
We don't want any transmissions.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.830
But if you reduce that to
epsilon of 0.1 or even 0.01,

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.500
then you again pick up
a factor of, let's say,

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.150
10 to 100 reduction in
the time or the occupancy.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.150
But again, with masks, that's
offset by a factor which

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.860
is typically larger than that.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.100
So what we're seeing
here is that even

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.580
in a very conservative
viewpoint,

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.010
if we analyze a
classroom space--

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.950
where there by the way is no
filtration or other mitigation

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.610
measures occurring
except for ventilation

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.440
at either of these rates--

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.990
we see that if masks
are worn consistently

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.740
that we should be able
to get tens or even

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.600
hundreds of hours of
shared use of that space,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.730
even at normal occupancy.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.340
Now, how should we
interpret that time?

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.630
So the time could be a
continuous occupancy time.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.760
But especially if we're
looking at the steady state

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.470
value, which is
more conservative

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.780
than the transient,
then we can simply

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.830
add up the cumulative time
that people spend together

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.050
in the presence of
an infected person.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.610
And so if we get
to a number like,

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.530
for example, 40 hours,
which we can easily

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.900
achieve wearing masks
with normal occupancy

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.150
and decent
ventilation, then that

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.150
might correspond to one
week in the classroom

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.650
with an infected person.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.360
That's a very good number,
because the time to symptoms

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.970
is around five or six
days with COVID-19.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.230
Now, of course, some
transitions may be symptomless.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:35.640
But the recovery time is also
on the order of maybe two weeks.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.940
And so if you can stay
during that period of time

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.530
in the presence of
an infected person,

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.070
that infected person
essentially will

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.880
be removed, either by
recovery or by showing

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.310
symptoms and hopefully removing
themselves and going home.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.550
Also, this kind of analysis
can inform testing.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.930
If the guideline
says that you're

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.200
safe for a week or even two
weeks of occupancy, given

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.659
the number of hours per day
and the other conditions,

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:02.870
and the testing frequency is,
let's say, once per week--

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.450
and also we know that the
most infectious time only

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.450
happens after, say, five
or six days after becoming

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.630
infected-- then with weekly
testing and mask use,

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.330
this becomes an
extremely safe situation

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.360
from the perspective of
airborne transmission

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.310
if people are wearing masks
carefully during that time.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.400
So that's one way to think
about these guidelines.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.850
Also, the guideline can tell you
the relative risk improvement

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.340
if you, say,
introduce filtration,

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.620
or you change the
humidity of the room

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.740
or change the ventilation rate
other than values shown here.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.100
And you can play with the
spreadsheet or the online app

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.550
to see how those
changes can take place.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.220
Our next example
is a nursing home.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.280
Now, here, I've-- instead
of scaling to epsilon,

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.740
the risk tolerance, I've
just chosen a risk tolerance

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.430
of 0.01, which is a 1% risk
of transmission if an infected

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.400
person were to enter this space.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.340
You may want to take even a
smaller value, to be even more

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.860
conservative, given
the grave danger

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.190
that persons who
are in nursing homes

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.350
are facing, partly
due to their age

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.210
and also due to the
common situation

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.450
of pre-existing conditions,
given that in many cases,

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.990
there may only be months
or years left of life

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.920
expectancy for those people.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.180
And so they are, in fact, at
the highest risk for COVID-19.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.450
So you want to pick
a very small epsilon.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.520
And so now, if you
look at these curves,

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.809
then you see the horizontal
axis has now changed to minutes.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:38.220
So that's if no one is
wearing a mask, then

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.090
on the order of minutes--

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.289
so something like
the 15-minute rule--

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.220
you can see there becomes
a risk of infection,

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.010
although ventilation can
help and can turn the 15

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.160
minutes, say, into 30 minutes.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.960
If we look at, say,
the 6-foot rule,

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.760
which is shown here,
which would only

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.390
place two people in a
typical nursing home room

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.360
that we have just shown here--
so that would be two beds,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.160
although in some cases, as
in the example shown here,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.650
which is based on New
York City nursing homes,

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.530
the size of the space
that we've assumed here

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.440
would actually have a normal
maximum occupancy of three.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.900
So there could even be
three beds in this space.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.870
And the point is that even if
these beds are 6 feet apart,

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.970
if the people are
not wearing masks--

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.340
or if a person enters the
room, who is infected,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.690
who is not wearing a mask--

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.090
the risk of transmission
is actually very high.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.060
And if people spend
long periods of time

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.850
without masks, as many
nursing home patients must

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.870
do because they have
trouble breathing already--

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.420
so unless they're
on a respirator,

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.620
if they're just kind of
in relatively good shape,

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.540
they will be
breathing oftentimes

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.400
for long periods without masks.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.350
And that can be
a serious problem

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.780
and lead to very high risk.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.240
So the guideline
essentially helps

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.040
to sound the alarm for
those sorts of situations

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:56.610
and helps those facilities and
the caregivers design the space

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.790
and the time spent in the
space with different people

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.700
in a way that can help
to protect the residents,

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:07.500
and also when combined with
testing and other mitigation

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:13.570
measures, can hopefully reduce
the spread of the disease

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:18.890
where it matters the most and
has led to the most deaths.
