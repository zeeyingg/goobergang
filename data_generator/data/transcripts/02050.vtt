00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.150
PROFESSOR: Now,
let's talk briefly

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.590
about different types of
ventilation and different ways

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.510
that they can mix or not
mix the air in a room.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.520
So the first type, which
is what we've mainly

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.160
been talking about, is
so-called mixing ventilation.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.230
So this is when the colder
air is forced from above--

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.700
or in other cases,
the warmer air

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.260
is forced from
below-- in such a way

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.450
that there's an unstable
thermal gradient,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.950
so that the buoyancy forces end
up contributing towards mixing.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.120
And then you can see that
if a person's in the room,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.500
the natural thermal plume rising
around that person of warmer

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.440
air, as well as the
respiratory plume

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.960
sketched here in yellow
from all the breathing--

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.380
both of them are kind of rising
and then well mixed in the room

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.990
before they're finally
removed by the outlet

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.220
of the ventilation.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.530
And so that is the situation
we've been mainly talking

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.630
about of the well-mixed room.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.150
But it's worth considering
that in some other cases,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.510
the ventilation specifically
is set up to reduce mixing.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.710
So especially in rooms
that have high ceilings,

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.760
it can be advantageous to set
up a stratified ambient, where

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.760
the thermal plume from
the body is rising

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.850
as well as the respiratory
plumes and are collecting

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.370
in the upper area of the room
where they're being gently

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.220
sucked out as the colder air is
being pumped in now from below.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.460
So that's actually a
stable thermal gradient.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.430
And so at least
the buoyancy forces

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.900
are not leading to any
large scale convection,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.330
although there certainly are
still boundary layer flows

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.789
and plumes from the people
and from their motion,

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.580
as I have described earlier.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.940
One advantage here is
that if a mask is worn,

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.880
then the respiratory droplets
coming from breathing, which

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.550
are sketched here in
yellow, are kind of

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.030
brought closer to the thermal
plume and forced to rise more.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.590
So it basically causes
the little droplet--

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.130
let's say, the
infectious aerosols

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.440
from the breath
to be more likely

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.850
swept to the upper
reaches, where

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.310
they might sit at the
higher levels of the room

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.930
and then be sucked out.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.090
So that can actually
be a situation

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.920
where a less well-mixed
room can be better.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.579
On the other hand, the
advantage of a well-mixed room

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.980
is that the pathogen
in the droplets

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.240
is diluted throughout
a larger space.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.950
And that can be
more advantageous.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.290
But in any case, this
situation with high ceilings

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.870
and especially with natural
ventilation, where you set up

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.329
a stratified ambient,
is a strategy that's

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.570
been used for a long time.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.110
In fact, Florence
Nightingale, in the 1800s,

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.579
recommended that
hospitals should

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.340
have high ceilings
and good ventilation

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.840
for protection against
airborne pathogens.
