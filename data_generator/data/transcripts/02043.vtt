WEBVTT

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.960
PROFESSOR: So until now, we
based the safety guideline

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.230
on the indoor reproductive
number, which is essentially

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.350
the effective number
of new infections

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.860
from a single infected
person or per infected person

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.030
in the room.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.220
And in many cases, that is the
right variable to think about.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.880
In fact, it's essentially the
most conservative definition

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.070
that allows us to limit
the spread of the disease

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.750
at the level of the population.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.760
If every room were
doing that, we

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.850
would control the
spread of the epidemic.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.660
But we also should think about
the role of the prevalence

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.610
of infection in a given region.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.340
In particular, as the
number of infected people

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.350
in the population
goes up, we should

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.840
be increasing restrictions
to a certain point.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.620
And also, as the
pandemic recedes,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.030
we should then be decreasing
those restrictions.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.640
So there has to be
a role also to be

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.870
played in using the
guideline for the prevalence

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.170
of infection.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.480
So to describe this, let's
think of a random number

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.110
of transmissions
that's going to occur.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.860
So this T here is going
to be the random--

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.280
it's a random
variable, which will

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.410
be the random number
of transmissions

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:31.010
in the room with all the
usual features so in time tau

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.500
and all the other assumptions
about this indoor space

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.460
that we've been talking about.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.160
But the important thing
is that this is random

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.770
because we don't know--

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.150
what we're going
to focus on here

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.440
is we don't know how many
people are in the room.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.330
So there are I infected people.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.560
And I here is the random
number of infected people.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.190
There are S susceptible people,
which also is a random number.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.320
And then there is a
transmission rate, which

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.490
is the expected number of--

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.260
which is the number of--

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.330
random number of
transmissions per pair.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.640
So if you take an infected
person and a central person

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.220
in this time, there's
a certain probability

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.900
of transmission,
which is described

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.050
by this random variable TMN.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.690
And so what we're going
to assume here is--

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.030
I'll just mention some technical
assumptions, first of all,

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:39.270
that this tau or TMN
is a Poisson process

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.380
with a certain mean
rate calculated

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.170
by the previous
model that we've been

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.700
dealing with with a mean
rate beta times tau.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.200
So up to a certain
point in time,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.610
there's an average
transmission rate beta average.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.260
And that's a Poisson process.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.580
So what that actually means
is that the occurrence

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.160
of transmission between
a pair of individuals

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.130
can happen randomly
in the time sequence.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.520
At any infinitesimal time step,
it has no memory of the past.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.590
And it's an independent
random event

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.440
with fairly low probability
in a given small time

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.390
interval but which achieves
this certain random rate here.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.780
So in probability
statistics, we refer

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.520
to that as a Poisson process.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:32.180
We also assume that
each TMN is independent

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:41.110
and identically distributed
Poisson processes.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.360
So in other words, if I take two
different pairs of individuals,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.700
and I consider the transmission,
they're not correlated.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.630
That is an assumption.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.829
Because, of course, if the
infected person is sitting

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.790
in one place, you might
expect the people nearby even,

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.530
say, within six feet might be
more likely to be infected.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.750
We are leaving that out
because we are considering

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.750
airborne transmission in
a well-mixed room where

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.700
this should not be
any such correlations

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.980
as a first approximation.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.730
Furthermore, we assume that
not only each transmission is

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.860
independent but also that
the number of infected people

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.920
I and all these transmissions
are also independent,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.860
are uncorrelated.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.350
So basically, the arrival
of infected people

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.350
is uncorrelated to how
they're transmitting.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.510
So for example, if we have
a pack of infected people

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.350
that arrive, we're not somehow
changing the transmission rate

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.260
to change that.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.560
And that's partly we can make
the assumption because we

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.140
are interested in the limit of
a small number infected people.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.550
In fact, it's
almost always going

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.370
to be 0 or 1 because
the prevalence is not

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.200
going to be that high in
the population generally.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.920
And so we can make
that assumption.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.170
And so if we do that, then
what we're really interested in

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.120
is what is the expected
number of transmissions

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.670
so the expected
value of this T here.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.250
So if you have a random
sum of random variables,

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.000
then the expectation
is easy to calculate.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.720
If also the random number is
independent from the variables

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.060
you're adding up so there's
no correlation between them,

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.480
this would just be the expected
number of the total number

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.030
of those variables,
which is IS, just

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.300
the total number of pairs
infected and susceptible,

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:29.130
times the expected value of this
tau MN, which is beta bar tau.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.670
And just for completeness, let
me also remind you actually

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.090
what this beta bar is just so
that when I keep writing it,

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.840
we're clear on it.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:43.000
It's 1 over tau integral
from 0 to tau of beta dt.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.909
So it's the time average beta.

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.159
And we have further
approximated this

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:52.230
by writing the beta
inverse average

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.920
is approximately the steady
state value inverse times

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.380
1 plus lambda C tau inverse.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.630
So that was a convenient
approximation.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.270
So in our subsequent
calculations,

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.940
whenever you see this expression
average of beta times tau,

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.180
you could imagine substituting
this expression where

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.250
beta bar is given by all
the physical parameters

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.780
that we've been discussing.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.490
So this is a very simple model
of the random transmission that

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.010
can occur when you
take into account

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.010
the randomness in the
number of infected people.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.250
So now let's start to write
down a model for the number

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.090
of iffected people.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.570
So the simplest
thing there is that--

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:39.070
I'll write here the random
number of infected persons

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:46.360
is that this should be a
binomial random variable.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.510
And that means that
the probability

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.770
that the infected number
is equal to some value N

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.030
is the number of ways you can
choose little n infected people

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.840
out of N total people in the
room times the probability

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.200
that any one of them is
infected, which we'll call pI,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.000
and then qI is the probability
that the others are not

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.970
infected.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.940
So the important new variable
that we have here is pI

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:21.430
is the probability a
person randomly selected

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:26.650
from the population and placed
in this room is infected.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.660
And this is also
sometimes called

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.790
the prevalence of the
infection in the population.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.700
And then this qI, of
course, is just 1 minus pI.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.250
So it's standard notation
for binomial distribution

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.140
is to use q is 1 minus p.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.040
And so let's make some
further assumptions

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.230
about this random number
of infected people.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.490
So first of all, by assuming
this binomial distribution,

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.030
we are assuming that
at any moment in time,

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.690
the number of iffected people is
somehow refreshed continuously

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.090
to reflect the same
kind of distribution

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.470
that you find in the population.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:22.990
So the variable I is
refreshed continuously in time

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:29.910
to reflect the
population prevalence.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:36.049
So people are coming
and going from the room.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:38.549
But there's always a certain
number of inffected people

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:41.010
that reflects the chance of
running into an infected person

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:41.909
in the population.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:43.539
So that's a
reasonable assumption.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:46.150
A more sophisticated
model for a given space

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.660
might take into account the
actual probability or rate

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.280
of arrival and the rate
of removal of people

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.620
and, similar to models
from queuing theory,

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.700
might derive a distribution
which is more complicated

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.450
and depends on those
other parameters

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.810
for the fluctuations
in the number

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.250
of infected people in a room.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.990
But this is the
simplest way to start

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.440
is that the room essentially
reflects the population

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.370
statistically.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.620
Another assumption, though,
which we're going to make,

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.950
which gives us some
more simplicity

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.170
and also allows us to
be more conservative,

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:26.730
is that we neglect
exposure and essentially

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:31.100
allow infection to happen at
the same rate more than once

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:45.730
even and allow transmission
to proceed at the same rate

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:51.130
where we essentially are
assuming that S is N minus I.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.800
So in other words,
the susceptibles

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.920
never get converted into
an exposed group that can

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.750
no longer be infected again.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.390
We'll just say that the
rate is still always going

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.920
to be I times S where
S is just N minus I.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.700
So we're letting the number
of infected people fluctuate.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.490
But everyone else in the room
is considered susceptible.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.490
That's a conservative
approximation.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:18.510
Because in reality, the
number of susceptible people

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.110
would go down as they
converted to the exposed Group.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.310
Over very long times,
eventually there

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.130
be new infected
people generated.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.830
But that's really relevant for
situations like the Diamond

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:31.200
Princess quarantine
where same people

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.070
are confined to the same space
for a period, a longer period.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.300
Here, we're really thinking
of just this indoor space that

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:44.320
is reflecting the statistics of
prevalence in the population.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.950
Let me now do a couple
quick calculations based

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.540
on this model of some quantities
that we're going to need.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.340
So the first is that given
a binomial distribution,

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.920
the expected value of
this random variable

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:02.070
I is just the number in the
room times pI the prevalence.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:07.100
And furthermore,
the variance of I,

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.020
which is the expected
value of I squared

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:18.000
minus the expected value of I
quantity squared, is NpIqI--

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.510
basic result for a
binomial random variable.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.300
From there, if you then take
these two relationships,

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.530
you can solve for the
expected value of I squared

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:36.000
and find that that is equal
to this Npq plus the Np

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.240
quantity squared--

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.160
I'll just write that--

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.290
Npq plus Np quantity squared.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.190
That's wrong.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:52.040
And so that's can be written
as I expected value times--

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:52.920
well, let's see here.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:12:01.750
We have a qI plus
expected value of I.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.870
And now using this
relationship, if we

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.790
look at the number
of susceptibles,

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:12.250
S, the expected value, is just
N minus the expected value of I,

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.600
which is Np.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.270
And finally, to
calculate transmissions,

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:21.220
what we're really interested in,
the expected value of I times

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.630
s--

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:26.980
so that would be,
if we substitute,

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.280
that would be N times
the expected value of I

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.680
minus the expected
value of I squared,

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.040
which we have right here.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:40.300
And if we substitute
this expression here,

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.550
you see we have a factor of I--

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.200
expected value that
we can factor out,

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:50.480
and then we get N minus the
expected value I minus q, qI.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.450
And then, finally,
substituting the expected value

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:56.740
of Is and pI, and
1 minus pI is qI,

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:01.930
you can find that
this is pIqI N N

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:07.030
minus 1, which can
also be written

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:12.540
sigma I squared N minus 1.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.900
So now we basically
have an expression

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.430
for the transmission rate in
terms of the number of people

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:21.130
in the room.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.860
So essentially, it's N minus 1,
which, in fact, you may recall,

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.650
was the transmission rate when
there's one infected person

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.980
and N minus 1 susceptibles.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.720
But time is factor
sigma I squared,

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.780
which is actually
the fluctuation

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.530
in the infected number.
