00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.190
JULIAN BEINART: I like
just having you understand

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.290
that if you really want
to understand anything

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.200
about cities, you have
to immerse yourself

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.280
in the vast, vast
amount of material.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.096
Now seriously, it's a joke.

00:00:42.096 --> 00:00:45.255
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.260
The class on Tuesday referred
to a number of theories

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.860
which I didn't have
much time to expand on.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.900
For those of you interested,
the reading on the sheet

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.940
I gave you is available
and worthwhile

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.970
looking at if you're at
all interested in expanding

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.520
beyond what we did on Tuesday.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.550
This is supposed to
be an advanced class.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.810
There's a prerequisite before
you can take this class.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.565
And yet the field is such
that so much of this material

00:01:34.565 --> 00:01:40.820
[INAUDIBLE] is the first
time you've encountered it.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.590
So I work on the
basis of those of you

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.480
who want to pursue more
have available at least

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.760
some direction which to travel.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.360
So the sheet is
really the direction

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.890
in which you might travel if
you want to explore anything

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.280
from [INAUDIBLE] text to
the work of other theorists.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.030
OK, we switch gears
completely now.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.270
We are on to the
serious material.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.170
The first part of this class
is really just to warm you up,

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.730
to make you understand
something about urban history,

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.490
and to give you a
superficial grasp of what

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.250
theories about the form
of cities might mean.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.560
The second part of this
glass deals more meticulously

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.330
with particular items in cities.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.930
It starts off with a review
of industrialization.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.560
Some historians claim that there
have been three momentous times

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.320
in human history--

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.510
something in the
neolithic period,

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.850
something in the post-religion
period of the Enlightenment,

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.150
and the Industrial Revolution.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.610
Nothing in my mind contests
with the Industrial Revolution.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:32.740
And in a sense, except
for your own education,

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.870
anything prior to the
period from 1750 onwards

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.770
is irrelevant.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.690
I know it's a stupid thing
to say but I'll say it again.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.840
From this class' point of
view, we start at 1750.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.220
And today, we will
try to understand

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.190
a very complex
phenomenon, the phenomenon

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:04.480
[INAUDIBLE] which
increased almost

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.780
every aspect of human life,
particularly in England.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.086
Why in England?

00:04:11.086 --> 00:04:14.830
[HEAVY SIGH] Enough
theorists have tried

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.344
to understand why in England.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.100
I referred you in the
reading to a book by--

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.400
a recent book by
a man called Clark

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.080
from the West Coast university,
University of California

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.030
in Davis, I think.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.820
The book is called
A Farewell to Arms.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.500
Did you find any interesting
ideas in that book?

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.125
Let me explain.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.120
The Industrial
Revolution, as I was

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.790
confronted with it is
a high school student

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.630
and then at
university, was a set

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.300
of events by
people, individuals,

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:17.430
who transformed the built
world, from Telford in Newcastle

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.115
using steel to--

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:29.580
not Telford-- sorry, Stephenson
in Newcastle, learning how to--

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.070
teaching us how to
industrialize the railroad.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:44.820
McAdam, from which we
learn how to pave roads.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.760
From 1901, the first
British census,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.400
we learned the value of
establishing a uniform system

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.910
for counting how many
people are in the nation.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.400
The penny postage stamp--

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:06.540
the first stamp which
allowed communication by mail

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.970
in a systematic manner, and so
on and on and on and on and on

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.040
and on and on.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.650
Nobody explains why it happened.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.740
The theory is the
genius of human beings

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:29.160
all lumped together changed
the British landscape.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.100
However, we can't be that naive.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.520
We have to ask ourselves
deeper questions,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.880
because these
changes are serious

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.610
and affected the world
in significant ways.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:56.000
Clark's book argues
that, in a crude sense,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.100
the world in England in 1200
was a world securing property,

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:12.680
free trade, all of the
basic economic conditions

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:19.860
which initiative
could take place.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.310
In fact, [INAUDIBLE] a table
in the book, if you ever

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:31.780
read the book, which compares
1200 England with 2000 England

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:38.230
and shows the metaconditions
were the same.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.670
What he argues of, which
is novel in this argument

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:49.230
about the Industrial
Revolution, that there

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:54.060
was a transmission, either
culturally or biogenetically,

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:59.880
from the wealthy, who
had bigger families

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:06.150
and who lived longer,
through a downward mobility

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.190
to the rest of the population.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:18.190
And he cites a
number of conditions,

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:27.910
having examined the wills
of people from 1200 to 1800.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:32.780
He derives a number
of conclusions--

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:38.789
that the world changed
for the people en masse.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.890
Interest rates fell.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.530
Murder rates declined.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.120
Work hours increased.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.870
Taste for violence declined.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:00.930
Education spread to
the lower classes.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.640
And savings increased.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.340
In the handout today,
I gave you a review.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.340
There have been many
reviews of this book--

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.170
some arguing with it,
some saying it's nonsense,

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.900
some saying it has some basis.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:22.200
But Clark has not concluded
that it's biogenetic or cultural

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.370
or how the transmission
actually took place.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.450
What is powerful about his
argument is that it's new.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.230
It's fresh.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:41.875
It's much more vigorous
than previous examples.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.995
The taste for violence declined.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:10:02.990
In 1851, boxing was
conditioned by weight.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.230
In medieval boxing,
a big man seven

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.360
foot tall, boxed
somebody three foot tall.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.184
And everybody laughed.

00:10:14.184 --> 00:10:19.940
[LAUGHTER] I will cite you,
when we talk about Paris,

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:24.545
about the burning of cats in
public space to amuse people.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.970
The tradition of beating up
animals through cockfighting,

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:38.450
bullfighting, and so
on declined and was

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:42.740
replaced by a rationalized
form of sport.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:47.450
Manchester United was
formed as a club in 1878.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.470
Today it's the wealthiest
sporting franchise

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.930
in the world.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:58.640
Manchester, where Engels wrote
The Condition of the Working

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.630
Class in England, was hardly
the site, according to Engels,

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:07.610
for the emergence of a $100
billion sports franchise.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.465
Taste for violence declined.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:25.840
How do you explain how a
taste for violence can be--

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.810
this country, at the
moment, is engaged

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.690
in trying to deal with
what we could only

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:38.240
call a culture of violence,
in which violence seems

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.160
to be built into the
grain of the society

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
in a way which is
difficult to understand

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.260
and difficult to
do something about.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.500
How do these changes take place?

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.600
And how aware were
those of us who

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.760
were preoccupied with
making decisions for people

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.370
about the cities they live in?

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.960
How do we understand
these cultural shifts?

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.700
I grew up as a modernist.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.460
When I look at the work
I did as a student,

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:20.130
both in architecture and in
city planning, I'm embarrassed.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.360
The culture in
which I worked was

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.250
very different from the
one in which you work now.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.410
We can only understand--

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.200
and I'm not going
to deal extensively

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.250
with societal changes in
this period in England.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.430
I'm only going to
deal with them when

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:50.730
they affect some notion about
the built form of places.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:55.600
Otherwise, we'd be here, and
I'm incompetent to give you

00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:01.700
a very good background in
19th century English history.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.330
I'm just going to pick
on certain coincidences

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:05.650
and events.

00:13:14.144 --> 00:13:23.310
For instance, Peterloo was
a gathering of protesters

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.610
in Liverpool, I
think it was, just

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:30.660
after the British won the
great battle against Napoleon

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.970
in Waterloo.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:40.130
11 Englishmen were killed by
the police and the military.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:48.270
152 years later, 13 Englishmen--
actually, Catholic Irish--

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:52.020
were killed by the British
police and military.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:57.780
Over a period of 152 years of
this incredible transformation

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.320
of the society, the British
police and the military

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.860
didn't kill more
than 11 or 13 people.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:09.925
It's a remarkable story.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:17.410
And in it the origins
of Marxist thought

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:22.090
fits quite neatly, which I will
talk a bit about later when we

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.980
deal with Engels in Manchester.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.670
Clark makes a big story
about the Malthusian trap.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:40.350
Malthus wrote a book in 1798--

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.670
I forget the title.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:42.940
I used to know the title.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.770
Does anybody know the
title of Malthus' book?

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:47.520
AUDIENCE: The dismal
science [INAUDIBLE]??

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.478
JULIAN BEINART: No, no.

00:14:48.478 --> 00:14:52.560
That's what it was
called by critics.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.770
It's something about
the population.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:02.940
Essentially, the Malthusian
trap, Clark argues,

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.630
is that, until the
Industrial Revolution,

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:11.220
the amount of food that would
be produced in a society

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.360
or in a city or in a village
was equal to the amount

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.660
of population that could be fed.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:26.070
If there was an innovation
in the society's production,

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:30.210
incomes rose, but the
population stayed the same

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:35.490
because the food
supply wasn't enlarged.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:42.540
Malthus in 1798m as I will
show you in the graph,

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.560
observed the most rapid
change in percentage

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.060
of population increase
that Britain had ever seen.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:56.160
Manchester was increasing in
population by 10% per annum,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:02.940
whereas European birth rates or
growth rates, population growth

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.740
rates, largely
because of disease

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:11.085
over the medieval period,
averaged about 0.6% or 1%.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:22.990
Trevelyan, one of the great
British historians, I quote--

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.410
"The survival of many more
infants and the prolongation

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.740
of the average age of adults
marks off modern times

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.060
from the past.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:36.900
And this change begins
in the 19th century."

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:42.840
Two phenomenon-- death
rate, people live longer,

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.840
and more children survive.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.840
Put those two together, and
you have the fundamentals

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.320
of population growth.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:06.170
In 1500, London's population
was between 40,000 and 60,000

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:07.910
people.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:14.210
Paris was already had a
population of about 200,000.

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:20.210
So London was almost the
second great European city.

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:25.280
By 1851 or 1850, it was the
largest city in the world,

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.120
with an estimated population of
2 to 2 and 1/2 million people.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:40.030
1851 is the signal date in
the 19th century for us.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:45.530
What happened in 1851,
or around about 1850?

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:49.040
The most significant
building of the 19th century

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:54.680
was built in London,
the Crystal Palace.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.820
Who is the chairman
of the committee?

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.256
And who built the
Crystal Palace?

00:18:01.256 --> 00:18:02.960
AUDIENCE: It was Paxton, right?

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.970
JULIAN BEINART: Paxton was
chosen by James Cubitt.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:12.380
Cubitt was the first
Industrial builder.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:17.570
Instead of using medieval
feudal labor, journeymen,

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:21.230
on a daily basis, he
employed up to 1,000 people

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.230
on permanent salaries.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:29.780
He believed, like many of
these progressive individuals,

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:34.310
that architects were
second rate and [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:39.440
in their behavior.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.690
Cubitt, for instance,
advised the queen,

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:45.860
who wanted to develop a large
part of the Isle of Wight,

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:48.170
I think it was, if I'm correct.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.210
I'm trying to remember.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.770
He said, don't use architects.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.720
They just waste your time.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.290
Baron Haussmann in Paris
did exactly the same thing.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:14.110
1850-- England was,
for the first time,

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:19.060
divided into 50% of the
population living in cities

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.746
and 50% living in rural area.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:39.550
A trivial event, the invention
of camera processing,

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:43.600
the capacity to
photograph, to make

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.915
recordings of the built world--

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.680
the conquering of disease.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:16.200
In 1854, a physician
in London decided

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:22.380
that cholera, which is the most
prevalent and most dangerous

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:28.470
of urban diseases, was not born
in the air but was water borne.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:35.280
These are pieces we are
reading for next Tuesday, which

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.690
deals with this, and
followed by the biggest

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:46.380
piece of infrastructure
yet built in the world to--

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:51.240
imagine living in [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:56.130
Manchester in 1830,
the city couldn't

00:20:56.130 --> 00:21:01.320
get people, municipal workers,
to go into their houses.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.310
They had to open the windows
first, break the windows

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.100
to let in fresh air.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:13.470
The British parliament had
to be stopped one summer

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:16.010
because the smell was so bad.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:21.600
London rivers was so polluted,
all the garbage and sewage

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.680
and feces produced
by the English

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.100
in London, in a city of two
million people, went straight

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.990
into the river.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:35.280
People made a living picking
up bones in the river.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.190
This is the first chapter
of the book called The Ghost

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:43.560
Map, which deals with the
invention of the cholera

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.120
phenomenon--

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.070
not the invention
of the phenomenon,

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:50.100
the invention of the cure--

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:55.500
which details that
concept of life in London.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:08.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] started
to compare [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.440
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah, he did he
did a kind of Sherlock Holmes

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:11.940
thing--

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.440
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.500
JULIAN BEINART:
--taking random clues.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:22.320
When somebody died, the
family would say, oh,

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.773
we drank something last night.

00:22:24.773 --> 00:22:26.190
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
he would track it.

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:27.690
JULIAN BEINART: And
he would track--

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:32.560
and he tracked it to the
central water fountain.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.860
Remember that the British
had no sewage system.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.440
So if you went to the toilet--

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.120
for a long time, the British--

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.360
at the Crystal
Palace, they invented,

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.530
or produced for the first
time, the toilet seat.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.810
But the British
bought the toilet seat

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.900
but didn't understand that,
if you used the toilet seat,

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:56.850
something would happen to
the material you produced.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:58.830
It's an extraordinary
phenomenon.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:11.280
Let me just draw
these two graphs.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:32.240
1700 to 1750, 1750 to 1800,
1800 to 1850, 1850 to 1900--

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.480
these are 50-year intervals--

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:45.950
1900 to 1950.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:24:00.790
This is 100%, 50%, 100%--

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:13.360
1850, 50%, 33%.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:28.940
1798-- Malthus' observations
are at the peak period

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.360
of the population increase.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.420
So therefore, his conclusion
that the Malthusian trap

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:40.370
would still continue
was totally eviscerated

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.605
by the industrial process.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:57.280
What explains this phenomenon,
the decrease in the rate

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.510
of population growth?

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.820
The graph shows two lines--

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:09.140
one ascending very rapidly,
one descending not quite as

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.820
rapidly, but rapidly.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:24.970
This is explained by a theory
called demographic transition.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:29.860
As you urbanize, you
have fewer children.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.790
There are more costs involved
in producing and maintaining

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:35.380
a large family.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.470
And typically,
populations once they

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:43.420
have achieved their maximum
through the migration of rural

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:50.290
to urban, as the population
now is largely urbanized--

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:54.430
or 50%, at least, is urbanized--

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:55.930
the population will drop.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:51.990
1800, 1950, 1850, 1900--

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:58.320
1800, three quarters of the
country is agricultural.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.470
1900, half is agricultural.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:06.330
One quarter is agricultural,
and then a small addition

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:07.800
to make it about 70%--

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:15.030
80% urbanized.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:27.850
These phenomena, in
different variations,

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:30.295
occur at the moment.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:40.970
Population growth in Russia
projected for the next 50 years

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:42.020
is minus 25%.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:53.030
Population growth for
Western Africa is plus 122%;

00:27:53.030 --> 00:28:01.160
Middle Africa, 175%;
Japan, minus 13%;

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:07.070
as you move from Russia towards
the West, Central Europe,

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:09.880
Western Europe, minus 0.2%.

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:20.640
It used to be that
planners believe

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.630
that if you wish to
decrease population growth,

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:27.530
you should urbanize
people, that urbanization

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:33.290
was the fastest non-lethal
method of ensuring population

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:34.466
maintenance.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:48.890
It's all a theoretical
posture prior

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:52.760
to cities being as large
as 20 million people

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:58.670
and also prior to the
growth of population

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:04.310
being limited now to people
who are in the absolute poverty

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.170
state.

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:07.730
So you have a combination of--

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:20.370
in a sense, you could argue
that, demographically,

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:27.150
when people have reached the
maximum point of urbanization,

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:33.900
and the family sizes
decrease, population can only

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.720
increase by virtue
of an increase

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:41.100
of that group of people,
which is largely possible

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.210
due to immigration.

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:47.460
So the more the economy is
advanced, the more likely

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:54.240
it is that immigration will
replace work and increase

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.830
population.

00:29:55.830 --> 00:30:00.450
I don't know what the
percentage of immigration

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:03.180
is in America's
population growth,

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:08.550
but it certainly must account
for a significant amount,

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:12.090
because these projections
for the United States

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:16.290
are plus 33% over
the next 50 years.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:19.260
Now, these are
guesses, but they're

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:23.010
better guesses than most people,
the guesses by the United

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:27.340
Nations, who employ a fairly
respectable group of people.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:39.740
OK, why do people shift from
the rural areas of the country

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.032
to its urban areas?

00:30:42.032 --> 00:30:44.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.980
JULIAN BEINART: Hm?

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:46.520
Sorry.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.304
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] jobs.

00:30:48.304 --> 00:30:50.090
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:52.820
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.540
But that presumes there's
no work where they are--

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.210
better work.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:02.070
And better work implies
a number of things.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:06.080
It implies what's being called
by demographers the life

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.720
lottery, that you
stand to higher

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:13.490
random chance of
producing good things

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:17.220
or being recognized than
you do in the country.

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:22.410
The second is the capacity of
the country to support you.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:25.820
There are always two phenomenon.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:29.390
Land reform has been one of
the more difficult aspects

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:34.175
of urban, rural change.

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:40.990
In South Africa, if I remember
the statistics correctly,

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:47.120
although 80% of the
people are Black,

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:52.250
of the population are Black,
or 70% to 80%, less than 20%

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:57.140
of the agricultural land
is owned by Black people.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:01.310
You can see what happens,
what traumatic events happened

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:09.800
in Zimbabwe, when Mugabe
tries to manufacture

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:15.990
the removal of people from
the land in order to--

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:17.945
it happens to be white people.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:26.880
South Africa is on the way to
increasing the amount of land

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:33.130
and operated by
its Black people.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:38.370
But one of the
significant events--

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:40.410
and I think there's
a sheet which

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:44.040
covers this in your reading--

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.540
is the Enclosure Acts.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:33:02.280
The Enclosure Acts
eliminated the possibility

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:07.290
of poor people,
rural populations,

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:10.890
having access to commons land.

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:15.060
At the time of the
census in 1086,

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:19.650
more than half the arable
land belonged to the villages.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:24.432
Enclosure, by redefining
land as property--

00:33:24.432 --> 00:33:30.960
the Enclosure Acts from the 15th
to the 19th century, enclosed

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.050
commons lands and
made it into property.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:41.490
Between the 14th and 16th
century, thousands of residents

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.560
were evicted from their
holdings when many more

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.300
saw the common land that were
the basis of their independence

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.665
fenced off for sheep.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:55.910
Raymond Williams' book
The Country and the City

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:58.460
examines this phenomenon.

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:03.860
In 1873, half the country was
owned by some 7,000 people

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:08.719
in a rural population
of around 10 million.

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:12.139
The capitalism of the
Manchester has been built

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:14.630
on an agrarian capitalism.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:19.010
In the 18th century,
half the cultivated land

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:22.520
was owned by 5,000
families, nearly a quarter

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.765
by 400 families.

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:33.540
Now, you can argue
that modern farming

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:37.050
needed more land in
the subdivision of land

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:38.695
into common parcels.

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:47.010
But there's a rejoicing
about the profit of making--

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:54.310
converting common
land into property.

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:59.290
Philip Sidney, the
poet, writes about--

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:03.910
the term Arcadianism refers
to a Utopian condition

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:06.430
in English literature.

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:14.830
Arcadia is invented as some sort
of alternative world of wonder,

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:18.400
largely because of nature.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:23.260
Philip Sidney invented
the term Arcadianism

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:28.960
in a part which was made as
a result of the enclosure

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.280
of the commons land.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:46.770
So on the one hand, if
one simplifies the story,

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:51.930
one suggests that the
conditions of the poor

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:57.180
were exacerbated by the
removal of their rights to land

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:00.780
and was one of the
phenomenon which

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:05.610
caused them to move
involuntarily to cities.

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:09.600
Now, whether this is absolutely
true or not, I don't know.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.230
Economic historians start
dividing themselves up

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:16.080
into capitalist-oriented
historians

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.510
and labor-oriented historians.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:21.780
And you can take
your pick as to who.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.420
But the notion
that land becomes--

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:30.150
that land is available to
the population is changed

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:34.650
to property has
severe implications

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:40.230
which Engels, in his writing
about Manchester, observes.

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:45.660
He says there are changes in
the social structure of families

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:50.490
once they move into
the factory system.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:53.700
These are not
voluntary labor moves.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:58.560
Engels claims that
the capitalists

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:03.600
keep people in an
insecure state by not

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:10.150
making them have available
alternatives to their jobs.

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:12.990
They don't have
security of jobs anyway.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:18.495
And so therefore, they
abide by low wages.

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:25.460
Manchester, which I'll
deal with in some detail,

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:30.060
largely through the
writing of Engels,

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:35.980
became the most important
example of this manifestation,

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:45.810
the conjunction of rationalized
labor in factory production

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:50.010
and the deterioration
of social circumstances

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:55.680
beyond which the world had
not ever experienced before.

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:06.000
James Joyce wrote a
collection of essays

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.690
called The Dubliners in
which one of the essays

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:14.510
is called "The Dead,"
which was made into a film.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:16.290
I don't know-- I
don't remember--

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:18.480
Joseph Cotten, I
think, was in the film.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.290
I'm not sure.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:30.480
The situation is such--

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.790
in the story,
there's a young man

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:35.520
who decides to leave Dublin.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:40.560
Nobody can understand why
he wants to leave Dublin.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:45.060
He says the only way to get
out of Dublin, as Dublin

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:48.720
is totally controlled
by religion

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.440
and by social
pressure, is to drink.

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:58.140
Irish drink because they can--

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.900
only where they can
liberate themselves

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:06.460
from the compulsion of
their circumstances.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.520
This man is
considered to be dead,

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.540
but he's actually very
alive in making the decision

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.120
to move out of the society.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.252
It took an Irishman
like Joyce to see the--

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:25.870
use this as ammunition.

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:27.930
I'm just jumping
all over the place.

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:36.080
Let's go on, because
there a number of things

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.835
I want to touch in more detail.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.140
I gave you Leo
Huberman's subdivision

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:53.635
of the nature of manufacturing,
from the household or family

00:39:53.635 --> 00:39:54.135
system--

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:59.330
it's there, is it?

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:01.760
I'm not sure what I
hand out every time.

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:16.380
It starts off with a
household or family system.

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.350
AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:18.142
JULIAN BEINART: OK.

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:29.840
This is a construction of
the move from a system where

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.450
you produce in your own
house for your own use,

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:33.520
not for sale--

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.435
there's no work for
an outside market--

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.520
all the way to the Guild
system, where there's

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:44.090
a small stable outside market.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:46.500
Workers own their own
materials and tools.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.590
They sell their products,
not their labor.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:59.610
Up to the early Middle
Ages, space in the house

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:02.760
was undifferentiated.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:06.150
In Henry Fielding's
18th century novel

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:11.970
Tom Jones, which was
also made into a movie,

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:16.800
you see the behavior of a
family and the journeymen

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.190
who come and work and have
sex with the young women

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:22.440
in the attic.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:26.850
There's a whole
bodily kind of scene.

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:28.620
People eat together.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:33.180
Production and eating and
sex and families and children

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:38.505
are all maintained in the
same ensemble of interest.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.490
The guild system
runs into trouble

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:53.230
in the 19th century with the
emergence of a factory system,

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:57.400
where production now is for
a fluctuating outside market,

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.160
carried out in the
employer's buildings.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.640
Workers own neither
raw material nor tools,

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.200
and capital is needed.

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:14.680
The mortgage system, as I
will explain to you next week,

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.890
emanates from, at the
time of the transition,

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:23.140
from the fluctuating building
guild to the permanent building

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.305
society.

00:42:24.305 --> 00:42:27.820
Those of you who live in
India and in South Africa

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:31.240
know that you borrow money,
still today, from the building

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:35.080
society, not from a bank.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.225
Is this true in India?

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:41.860
OK.

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:44.720
I thought so.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:49.960
What happened with the
temporary building--

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:55.410
the building guild is that,
as the middle class emerged

00:42:55.410 --> 00:43:02.320
and became an enormous
clientele for housing,

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:07.270
they transformed their
identity from simply making

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:13.060
houses for themselves or for
the guild to becoming virtually

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:17.230
a bank for housing.

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:20.710
They invented the
mortgage system,

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:25.870
which according to
housing historians,

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:30.400
was as fundamental an
invention as the steam engine

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.100
in the 19th century England.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.110
The genius of the
mortgage system

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:43.060
is that you pay off the interest
before you pay off the capital.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:49.030
The availability of loans
in the United States

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:53.620
prior to later use of
the mortgage system

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:57.460
meant that you could borrow
money wither in a balloon

00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.545
loan or a standard loan.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.950
You borrow money of $100,000.

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:09.160
You go away for 20 years, and
you come back and say, here's

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.380
the $100,000.

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:16.900
By that time, the interest is
made it increased to $300,000,

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:21.670
and you haven't got the $200,000
you need to pay off your loan.

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:25.090
Some people argue
that this is one

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:29.710
of the fundamental reasons
for the Great Depression

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:47.520
in the United States in 1930s.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.530
You have to also
understand, I think,

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:52.710
the transference,
or the invention,

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:54.690
of the idea of capital.

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:58.155
According to Engels, capital
is the unpaid labor of others.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:08.040
In a simple experiment, those
of you who are architects

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:13.200
are not going to be able to
make much money in your life

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:18.570
if you use your own
skills by yourself.

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:20.880
As soon as you
employ others, you

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:25.410
pay them less than they deserve
or less than they produce,

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:27.180
and you skim off the profit.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:27.870
That's capital.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:35.835
I'll repeat Engels-- capital
is the unpaid labor of others.

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:46.210
So capital, in a sense, is a new
creation in the factory system

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:49.600
and identified by
Marx and Engels--

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.635
Marx more than Engels,
in Das Kapital.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.755
So much for the change in labor.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:10.395
I mentioned the
transformation of industry.

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:19.930
None of these economic
historians connect

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:25.240
the invention of mass-produced
iron or the various shuttles

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:31.810
and steam power they
used to produce cotton

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:36.920
or to manufacture
cotton, process cotton--

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:41.470
with science.

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:43.590
I don't know who's
written about the fact

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:47.580
that people were operating
on scientific principles,

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.910
new scientific principles,
introducing these.

00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:57.845
Let's see.

00:46:57.845 --> 00:46:58.720
I'd rather get onto--

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:09.730
by around 1825, while
England had only 2%

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:12.280
of the world's
population, the volume

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.410
of production in
English ironworks

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:16.950
was equal to that of all
the rest of the world.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:27.980
Iron was always a
material resistant to--

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:34.340
copper and bronze, in human
tool development, preceded iron.

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:40.250
Iron was always difficult
to work with until somebody

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:44.960
thought about using
coal in relation to iron

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.420
and eventually producing steel.

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:50.360
Iron with a hopeless commodity.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:57.188
Cast iron, pig iron wasn't
capable of much capacity

00:47:57.188 --> 00:47:58.230
in the building industry.

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.290
Let's move on to another cycle.

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:35.140
One of the dictums the invention
of 19th century Marxism,

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:39.700
which took place largely
in England, with Engels

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:44.770
at age of 24 in
Manchester and Karl Marx

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:48.580
living it up in London,
supported partly

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:50.350
by Engels from Manchester--

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.720
both of whom were German--

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:58.240
Karl Marx a German Jew.

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:06.250
Friedrich Engels was younger but
the son of a merchant, cotton

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:08.670
merchant, in the Ruhr.

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:20.440
Well, after Marx was
banished to England,

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:24.700
he set about constructing
a philosophical structure

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:27.325
of what he thought would be--

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:39.110
what he thought was a
version of the Hegelian idea

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:44.350
that history is not
linear, but history

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:51.010
is composed of a dialectic in
which one state is confronted

00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:52.210
by its opposition.

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:54.490
And then a synthesis
occurs, which

00:49:54.490 --> 00:50:01.050
moves which moves
rationally towards freedom.

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:06.273
God alone knows that's a cross
explanation of Hegelianism.

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:13.470
What Marx didn't
have, although he

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:18.870
read The London Times every day
and studied the stock market,

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:26.190
didn't have the facts
of the case facts.

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:27.720
Marx was a bit of a snob.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:32.590
He sent his kids, his daughters,
to private school in London.

00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:40.150
He never earned a penny
himself, but was a man

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:42.400
who sat in the British Library.

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:47.290
I had a friend, an old man, who
worked in the British Library.

00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:50.620
And one day, he went
to a retirement parity

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:54.280
for one of the guards.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:57.370
And he asked this guard if he
remembered a man with a beard

00:50:57.370 --> 00:50:59.470
who sat in the corner.

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:02.440
And he said, oh, yes, I
wonder what became of him.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:05.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:09.445
Engels, at the age of 24, was--

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:17.950
both of them had been under
the influence of Hegel.

00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:23.140
Hegel was first--
was a professor

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:27.850
in a rural university.

00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:30.010
But then for a
short period of time

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:35.710
was given a chair at Berlin
because his philosophy was not

00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:41.620
considered to be
dangerous to the regime

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:46.870
of the Prussian kings.

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:53.030
Engels provided them with
the data that they needed.

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:56.090
Marx talks about
facts, facts, facts.

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:04.720
Engels arrived in Manchester
because his family

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:10.600
had share in a cotton
produce manufacturing

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.450
operation in the city.

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:26.280
Engels' reaction to what he saw
in Manchester was multifold.

00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:32.380
He liked the good life.

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:35.010
He drank Chateau Margaux.

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:38.040
He ate lobster salad.

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:42.510
He belonged to the
Manchester Royal Exchange.

00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:46.110
He went foxhunting.

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:49.070
He accepted the life of a--

00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:58.140
he liked expensive
women, on the one hand.

00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:01.500
On the other hand,
he was curious

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:05.730
about the world in which
he suddenly found himself.

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:10.450
He had an association
with Elizabeth Burns,

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:16.200
an illiterate Irish woman
whom he walked around

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:18.990
and asked her
questions about why

00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:22.560
the world was the way it was--

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:26.880
extraordinary for
a young man of 24

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:29.250
to produce probably
the most important book

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:30.620
of housing ever written.

00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:35.450
He would ask her
question such as,

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:41.350
why does the main road not
run to the slum that we're in?

00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:45.890
And she would say, because
they don't want to see us--

00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:50.180
the whole idea of critical
distance, the phenomenon

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:54.200
of putting people and
pathways out of the way

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:59.030
of where other people
of another kind live.

00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:01.880
You could take
the plan of a city

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:06.320
and demarcate its roads in
terms of critical distance.

00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:17.750
Nobody goes through Mattapan
to get anywhere else in Boston

00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:19.745
unless you live in
Mattapan itself.

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:25.385
No roads run through Roxbury.

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:34.460
Robert Moses created
the pathways of it

00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:40.330
in the book on Moses.

00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:44.540
The frontispiece-- there's
a map of Moses' road systems

00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:46.385
evading the property
of the wealthy.

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.865
He would ask her why--

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.710
all kinds of questions.

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:02.960
I'm just drifting
off to some of them.

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:20.430
He writes about health.

00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:25.470
50% of children
born in Manchester

00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:31.110
died, either in
childbirth or as infant.

00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:36.520
He says, why do
people live this way?

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:42.340
And the answers are we have
no other opportunities.

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:46.240
He says, why are you kept in
such a state of insecurity?

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:50.080
You don't have permanent jobs.

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:57.310
Why do you work at work
which alienates you?

00:55:57.310 --> 00:56:00.800
You have to go to work at
6 o'clock in the morning.

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:01.840
The bell rings.

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:05.260
If you're late by
five minutes, your pay

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:10.720
is taken away, and
so on and so on.

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:14.470
Why are you supervised
in everything you do.

00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:19.900
And then they say, well, that's
what the factory system is.

00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:22.720
Why are you-- and so on.

00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:28.990
Engels writes, I've never
seen such a social class,

00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:32.030
seen a social class
so deeply demoralized

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:34.000
as the middle class.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.490
They know no happiness
except quick profit.

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:47.500
Marxist philosophy
needed the establishment,

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:50.250
the factual
establishment of Engels'

00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:52.830
writing about
Manchester in order

00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:58.680
to deliver a philosophy,
which Engels had something

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:04.980
to do with, and propagating
it in Europe until he

00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:08.845
died at the age of 75, close
to the end of the century.

00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:31.060
Manchester was-- the
historical dialectic of Hegel

00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:34.750
didn't specify what the final
condition of the dialectic

00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:35.980
would be.

00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:37.375
It simply said freedom.

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:43.250
There was no
instruction in Hegel

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:47.935
that it would end up in a state
devoted to egalitarianism.

00:57:52.110 --> 00:57:55.200
Engels and Marx did this change.

00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:58.440
They did something else.

00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:02.010
They didn't consider
the British capable

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:08.100
of moving to the
justification to the--

00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:11.910
they didn't consider
the British capable

00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:19.020
of doing the changes that need
to be done to make Manchester

00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:24.120
a relic, historical relic.

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:27.150
They were too slow.

00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:30.480
There was a British
countermovement all the time.

00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:34.590
The Chartist movement
was considered by Engels

00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:38.250
to be not radical enough.

00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:44.310
He and Marx decided after
1848 that revolution

00:58:44.310 --> 00:58:47.850
was the only way to
transform society

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:50.490
according to the
Hegel philosophy,

00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:52.860
that it needed to be abrupt.

00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:57.280
And the 1917, 1918
revolution in Russia

00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:03.690
was, in fact, the apotheosis
of this philosophy.

00:59:03.690 --> 00:59:14.270
In England, as I said 20
minutes ago, it took time.

00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:17.585
The Chartist movement was
a working class movement

00:59:17.585 --> 00:59:20.810
which asked only for people--

00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:24.110
males to vote,
not women to vote.

00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:29.120
They were asked for minor
securities in jobs and so on.

00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:31.760
The English version
of the Socialist Party

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:42.770
only started gaining political
strength as the years went on.

00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:55.650
But by 1902, the English had a
Town and Country Planning Act.

00:59:55.650 --> 01:00:07.370
And many of the anticipated
conditions of Manchester

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:11.360
had been alleviated in part.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:16.610
There's some question,
again, as to how much or not.

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:23.765
Manchester was the site
of some other events.

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:42.610
Let me just-- a woman called
Ann Lee worked 14 hours a day

01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:46.000
in a cotton mill as a child.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.030
Her first three
children died in infamy.

01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:51.310
The fourth was
stillborn, and, quote,

01:00:51.310 --> 01:00:53.500
"as she lay in the
agony of delivery

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:57.790
for hours, screaming that
sexual intercourse was the cause

01:00:57.790 --> 01:01:00.760
of all the world's evil."

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.110
What happened to Ann Lee?

01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:13.000
Why's Ann Lee-- why do I
mention Ann Lee's name?

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.100
She left for New York in 1774.

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:20.600
What did she do?

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.555
Hm?

01:01:21.555 --> 01:01:22.920
AUDIENCE: Shakers?

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.600
JULIAN BEINART: Yes.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.510
Yes, yes, yes, yes, of course.

01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:30.750
Sexual intercourse,
being infamy,

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:35.490
would lead to a resistant
community such as Shakers,

01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:38.040
which only shook your hand.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:42.090
That's the closest you came
to another body, at least

01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:44.385
another body of
the opposite sex.

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:51.930
Yes, Ann Lee left London for
New York in '74 to lead the--

01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:55.760
invent the Shakers movement.

01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:01.280
In 1789, 15 years later, a young
Welshman who was 18 years old,

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:05.570
Robert Owen, borrowed 100
pounds and went into the cotton

01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:08.600
business in Manchester.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:13.130
He later went to New Lanark
in Scotland at the age of 28

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:13.850
from the USA.

01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:16.980
He was the first socialist
leader in Great Britain

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:21.500
and the leader of the first
short-lived national trade

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.550
union--

01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:25.040
also from Manchester.

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:32.720
I suppose, at any
point in human history,

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:38.540
there's a place which
is important enough

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:41.600
to change the world.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:44.600
Manchester was that in 1830.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:51.230
And Friedrich Engels fell
upon Manchester by accident.

01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:53.540
It transformed him.

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:56.750
It transformed many
parts of the world.

01:02:56.750 --> 01:03:02.615
And Manchester was the--

01:03:06.027 --> 01:03:08.190
I'm just worried about time.

01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:10.120
There's so many
pieces to this story.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:20.880
The story of this
part of urbanization

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:27.220
can also be told as the story
of the encounter with disease.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:35.610
I mean, 200 million people
died of the plague in Europe.

01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:39.720
The Black Death which killed
a third of the population

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:53.890
of Europe enters
our story of London

01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:56.780
when we deal with
London on Tuesday.

01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:04.150
In 1666, one of the
people I will feature

01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:08.050
dies of the plague, dies
intestate in these--

01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:13.430
we'll tell that
story on Monday--

01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.985
on Tuesday.

01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:22.190
The correlation between
health and disease,

01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:26.390
between health and the
improvement against disease,

01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:29.670
is interesting.

01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:34.050
When cholera threatened in 1832,
cities like New York, Boston,

01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:36.210
New Haven, New York,
and Philadelphia

01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:40.560
still had pigs roaming
the streets, in 1832.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.300
Sewage flowed in open
ditches along major arteries.

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:49.170
Mud and ice plagued
unpaved streets.

01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:54.410
And decaying garbage
could be found everywhere.

01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:57.590
The rest are reports
from American towns

01:04:57.590 --> 01:04:59.810
of similar conditions.

01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:17.040
What is interesting is that
decline in epidemic diseases--

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:20.550
smallpox, whooping
cough, all of them--

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:21.555
follow this pattern.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:34.400
The introduction of chemical
antibiotics in medicine

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:38.630
occurs when the disease
is virtually at its end.

01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:42.590
All of this
prevention of disease

01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:44.765
occurs through
environmental control.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.700
The correlation between
income and health

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.160
is being proved by the
World Health Organization

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:56.925
over and over.

01:05:59.950 --> 01:06:10.990
In 1899 to 1902, the British
fought a war in South Africa

01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:12.670
called the Anglo-Boer War.

01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:23.200
In evaluating men
for the British Army,

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:28.030
they found that only a
percentage of Englishmen

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:32.530
were capable of serving
in the military.

01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:38.350
Such was the state, the
miserable state, of health.

01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:48.490
But over time, the changes in
the environmental condition

01:06:48.490 --> 01:06:55.520
of cities like Manchester,
although sporadic and due

01:06:55.520 --> 01:07:02.690
to phenomena such as charity
or British experiments

01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:07.010
with charitable
institutions, the invention

01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:10.640
of social housing, the fact
that the state would actually

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:16.100
play a role in providing
housing was all a phenomenon

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:18.770
of the British creation.

01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:30.710
But they didn't succeed
in many circumstances.

01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:37.550
I will show you a slide which
showed the case of housing

01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:44.180
in Scotland only a few years
hence, at least a few years

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:48.050
past, still in
abominable condition.

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:58.840
We move on to a set of
policies and changes

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:07.510
which were fundamental in making
this jump from the 19th century

01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:15.370
emergence of the industrial
city to the condition

01:08:15.370 --> 01:08:22.460
of emancipation that
I think everybody

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:32.078
has been wondering about since
the Great British achievement.

01:08:32.078 --> 01:08:33.620
Let's look at some
of these pictures.

01:08:36.130 --> 01:08:40.649
This is Pugin's
famous depiction--

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:51.399
the upper image is of 1440 and
the lower image is of 1840.

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:54.819
Look at what he's
conceives of in 1840.

01:08:54.819 --> 01:09:02.880
The water system, the river,
is now enclosed by factories.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:11.660
The determination
in the above slide

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:18.240
of tall religious
buildings is diminished.

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:22.710
Maybe one or two survive.

01:09:22.710 --> 01:09:23.640
What is this?

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:28.618
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:28.618 --> 01:09:30.410
JULIAN BEINART: But
it's got a particular--

01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:31.566
AUDIENCE: Panopticon?

01:09:31.566 --> 01:09:32.899
JULIAN BEINART: Panopticon, yes.

01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:40.430
How he conceives of a
panopticon in England in 1840,

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:43.490
I don't know.

01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:47.420
They were invented in
England by Bentham.

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:52.970
But it's strange that he would
place a panopticon so centrally

01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:59.320
in the image of an
industrial city.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.700
There's a church.

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:04.310
It's all a very
strange composition.

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:11.720
He identifies the
Catholic city of 1440

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:17.090
and the industrial city
of these steam pipe

01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:20.595
towers as living
together some how.

01:10:20.595 --> 01:10:21.095
Next.

01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:41.680
Manchester in 1850-- sewage
running into a public waterway.

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.180
Next.

01:10:52.970 --> 01:11:00.020
Manchester and Liverpool,
imports, exports,

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:04.890
railway mileage in Britain-- you
can take almost any graph 1840,

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:08.450
1845, 1850.

01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:14.540
The railway system in England
predicted the invention

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:18.560
of the use of railways
in urban situations.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.670
In 1876, the first
subway in London,

01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:29.660
on the northeast of London, was
connected to a suburban system.

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:33.740
An enormously foresighted--
one of the reasons

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:38.360
London is at such a low
density compared to Paris

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.780
is the railway system.

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:40.280
Next.

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:54.720
The plan of a street in an
enclosure in Manchester,

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.955
tunneled 2 foot 10 inches wide.

01:11:59.810 --> 01:12:09.940
It's 3 [INAUDIBLE] Glasgow,
an overcrowded dwelling still

01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:16.970
in existence in 1948--

01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:26.420
amongst the many critiques
of health in the British slum

01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:31.100
are the drugging of
children, incest,

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:33.710
people sleeping in the same bed.

01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:42.850
Here is a plan of an
overcrowded dwelling

01:12:42.850 --> 01:12:46.120
still in existence in 1948--

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.570
built-in bed, man, wife,
child, and two girls;

01:12:49.570 --> 01:12:55.270
single bed, three boys; mattress
on floor, girl on mattress.

01:12:58.865 --> 01:12:59.365
Next.

01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:05.140
Mumford's-- on the left--

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:11.060
Coketown-- the imposition
of an order of time

01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:17.030
on people's lives, which was
different to the time structure

01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:18.940
in rural life--

01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:26.925
it was the kind of condition
of being enslaved by time.

01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:35.130
The other critiques of
19th century industrial

01:13:35.130 --> 01:13:40.530
was that it had absolutely
no respect for nature,

01:13:40.530 --> 01:13:48.990
that it used land as
possibility of development

01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:51.930
independent of what
its outcomes would

01:13:51.930 --> 01:13:57.471
be on natural systems such as
water, sloping land, and so on.

01:13:57.471 --> 01:13:57.971
Next.

01:14:02.581 --> 01:14:11.370
A warning-- been invited
by the commissioner--

01:14:11.370 --> 01:14:13.620
in the pest-house
of the metropolis,

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:17.300
the disgrace to the nation, the
main thoroughfares are still

01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:19.920
without common sewers--

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.810
rates from time to--

01:14:21.810 --> 01:14:23.010
and so on.

01:14:23.010 --> 01:14:25.170
Unless something
be done speedily

01:14:25.170 --> 01:14:29.230
to allay the growing
discontent of the people,

01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:34.080
retributive justice in her
salutory vengeance will--

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.760
and so on and so on.

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.390
Here's cholera protesting
to Baron Haussmann

01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:42.630
that the disease--

01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:45.430
and so on and so on.

01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.930
Next.

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:57.430
A commons environment--
land subdivided into strips

01:14:57.430 --> 01:15:05.710
on the left, enclosed off the
common land, the same village.

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:11.650
Now these are objects or
sites for development.

01:15:11.650 --> 01:15:13.780
Next.

01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:16.720
And the pattern of
future industrialization

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.550
follows the pattern on the left.

01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:27.200
The first of the British
reactions to bylaws

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:28.920
standardizing housing--

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:36.550
this is in the East London.

01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:37.930
Next.

01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:44.440
OK, on Tuesday, we will
deal with the marvelous

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:48.840
story of London's 19th
century development.
