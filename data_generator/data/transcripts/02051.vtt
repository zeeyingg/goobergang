WEBVTT

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.020
PROFESSOR: So we've
just discussed

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.710
how inertia and buoyancy forces
can destabilize the fluid

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.980
and lead to complex
flows of air in a room.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.430
But now, let's think
about how those flows will

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.160
influence the transport
of aerosol droplets

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.750
which transmit disease.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.230
So maybe a simpler
way to think about it

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.720
is imagine we have
some object which

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.020
is releasing a
substance which could

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.190
be particles containing virus.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.760
It could also be heat or
other chemical release.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.820
And that's in a flow field
similar to the types of flow

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.440
fields that we've
been discussing.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.630
So that's the problem of
forced or natural convection,

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.340
convective transport
of particles.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.290
So here I show the problem
of flow past a cylinder.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.610
And let's say the cylinder
is a hot cylinder, which

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.160
is releasing heat into the fluid
which I've kind of sketched

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.400
by this red region here.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.250
Now if the flow is fast compared
to the diffusion of heat,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.840
you would expect a
situation like this

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.200
where there's a thin
boundary layer of heat

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.370
transfer along the
front end of the sphere.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.930
But on the trailing
end, there might

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.080
be a wake of kind
of hot fluid that's

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.390
been kind of carried away.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.190
And that is indeed
what happens when

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.060
we're in the regime of dominance
of convection over diffusion.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.560
And there is a dimensionless
which describes that,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.039
which is the Peclet number.

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.140
So the Peclet number is defined
as the velocity times a length

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.960
scale divided by D where D
that is the mass diffusivity.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.640
Now normally, D is the
molecular diffusivity.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.950
Or it's the diffusivity
or let's say the droplets

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.380
or whatever the
individual particles are.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.530
Now, if you want to think
about diffusion of gas--

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.820
so if we have for gas
molecules-- for example,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.270
like for CO2 or
oxygen in the air,

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.180
then the ratio of
kinematic viscosity

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.450
to diffusivity of
the gas molecules,

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.160
that's called the
Schmidt number,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.550
is also around 0.7 for air.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.170
So basically
molecules of momentum

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.790
are diffusing at
about the same rate.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.020
And so that tells us that
for the molecules of the gas,

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.590
the Peclet number is actually
the same as the Reynolds number

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.380
and, in fact, is very large.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:49.200
If we have a larger object
such as maybe a droplet,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.010
we have, of course, much
lower diffusivity than the air

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.760
molecules.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.310
And we're not talking and
it's a different process

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.420
on a collisional.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.200
But we're still dealing with
very large Peclet numbers

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.120
which will lead
to kind of wakes,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.050
as I've just described here.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.190
So it depends on the details
and the size of the particles.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.110
But for the gas, I
just want to write here

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.200
that Peclet number is on the
same order as the Reynolds

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.140
number and hence is very much
larger than 1 in many cases.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.060
Now the thing is that because
the Peclet number is 1,

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.300
the Peclet number is
measuring the importance

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.110
of convective
transport to diffusion.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.840
And so because the Peclet
number is typically large,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.910
we have a dominance
of convection

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.900
over diffusive process.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.280
So think of our
aerosol droplets.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.600
They do diffuse in the air.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.900
And we can calculate that
with the same Stokes-Einstein

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.600
formula that we've used earlier.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.850
But that diffusion
rate is very slow

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.570
compared to the sort
of convective processes

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.110
that are occurring in the room.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.050
And so we typically have
a high Peclet number

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.230
and we see this
kind of behavior.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.730
On the other hand, we're also
in the regime of high Reynolds

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.600
number.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.350
And that really changes things
because then the diffusion

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.230
due to sort of random
fluctuations and collisions

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.580
with other molecules is
overwhelmed by the sort

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.040
of transport and
diffusion light transport

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.360
that follows from
vortices and turbulence.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.160
So if I take that
same cylinder and I

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.600
at now at a higher
Reynolds number,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.890
then we can see that the wake
is not a thin little tail that

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.390
extends downstream
but it's really

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.560
a turbulent wake where the
warm fluid in this case

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.870
is dispersed everywhere
throughout that wake.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.980
In fact, it's fairly
uniformly mixed.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.370
A similar situation occurs
in the case of breathing,

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.250
coughing, sneezing, and other
forms of respiration, which

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.590
we will come to
shortly, where we

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.850
have a relatively high Reynolds
number flow, often turbulent,

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.120
and we are injecting in it some
respiratory aerosol particles.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.020
And they're quite well
mixed across that jet.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.540
So we can see there's
a very strong coupling

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.190
between the fluid flow
that we've just discussed,

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.080
which is often turbulent and
containing vortices and eddies,

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.090
and the transport of suspended
particles and droplets.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.380
So how can we think
about this problem?

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.920
So the important
thing is when we

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.080
get into this turbulent
regime, the way

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.490
an individual particle--

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.490
imagine-- I should think
even here in this case.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.410
How does an individual
particle move?

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.730
It kind of follows the flow.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.530
So it goes first through
a little vortices

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.090
occasionally around
a big vortex,

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.930
and then it does
some little ones.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.570
And so it's also
doing a random walk

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.650
but it's one that's driven
by the turbulent flow itself.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.110
And the length
scale for the sort

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.400
of steps of the random walk
is actually the vortex size.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.900
And in particular,
it's dominated

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.430
by the largest vortex.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.380
So whatever the flow
is, there's always

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.040
a certain scale which sets the
size of the largest vortex.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.750
And so that leads to the concept
of so-called eddy diffusivity

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:06.190
in turbulent flows, which is
also important in air flows.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.960
So the eddy diffusivity is
an effective diffusion-like

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.750
parameter that describes
the mixing and spreading

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.730
of suspended particles or
droplets in a flow field that

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.290
is turbulent.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.970
And in that case, we
can write it two ways.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.490
So either we have an
imposed velocity u

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:36.630
and we have length scale l,
and then our eddy viscosity

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.290
might be written as u times l.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.940
So u is distance per time.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.570
l is distance.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:47.990
So it's distance
squared per time.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.460
So that has units of viscosity.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.210
And the way to interpret
this is basically

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.720
sort of swirling around
eddies of a size l

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.880
and a characteristic velocity u.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.680
Another way to write
this would be that it's l

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.740
squared over 2
times a timescale.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.910
Because we often
write diffusion,

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.260
if there's a time step
tau, and a length scale

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.520
l for a given step, then
l squared over 2 tau

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.570
is the diffusivity.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.220
That's how we think about
molecular diffusivity as well.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.760
But the question is,
what is this timescale.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:28.720
So we can see here that
the timescale is l over u.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.060
So it's a convective
times scale.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.820
It's the time to, essentially,
go around one of those eddies.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.730
And I'm writing these really
just as scaling arguments here.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.840
So if we look at
these flows, what

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.140
are the relevant length scales?

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.310
So at the beginning
of this flow here,

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.150
it's the length scale
is that of the object.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.060
In the case of the
breathing, the length scale

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.020
is initially that of
the mouth opening.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.230
But then we form these turbulent
structures that expand.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.730
And a constant we
will return to you

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.890
shortly is that
the relevant length

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:07.780
scale as you continue
here is actually something

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.440
which depends on position.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.810
So as this thing
grows the eddies

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.490
are are getting
bigger and bigger,

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.850
and so also is faster and faster
the transport by diffusion,

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.020
which sort of maintains a
fairly uniform concentration

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.350
across that space.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.790
And that brings us then to
what happens in the whole room.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.230
So we've been very interested
in mixing in the whole room.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.570
And so a natural picture
here is to say, well,

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:39.030
if the room has a height H,
then the eddy diffusivity,

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.250
which aerosol
particles in the room

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.540
are feeling as long as it's a
fairly well mixed turbulent,

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:51.270
more isotropic flow, could be
described as the height squared

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.660
over 2 times a timescale.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:09:00.540
And the timescale should be
that of the effective air

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.530
change or the total air
change time, basically.

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.260
So this here,
again, I've written

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.830
lambda bar a is
the outer airflow

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.260
plus the re-circulation
airflow, which

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.160
may be going through a filter,
and divided by the total volume

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.030
of the room.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:24.320
So this is the total ACH.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.560
And so what we see here then
is that the formula is roughly

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:35.070
that we should have 1/2
H squared lambda a bar.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.650
And so this is a very simple
argument based on the largest

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.120
eddy is going to be,
in a well mixed room,

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.090
at the size of the
scale of the room.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.730
And sure enough,
this relationship

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:54.740
has actually been verified for
houses and actual indoor rooms

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.320
with all the furniture
in them, where

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.180
it's been shown
that if you release

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.450
a passive tracer such as
carbon dioxide in the middle

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.620
of the room and you
have the ventilation

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:11.690
on at a certain ACH, Air Change
per Hour, lambda a bar, then

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.430
this formula, even
with the 1/2 actually,

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.610
turns out to be a pretty good
approximation for the spreading

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.650
in that room as you change
the size of the room

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:22.100
and look at different rooms
and also look at different air

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.440
change rates.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.820
So that's, I think, a good
starting point for us as well.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.440
At least when the
room is well mixed,

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.470
this is a good way to think
about transport in the room.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.970
Also, we see from this picture
that the timescale for mixing

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:40.320
is the inverse of
the air change time.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:46.100
So the mixing time is also
comparable to the residence

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:51.180
time of the air,
including re-circulation.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.640
So basically it's
the time it takes

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.980
for air to typically
go through this system

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.360
is also the time it takes to
fully mix the system, roughly

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.010
the same order of magnitude.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:05.170
And that is the characteristic
of a well mixed turbulent room

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.920
which could occur by
any of the mechanisms

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.960
we've just been describing.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.770
Although the same principles
also apply to jets or strong,

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.650
maybe ventilation flows past
an object where you might still

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.930
have some heterogeneities
as I've sketched here,

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.380
that we will need to consider.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.720
The last point I'd
like to come back to

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.890
also is the question
of sedimentation.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:29.360
So you may have
found it surprising

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.300
that we describe the flux
of sedimenting particles

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.040
to the ground in
a very simple way

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.810
by just using the
Stokes velocity, vs,

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.280
and multiplying by the area.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:49.490
So we said the droplet
flux out of the room

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.300
was just the sedimentation
velocity of the droplet, which

00:11:53.300 --> 00:12:01.080
was radius dependent, times the
area, the floor surface area.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.000
And what's a bit confusing
about that at first

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.190
is that we know the flows
are very complex in the room.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.190
In fact, if you look at
dust particles in a room

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.510
as we discussed earlier
in some cases, for sure,

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.920
you will see them actually
rising and not settling.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.110
So they may be settling
relative to the flow.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.920
But the flow is actually
convecting them upwards.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.420
And that's here,
for example, if you

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.640
look at there's a
dominant role in the flow

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.990
that I've sketched here.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.000
The particles over
here actually might

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.760
have a net velocity going up.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.050
And over here,
they're going down.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:31.290
But if you decompose
that velocity field, then

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:38.320
in some cases, they're going
up due to flow or convection,

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.890
while they're sedimenting
at the rate vs.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.930
But then necessarily,
because the fluid

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.960
is approximately incompressible
and is returning somewhere--

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.650
wherever it goes up, somewhere
else it's coming down,

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.800
we find that in other
areas you have vs still

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.510
pointing down with the same rate
and now the flow is going down.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:58.930
And if you imagine
a particle that

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.930
is sampling all the
different velocity vectors,

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.560
the blue vectors,
sometimes they're up,

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.570
sometimes they're
down, on average

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.240
the blue velocity vectors of
the flow have to average to 0.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.880
Because there's no--
or at least near 0.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.860
There's not, let's
say, a very strong

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.620
vertical relative motion.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.870
Then it's reasonable to
assume that the particles will

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:21.160
sediment out of a well mixed
turbulent flow at a rate given

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.090
by vsa.

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:23.890
And that is something
that has also

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:27.880
been validated experimentally
for well mixed chambers

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.550
and rooms.
