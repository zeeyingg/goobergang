00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.680
JULIAN BEINART: Early on in
Russia, an estimate was made,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.330
and national policy would
provide nine square meters

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.100
of private space per person in
housing as an official policy.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.310
This remained throughout,
although it's much lower

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.680
than any other European city.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.130
When St. Petersburg
was two million people,

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.040
they were still operating on
a nine square meter policy,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.060
even under Khrushchev's
Microraion policy.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.260
Anyway, let's start
with Great Britain.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.570
I'm not that interested
in you following

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.400
the details of the case.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.660
I have a bad cold,
and I won't remember

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.840
the difference between
Milutin and, well, Melnikov.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.350
Of course I know the difference
between Milutin and Melnikov,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.230
but some of the [? Bart ?]
brothers, and the Vesnin

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.740
brothers, and all the
architects and urbanists

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.000
who were involved in
this intense period.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.600
There was more examination of
the formal options of cities

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:46.930
between 1919 and 1925 in
Russia in a compressed period

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.225
than almost anywhere since.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.740
So it's worth us looking at it,
both as theory and as practice.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.715
Let's look at Great Britain.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.830
Joseph Paxton, the gardener who
designed the Crystal Palace,

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.790
said when he proposed the
Victorian way in London, which

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.230
was roughly the four by
one and a half square box

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.970
in the center of London,
he said, "We in Britain

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.510
solve all problems by common
sense and technology."

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.770
And that's the
mantra, which precedes

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.761
throughout the
British 19th century,

00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:43.570
with the intense change being
softened by social policy

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.960
changes at the same, in
some curious way providing

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.290
enough intellectual
freedom for Marx and Engels

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.500
to create a new
political philosophy,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.620
which changed Eastern Europe
and led to the Soviet Union.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.680
Now these relationships
are not that direct,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.080
but nevertheless, had Marx
and Engels been closeted

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.170
in Germany, or even
in France, and not

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.830
given the intellectual freedom
that they had in England,

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.320
the outcomes of the 1918
Revolution in Russia

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.820
would have probably
been different.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.700
So here, you have
an intersecting

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.180
of two philosophies--
common sense and technology.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.110
You remember my statistics,
that between Peterloo

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.330
in Manchester in 1811 and
Bloody Sunday in Northern

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.315
Ireland in 19--

00:03:49.315 --> 00:03:53.590
god knows when, over
100 years of time--

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.920
the British police or the
army only killed something

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.270
like 11 people.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.760
That a society could
transform itself

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.300
without the state involving
itself in violence

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.960
is an incredible
credit to any society.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.870
There are very few places
that could [? end it. ?]

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:24.960
So I said this is a preface to
the British decision in 1946

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.675
to embark on a new towns policy.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.950
The earlier years
of the 20th century

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.315
had been difficult for England.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.620
13 out of the--

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.500
let me put on my glasses--

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:52.340
13 out of the 46 years
between 1899 and 1945,

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.430
Britain had been
involved in war.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.850
The number of males who were
killed in the British army--

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.880
of course, hardly any women
were in the British army

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.370
during this period--

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.770
was a high proportion.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.510
You will notice
Victorian novels which

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.990
are adumbrated into TV movies
like "Upstairs, Downstairs,"

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.930
one of the young men is
always dressed in uniform.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.720
There's a presence of the
military in the British society

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.800
which is oscillates from
pop music to hero worship,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.360
preparing Britain for the
worst confrontation of all

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.250
between 1939 and 1945.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.940
Add these years of war
to the Depression years,

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.070
the international
Depression years,

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:01.020
from early 1930s
onwards, and you

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:10.120
have a country which is engaged
in material affairs which

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.520
are not really predominantly
located inside England itself.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.200
In 1946, the Labor
Party wins the election

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.910
and decides to retool England.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:33.130
When I was a student
in England in the '50s

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.702
England was barely
off rationing food.

00:06:37.702 --> 00:06:40.180
The car population
of England was

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:48.490
what it was in the
United States in 1927.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:55.140
So the British set out
to work simultaneously

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.090
on a number of innovative
ideas about hospitals,

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.520
about universities--
and I will show you

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.580
some of the university
plans in sequence

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.240
in a later class as a
demonstration of how you

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.830
experiment with certain notions
about university education,

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.700
leading from
categorical campus plans

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:28.860
after Basil Spence in 1950
to the dematerialization

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.560
of the physical
structure of universities

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:38.100
in the Loughborough
College example, and so on.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.090
As far as new talent was
concerned, a number of things

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.880
were to be taken into account.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.850
First of all, the British had a
history of building new talent.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.410
Letchworth and Welwyn Garden
City by Ebenezer Howard

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.810
were both successful,
privately sponsored,

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.090
not state interventions at all.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.710
That they should serve as
a model for a new policy

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.660
experience is interesting.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.830
It seems to me that
even advanced societies,

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:20.590
such as Great Britain, build
on, in the common sense

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.860
and technology model, build step
by step on previous experience,

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.780
extrapolating it.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:32.250
For instance, the new
town's committee report,

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.299
government publication, 1946--

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:43.365
let's read what it says about
the size of these new towns.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.160
"Our conclusions as
to the range of size

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.700
have been reinforced by the
replies received to a broadcast

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.210
on 15th January, 1946."

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:05.320
This is pretty
primitive participation.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.260
This is before television.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:12.190
"Of those who stated they would
prefer to live in a new town,

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.600
the numbers in favor of
20,000, 40,000, and 60,000

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.770
were approximately equal,
while only about one in seven

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:26.185
were in favor of towns
under 20,000 or over 60,000.

00:09:26.185 --> 00:09:29.890
If you ask a bunch of
people a question like this,

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.770
what do you expect?

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:36.530
You expect you will get
a culturally centralized

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.030
argument.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.460
Now, number 21--
"why do we believe

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.680
the normal range of
population should

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.670
be between 30,000 to 50,000?

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.770
Special consideration
by the world

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.070
may well justify the
creation of a new town

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.160
with less than 20,000 people."

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:03.640
What is the population of Welwyn
Garden City and Letchworth,

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.597
the target population?

00:10:06.597 --> 00:10:07.930
AUDIENCE: The target population?

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:08.815
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:10:08.815 --> 00:10:09.357
AUDIENCE: 30.

00:10:09.357 --> 00:10:12.116
JULIAN BEINART: 30, Yeah.

00:10:12.116 --> 00:10:14.183
AUDIENCE: But they
only got [? 15? ?]

00:10:14.183 --> 00:10:16.600
JULIAN BEINART: I don't know
what the population is today.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.110
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:18.550
AUDIENCE: --not even
half, close to half.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.425
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:48.550
Mark One, Harlow Stevenage,
et cetera, population 30,000,

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:57.100
towns which follow a model of
a center or a single center,

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:05.090
compartment the neighborhood
around it by rail system,

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:09.310
which runs through a
tube parallel to London,

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:14.300
or to Glasgow, to
wherever these towns were,

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:20.890
a modest city center, and a
clear distribution of parts.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.190
The architectural
paradigm at the time

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:33.340
was the 1952, '51, yeah.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.180
New Britain
Exposition in London--

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.890
don't worry about
my handwriting.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:39.930
It's not important.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:56.120
Mark Two towns were
more experimental.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.750
So these are
attached to the past.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:10.300
People were starting to wonder,
particularly the architects,

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.990
as to what innovations
are possible

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.450
beyond this nuclear town.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:41.580
So you get towns
like Hook Cumbernauld

00:12:41.580 --> 00:13:11.830
C-U-M-B-E-R-N-A-U-L-D, Irvine,
and Runcorn, R-U-N-C-O-R-N.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:19.930
Hook is a town which
established itself in a valley,

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.150
so the center of the city
occupies many levels.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.680
And the neighborhoods
are in a linear city,

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.800
within walking
distance of the center.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:40.210
The social engineering is that
you live on the periphery,

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.450
you will have to walk through
existing neighborhoods

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.840
in order to get to the
center of the city.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.000
The plan is a linear formation.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:09.170
Cumbernauld establishes the
first multi-level central city

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:14.600
apparatus, with great fare, and
enormously lauded by architects

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.190
internationally.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.770
In the last page
of what I've given

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.550
you is the contemporary
view of Cumbernauld.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:25.610
It's considered the ugliest
building in England,

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.210
and half of it's being
torn down at the moment.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:37.900
It's on the last page.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.365
Irvine is a linear town.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:05.360
And Runcorn is
built on two hills,

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.830
with a figure eight
configuration for train system,

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.800
with the center--

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.440
this is residential,
residential.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.800
And the configuration
is set by the topography

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.425
and by the rail system,
which meets in the center.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:37.040
So these were all
propositions, which said, look,

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.930
there must be some
innovations which

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:46.725
are possible in the departure
from the conventional version

00:15:46.725 --> 00:15:47.225
of a town.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:55.885
We can judge the success
of these in prospect.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:02.220
This was followed by
the mark three towns.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:18.240
Here, the population
was 50,000 to 100,000.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:30.960
The Mark Three towns were now
plus 100,000, up to 250,000.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.220
And the most celebrated
of them, of course,

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:57.590
is Milton Keynes, which now
introduces a grid system

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:01.650
as the basic spatial
structure of the town.

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:04.819
An enormous increase
in affluence in England

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:13.849
during this time representing,
amongst other things,

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:21.710
an increase in the use of
automobiles, and the effects

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:29.700
in its thinking of
philosophers, like the American

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.470
from the University
of California

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.200
at Berkeley, Melvin Webber.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:40.360
You'll read his writing a
bit later in this class,

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.270
arguing that community
without propinquity

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:47.950
is a new possibility, given
improved communication

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:53.860
technologies, and therefore,
another set of imprimaturs

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.940
need to be examined
before you decide

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:06.310
on priorities of pedestrian
walking distances, and so on.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:17.190
Milton Keynes-- anyway, what
creates this enormous spike?

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.370
I could make another graph
on the blackboard, which

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.790
shows that Plato
represents 30,000

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.070
is the ideal size for a town.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:30.150
Leonardo represents
[INAUDIBLE] 30,000.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.650
30,000 seems to be the
lingua franca of town size

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:39.450
until about 1960, 1970.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:44.642
What determines 30,000?

00:18:44.642 --> 00:18:46.260
Why 30,000?

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:51.440
Why does it remain a generalist,
classical architecture

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.470
has remained as an attribute
of our performance?

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:01.370
Is it demographic?

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:06.050
The demography of Plato's
time and the demography

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.950
of the Renaissance
are already different.

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:12.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.700
JULIAN BEINART: From the
Renaissance [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:20.000
through the plague epidemic
through enormous differences

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.330
in life cycles, and
so on, we end up

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:27.830
with whatever [INAUDIBLE]
at 30,000 again.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.050
I don't know of
anybody who's actually

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:31.760
studied this phenomenon.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.360
If some you are
interested in the research

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:43.310
to understand why 30,000 has
remained an ideal estimator

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:48.020
for new towns, until the
Mark Two British towns

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.540
decided they were too small.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:20:01.080
Part of the switch to
larger size in England

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.670
is accompanied by
greater affluence.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:10.418
Why do you need a larger
town when you're wealthier?

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:12.995
AUDIENCE: People want more land.

00:20:12.995 --> 00:20:14.870
JULIAN BEINART: There
are more opportunities.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:28.240
Milton Keynes now has
its own football club,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.860
and so on, and so on.

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:41.320
The way land is rationed by the
market or by the state changes,

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:46.180
as it has in Russia, from
nine square meters per person

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.310
to what it is today.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.440
More than half the
Russian housing

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.200
today is in the private market.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.290
So I don't know
what the estimate

00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:01.180
is of its current
square foot status.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.000
These are fundamental
theoretical questions,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.730
which few people seem to be
interested in engaging in.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.540
What is conservatism
and innovation

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:18.900
as a phenomenon in the
decision about space?

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.380
Russia took a completely
different trajectory.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:28.110
They had no history other than
a history which was miserable,

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:32.100
and about which nobody
wished to do anything.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:36.660
They were in a fundamentally
primitive state.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.350
Hannes Meyer was the Swiss
guy who took over the Bauhaus

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:43.200
after Gropius, was
a good Communist

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.100
himself, talks about
visiting Russia,

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:58.340
Moscow after the revolution.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.970
He talks about Moscow.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:06.530
In the Arbat, the quarter of
the city in which the wealthiest

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:10.460
merchants lived, only 16%
of all dwelling houses

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.230
were connected to
the water main.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.620
It's a phenomenal
statistic, given

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:22.160
the wealth of the czarist
regime, and all of its courts.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:27.750
And in the [? Prison ?]
[? Peratovski ?] region,

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:34.710
a czarist, working-class
area 0.6% had a water tap.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:42.780
This is in 1918.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.810
Let's talk a little
more about England

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:50.035
before we finish
and move to Russia.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.790
The British New Towns
policy built something

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:00.760
like 28 new towns--

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.125
21 in England, two in
Wales, five in Scotland.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:10.805
And according to a statistic
I've used for a while,

00:23:10.805 --> 00:23:12.180
and I don't know
if it's correct,

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.600
1.4 million people live
in new towns in England

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.960
now, about 1/60 out of
the total population.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.360
Much of the thinking
came from a couple

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:33.750
of what we now consider to be
relatively primitive ideas,

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:37.680
that Abercrombie's
plan for London

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.000
created a major investment
in a green belt,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.480
on the grounds that agriculture
should be preserved close

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.900
to the central city.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.340
Imagine that to be the
case of American cities.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.810
I wouldn't have any
bananas for breakfast

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:01.590
if I depended on
agriculture within driving

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:02.970
distance of Boston.

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.940
Secondly, that nature
would be preserved,

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.890
and that would be a good thing.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:16.150
And access to
nature for citizens

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:24.550
would be an advantage
in urban life.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:27.220
Think about this--

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.680
Cambridge University
in England is

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.110
one of the great universities
of the world, if not

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.940
the most valuable.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.390
Anybody who has teachers
such as Darwin and Newton

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:41.650
and a couple of others
could claim that category.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.200
Cambridge controls the
center of Cambridge.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:56.930
It's surrounded by a green belt
in which much development has

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.820
been frustrated.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.700
Occasional development
has been allowed,

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.610
which is one of the problems
of the green belt philosophy--

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.840
that it's almost
impossible to maintain,

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.440
even in a very
diligent government.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:18.480
In Chandigarh, for instance,
the sacred land north

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:23.040
of the Capitol Complex depicted
by Corbusier's drawings

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.940
of the Himalayas in the
distance and the Capitol Center

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.460
in the foreground.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:33.540
When we did a studio in
Chandigarh, of our students

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.970
patrolled this area,
and saw all kinds

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:41.090
of signs of land being sold
and available for purchase.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:44.670
The administrator of
Chandigarh was appalled.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.790
He said he didn't know this.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:26:00.610
So you can assume that even
in England, the administration

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:06.820
of public land in
large quantities,

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:14.380
as large as a green belt
around London, is difficult,

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:20.340
let alone open to
avenues of corruption.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:25.750
Secondly, taking
out of the market

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:29.860
a significant portion
of available land

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.370
must have an effect on the
value of the land which

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:34.540
is not taken out.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.190
So the abstract calculation
of cities saying every city

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:51.690
should have a green belt
is as much nonsense,

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:56.730
without taking into account
the particular economic,

00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:01.620
socioeconomic context of the
city that you're dealing with.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.110
They are, no doubt, cities
in parts of the world

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:09.330
in which the green belt would
be a reasonably good idea.

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:12.990
Off the top of my
head, some cities

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:18.080
have topological features,
like Bogota has a mountain.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.290
And they're right up
against it, which prohibits

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.270
significant development.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:27.810
Cities with enormous
topography have access

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:33.000
to natural vegetation,
and natural open space,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.550
and probably don't need
a green belt as much

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:36.685
as a city on a plain.

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:51.530
My response is
simply, a response

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:57.510
to the large problem of urbanism
is never absolutely correct.

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:00.110
It's formulaic.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:03.410
My advice to you is
always to question

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.740
whether it's appropriate.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:10.835
Linguistically, city
administrators pick up words.

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:18.330
The biggest problem
of working, as I have,

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:23.520
in the non-European/American
world is not the cleverness

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.010
of what your ideas are.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:29.525
It's how capable they are
of being put into place.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.530
Try writing
high-rise regulations

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.990
for cities like Amman
in Jordan, which

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:44.850
we did after the Iraq explosion,
and the enormous transfer

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:50.970
of capital from
Baghdad to Jordan.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:53.970
There's no working stock
exchange in Jordan.

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:55.980
It's a poor country.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:04.110
And Iraqi money wanted to
build skyscrapers immediately.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:06.690
The mayor, the new
mayor, asked us

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.480
to provide him with some
high-rise regulations.

00:29:12.426 --> 00:29:15.350
And how do you implement
high-rise regulations

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:19.130
without a sophisticated
group of people?

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.290
Putting a high-rise
building in a valley

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:25.310
is different from putting
it in on top of a mountain.

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:29.000
And the topography
of Amman, just

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.980
like the topography
of Jerusalem,

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.320
is undulating all
over the place.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:40.730
Secondly, does the meaning
of a building by Renzo Piano

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:43.850
have the same meaning
as a building decorated

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:50.480
with artificial cosmetics, and
Islamic symbols, and so on?

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:59.950
Thirdly, tall buildings in a
flat city are very important.

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:02.700
They stand out more.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:06.450
Fourthly, the difference between
a hotel and an office building

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:08.760
is significant with
regard to what?

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.990
Come on, you're
working in Amman.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:18.210
What is the difference
between a developer who

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:20.520
wants to build an office
building versus one who

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.505
wants to build a hotel?

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.510
Think about transportation.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:32.630
How many people commute to an
office building every morning?

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.990
How many people commute
to a hotel every morning?

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:40.270
A hotel is revenue
neutral as far

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:42.670
as transportation is concerned.

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:45.805
An office building
is revenue active.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:56.130
I'm just giving you a list
of the things that we listed.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:31:00.060
The mayor of [? Arvan ?]
has no planning staff,

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.930
or maybe has an
assistant or so on.

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.060
What do you do?

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.480
He simply says yes or no.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.930
Given the political
pressure on him to say yes,

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:16.830
when money is to be
made in a poor country,

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.710
how are you going to
expect a rational decision

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:28.320
to preserve the quality
of the built environment?

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.660
It's a depressing prospect.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.770
It argues, on the
one hand, for wanting

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:41.410
to go for the few fundamentals
that you can't live without.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:49.580
Transportation is one of them,
but the meaning of buildings

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.410
is--

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:55.310
Boston itself has difficulty
with the Design Review

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:58.010
Committee, which
John [? Lemonceau, ?]

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:01.100
who's now an Emeritus
Professor here, used to chair.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:08.090
What can you tell an architect
colleague of yours about

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:09.470
why his building is ugly?

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:17.255
Anyway, enough-- the
British manage somehow.

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:30.410
Amongst the reading I
gave you-- and I want

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.390
to switch because we
otherwise we're going

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:36.020
to have to take too much time.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.230
I gave you an article
by Lionel March

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:40.560
called "Why have new towns?"

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:44.630
It's a pretty fundamental
piece of writing.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:52.430
Why do you think America has
not got a legacy of new towns?

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:58.820
Why are Columbia, and Reston,
and the green-belt towns

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.500
of Roosevelt exceptions?

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:09.370
Come on, you should
know this stuff.

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:12.100
You're the most
highly educated group

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.530
of young people in the world.

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:17.570
Guess.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:27.750
Why Chicago did not develop
[? the state ?] of new towns?

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:33.550
Why has Los Angeles or
Phoenix just generalized

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:36.315
the metropolitan area
through suburban growth?

00:33:43.163 --> 00:33:44.330
AUDIENCE: Because it takes--

00:33:49.678 --> 00:33:50.220
I don't know.

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.762
I was going to say
something about it

00:33:51.762 --> 00:33:55.260
taking a centralized force
similar to the state, not

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.557
the state.

00:33:56.557 --> 00:33:58.140
[INAUDIBLE] think
that far in advance.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.780
And with Columbia, it
was sort of like that.

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.570
And Columbia had the advantage
of being in between two

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:04.860
metropolitan centers.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.990
JULIAN BEINART:
Yeah, I think that's

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:09.540
a good generalized answer.

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:14.250
One of the problems
about a new town

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:19.560
is that the capital that
you need to invest early on

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.590
returns its return only
after a long period of time.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:26.520
Somebody's got to hold
the baby in the meantime,

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:33.270
while you are out for dinner,
if that analogy is any good.

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:36.780
I don't know.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.340
The state did it in England.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.230
The state controlled
all of the land.

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:47.170
First of all, the state
controls more land in England

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:50.739
than the state does
in the United States,

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:57.820
but given the authority that
the TVA had in 1933 onwards,

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.620
it could have built new towns.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:06.100
It built Norris, which is
a small town in Tennessee,

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:13.000
but we have relied on private
development significantly more

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.710
than our national development.

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:17.695
We have no national industrial
policy, for instance.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:25.200
You may argue as to whether
it's a good idea to have one.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:29.380
And there are many
arguments both ways,

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:33.150
but in Britain, it was
acceptable for the state

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:37.680
to decide that an industry
should locate in the Potteries

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:48.360
area of the Stoke Valley
to deal with unemployment.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.820
And the version of
that in this country

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:56.010
is under Clinton, the
idea of giving subsidies

00:35:56.010 --> 00:36:03.990
to industries to locate next to
poorer, inner-city communities.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:07.770
It was a policy which,
in extremis, was applied

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:13.380
by the South African
government to slow down

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:17.790
the growth of Johannesburg,
Cape Town, and Durban,

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:23.135
by giving enormous incentives to
industry that would locate next

00:36:23.135 --> 00:36:25.890
to [? disadvantaged ?] areas.

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:30.060
I.e., you have to take
account of the diseconomies

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.780
of the location, and make
up for the diseconomies

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:37.050
of the location by subsidy.

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:45.340
This is not-- if BMW wants
to move to South Carolina,

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:50.200
or Boeing wants to build its
Dreamliner in South Carolina,

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.890
the United States'
democratic process

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:56.980
is not one in which the
state indulges itself

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.980
in that decision.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:03.070
It will allow the
states to compete

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:06.940
in giving benefits
to any decision

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:11.530
that BMW or Boeing will make.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:15.040
That Boeing decides to locate
in the state which is not

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:20.155
trade unionized, we smile.

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:30.550
I'm talking out of class.

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:33.205
I should shut up and just deal
with the British new towns.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.140
The British new towns have not--

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:46.265
one of the other
paragraphs I could

00:37:46.265 --> 00:37:50.640
have read from the 1946
report was that the town

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.720
should be balanced.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.750
You get a similar
idea to balancing,

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:59.250
which if you remember
a couple of weeks ago,

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:03.210
I used in talking about
the Sunnyside Gardens

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:06.660
[? redband ?] phenomenon
in this country, Clarence

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.940
Stein and Henry Wright.

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:16.100
Lewis Mumford said you have a
need for balanced community.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.650
That is, you need workers,
and elites, and artists,

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:24.070
and professionals
in one community.

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:28.680
Most of the immigrant
and unskilled workers

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:34.060
emigrating to England go
to the largest cities.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.770
So the whole
Abercrombie argument

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:42.540
that new towns slow the
growth of established

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:46.420
metropolitan areas doesn't work.

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.800
The market is still functioning
in a way in larger--

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:54.300
you may say that
in a large city,

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:57.270
there's enough
variety in the market

00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:00.480
to take care of more people
than you can in the new town.

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:06.610
My gut feeling is
that this is correct.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:11.110
The range of rent per
square foot in Los Angeles

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:14.860
is probably much larger
than the restricted range

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:19.240
of rent in a British new town.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:23.530
I throw these out because they
are interesting arguments.

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:26.560
You are going to be responsible
for making decisions

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.250
about the form of places.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:35.380
Just this morning, I've
already drifted off

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:40.180
into lots of intricate arguments
about the relationship,

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:45.340
for instance, between land
economy and the form of places.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.650
What are you going to tell
the government of Pakistan,

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:54.850
as I was asked, to design a
new town parallel to Lahore,

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:55.980
five years ago?

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:00.915
That it's a bad idea?

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:05.810
On what grounds
going to-- what are

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:07.130
you going to use for argument?

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:09.642
There's no theory.

00:40:09.642 --> 00:40:11.600
This is the only class
in theory you ever going

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:17.490
to take, except perhaps
in social science.

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:19.130
Architecture doesn't
deal with theory.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:25.180
So what are you going to say
to the governor of Pakistan

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.760
or the governor of Lahore?

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:35.490
Yes, it's OK.

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:41.220
This is land that the
army doesn't need anymore.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.710
Pakistan is a
growing enterprise,

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:48.255
in terms of siphoning
off from India work

00:40:48.255 --> 00:40:55.750
in advanced technologies,
and electronic communication

00:40:55.750 --> 00:41:02.970
systems, huge markets,
available trained people.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:07.500
Why not build a new city to
attract American enterprises

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.651
and into you know the story?

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:19.110
What are you going
to do about migration

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:21.315
to a new economic
entity in Pakistan?

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:29.890
A practical problem-- if
you create a new economic

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:34.450
opportunity like Chandigarh,
if you're Corbusier,

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:38.980
you keep on designing it as
if nothing is ever going to--

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:43.540
and mutilate his concept.

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.880
Fact is that people
from poor areas

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:53.380
migrate to limited economic
opportunities in the region.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:57.580
And sprawl-- they are
called "squatters."

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.100
What do you say to the
people wanting to build

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.720
a new town in Pakistan?

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:06.820
How are you going to deal with
it in the planning of the town?

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.820
That's a big problem.

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:10.780
We'll ignore it.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:16.133
We'll get the military to
pull down illegal housing.

00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:17.800
Where are you going
to get a labor force

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.810
to do the lowest income work?

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:25.940
Seeing you have no decent
economic policy for the poorest

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:29.045
people in your country anyway,
what the hell does it matter?

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:32.870
This is real practice.

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:35.990
I'm talking about my
experience five years ago.

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:38.330
I'm not inventing this.

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:43.160
I raised the question of trying
to invent an economic system

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:47.450
whereby free land, or land
under some kind of indenture

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:52.460
agreement, could help
people build up capital

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.190
that they earned
in the new city,

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:58.550
that the economic engine
of capital creation

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:03.700
and establishment could be--

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.870
and it's been tried in
certain parts of the world.

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:11.870
And I think it's one of the
answers to the use of land

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:18.230
and the sharing of the increased
value of land in a city.

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:23.770
But I'm not an expert.

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:25.860
I'm only a teacher at MIT.

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:34.180
I've just been asked
whether I could possibly

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:39.430
do a new strategic plan for
Abu Dhabi, which I'm not

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:43.570
going to do, because I
haven't got the energy

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:46.270
and time to do it.

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:54.430
But just imagining how to do
a strategic plan for Abu Dhabi

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:56.890
involves taking into
account a number

00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:58.810
of things, which I
don't think you'd be

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:00.115
allowed to take into account.

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.300
Number one is the real
ecology of the place.

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:13.130
I've done three projects in
the Emirates, one of which

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:18.040
was on Saadiyat Island,
where a ecological firm

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:24.340
from Philadelphia decided that
the island should be left alone

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:28.060
because it was an important
migration center for birds

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:35.020
from northern Europe moving
systematically to the south

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:40.090
in the winter, and other
important considerations.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:47.370
None of that's been taken
into account anyway.

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:53.005
I'm sorry, I'm just
deviating from our sad story.

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:03.910
Russia is simpler and
much more complicated.

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:06.100
You have a couple of things--

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:08.980
there's no precedent
to build on.

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:13.150
All of the intense
rhetoric of Marx and Engels

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:15.970
said three things about cities--

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:18.760
capital cities are dying.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.560
They must be an option.

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:23.770
Number two, integrate
the country in the city.

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:25.405
And number three
I can't remember.

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:35.280
Let me look at my notes.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.330
Separation of city and
country, distribution

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:51.720
of population over
the whole territory,

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.150
destruction of capital city--

00:45:54.150 --> 00:46:00.720
you don't do very well with that
as a kit bag of information.

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.810
When you're dealing with the
largest country in the world,

00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:09.240
with 11 time zones from one
side of the country to another,

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:15.570
with a Marxist theoretical
position which focused itself

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:19.380
on the workers of the state and
not the business of a state--

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.695
it's the largely
agricultural region.

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.910
If you want to read a good
little book, "Ten Days

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:32.910
That Shook the World" is
the story of the first days

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:37.050
of the first Russian cabinet.

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:44.430
And this woman is given the keys
to the Agriculture Department.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.020
She comes there.

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.570
She can't get into the building.

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:50.700
The lights are not
working, and she's

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:55.020
got to feed the whole
of the universe.

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.760
It's remarkable
that they survived.

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:08.860
However, there was an enormous
attraction given to the fact

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:13.660
that you had a new philosophy
which governed then.

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:17.330
The state controlled
all of the land.

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:22.690
You had a new, potentially
educated proletariat

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:29.770
who were educated to norms of
goodness, and social equity,

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:33.130
and certain givens,
which you didn't

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:34.555
find in the capitalist state.

00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:45.105
And we're having to go
through this rather quickly.

00:47:53.860 --> 00:48:00.010
The period of about
15 to 20 years

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:03.550
set up an intense speculation.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:06.910
Given different attitudes
towards technology,

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:10.870
given different attitudes
towards the distribution

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:19.360
of society, different
attitudes towards urbanization,

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:25.150
none of which had a
set of researched--

00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:27.940
the Russians had built
a garden city called

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:33.670
Kazan in the early 20th century,
which is relatively successful.

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:39.430
And Kazan appears as a basis for
some of the plans for Moscow,

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:41.600
I think the most, if
not the most of it.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.000
And I think [INAUDIBLE] plan.

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:52.310
There are three
major institutions.

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:53.400
They're now private firms.

00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:04.050
After the establishment or the
disestablishment of the USSR,

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:09.720
we took part with a group
called [? Lengi ?] [? Progore ?]

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:13.770
in a new plan for
St. Petersburg.

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:17.070
And [? Lengi ?] [? Progore ?]
was with the Russian Institute.

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:23.370
And the Russian Institute, they
had clients in Vladivostok.

00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:28.460
They would fly through 11 time
zones to get to their clients--

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:32.370
an incredible apparatus.

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:35.570
They'd never worked on a
city problem themselves.

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.800
It's interesting stories.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:51.370
Anyway, there are three major
academic practicing groups.

00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:59.170
They all have names based
on shortened versions.

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:02.860
ASNOVA was a formalist group--

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:06.220
the capitalist individualist
prefers the horizontal line

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:07.510
and immobile column.

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:10.870
The socialist prefers the street
climbing, horizontal line,

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:14.080
the spiral, and
so on, and so on.

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:19.060
What is extraordinary in all
of this revolutionary rhetoric

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.310
is the significance
of the visual image.

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:27.060
The propaganda train--

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:30.240
I mean, imagine building
a propaganda train.

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.860
You're in a civil war.

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:37.970
You just about still
fighting with Germany,

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:43.400
and you paint a train to go
through Russia celebrating

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.910
the new idea of Russia.

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:53.660
The preference that people gave
to the visual impact of power

00:50:53.660 --> 00:51:00.060
distribution-- you will see
it after '35 in the return

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:00.560
to what--

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:07.010
Marx was very impressed
by the Rubens paintings,

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:11.060
because they were large,
and covered enormous things

00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:13.370
that you could identify with.

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:18.620
His version of the emotional
response of people to artifacts

00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:21.530
was exaggerated.

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:25.370
Abstraction, which
was really very much

00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:31.370
the platform of
people like Malevich,

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:36.320
and Lissitzky, and Chernikhov,
and all of these people--

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:37.730
those are great artists--

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:44.850
were competing not around the
social premise of the work,

00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:50.460
but who could, as in
the ASNOVA group--

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:55.320
create a visual formula
which would emotionally

00:51:55.320 --> 00:52:00.750
convince people that they were
in an alternative setting.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.790
I don't know of
any other examples,

00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:06.720
other than in Fascist
power principles, where

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:13.020
a certain emphasis on verbal
rhetoric was not very much use.

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:17.550
People tend to see with their
eyes without being trained.

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:19.980
People can't-- most of
the population of Russia

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:20.595
couldn't read.

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:30.990
The second group, the OSA group,
the group with Moisei Ginzburg,

00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:33.450
and the [? Bach ?] brothers,
and the Vesnin brothers,

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:39.540
and [? Lissitzky, ?] and so
on was a functionalist group.

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:43.920
They say it's scientific
socialism and functionalism.

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:48.210
The ideological value of
proletarian architecture

00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:50.490
does not lie in the
exterior forms, which

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:58.100
act as organs of perception, but
in the scientific functioning

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:01.370
and spatial organization of
the practical problems involved

00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:04.090
in the practical
realization of socialism.

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:11.660
Khrushchev in 1957
said what a waste

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:15.890
of money it was for Stalin to
have wasted all of his money

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:18.950
building [? Lermontov ?]
University in the Palace

00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:22.100
of the Soviets, and all
the shit decoration.

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.800
He said, if we stripped
those buildings of it,

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:34.110
we could have housed
another 300,000 students.

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:36.050
The third group
was of [? VAPRA. ?]

00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:39.990
And they were also
a group interested

00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:43.470
in the abstraction of form.

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:46.710
Amongst the OSA
polemics, there were

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:51.430
groups which fundamentally
are distinguished

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:55.440
between the attitudes
towards urbanization.

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:59.580
The sociologist Sabsovich
was an urbanist.

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:01.950
He believed that
the city was still

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:06.180
the center where human activity
will always take place.

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:23.710
He recommended the idea of a
pervasive network of new towns,

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:28.180
about 40,000 people each,
each town being totally

00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:30.190
collectivized, each
[? evident ?] [? to ?]

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:36.820
[? sell ?] and so on, such towns
to be located next to industry

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:37.960
or collective forms.

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:40.720
The disurbanists were
a group of people

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.450
who believed in the
mobility of the individual--

00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:45.790
light houses,
small-scale equipment,

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:50.890
linear settlements along roads
joining industrial centers.

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:56.170
They were very influenced by
the work of Peter Kropotkin, who

00:54:56.170 --> 00:54:58.600
argued about the
decentralization

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:04.210
qualities of the electrical
grid and other emerging

00:55:04.210 --> 00:55:05.620
technologies.

00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:11.290
For them, an ideal
place was that you had--

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:14.020
there were apartment blocks
being designed according

00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:17.860
to this formula, where each
person in the apartment block

00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:21.760
had a cell of x
number square meters,

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:24.700
barely large enough
for one person,

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:28.930
and the rest of the space
for collective activity.

00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:31.470
Or some of them
even had, in turn,

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:40.465
proposed internal
gymnastic tracks.

00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:46.690
The idea of the
social condenser--

00:55:46.690 --> 00:55:49.630
the ground floor of a
building by Moisei Ginzburg

00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:54.820
had nothing other than
place to condense.

00:55:54.820 --> 00:56:02.020
The vertical system had nothing
other than Fourier's interior

00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:07.460
for people to meet
accidentally and to socialize.

00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:09.970
The whole apartment
block was conceived

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:15.350
as a system of socialization,
as in Krushchev's

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:17.890
Microraion settlements.

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:24.430
Following [? Karmatzoff ?]
in Vienna,

00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:33.220
an early environment broken down
to about 1,800 people per block

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:39.730
would form a collective in which
the socialization element would

00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:40.780
be fundamental.

00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:46.710
I'm trying to rush through all
of this as quickly as I can.

00:56:50.400 --> 00:57:00.630
So for OSA, notions of
linear form based partly

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:04.770
upon the American example
of the conveyor belt--

00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:08.460
"Let us take this storm of the
revolution in Russia, united

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:10.320
with the path of
life in America,

00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:13.230
and do our work
like a chronometer."

00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:16.230
That's Chernikhov.

00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:21.900
Taylorism-- F. W. Taylor of
Harvard University, literature

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:24.660
about industrial
affinity and management.

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:29.700
Lenin exhorted his society
to make use of Taylorism.

00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:38.010
Stalingrad tractor plants
were prefabricated in Detroit

00:57:38.010 --> 00:57:41.670
by the Albert Kahn Company.

00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:48.290
[? Forzazia ?] became a premise
[? Forderization. ?] "Men stand

00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:51.165
still, but things
move," became a mantra.

00:57:56.600 --> 00:58:00.965
The authors write, automobile
factory Gor'kiy was designed

00:58:00.965 --> 00:58:03.350
under the supervision
of the Ford Company.

00:58:03.350 --> 00:58:07.730
Albert Kahn, who is one of
America's more interesting

00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:13.670
architects, his company had
a hand in over 50 enterprises

00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:15.110
in the USA.

00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:17.870
He was supposed to work
primarily for Henry Ford.

00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:25.400
Interesting--
Albert Kahn's a Jew.

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:27.920
Henry Ford is an anti-Semite.

00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:31.220
The Russians dislike Jews.

00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:34.340
But somehow, again, you
have a complete breakdown

00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:37.190
of any kind of thing but skill.

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:40.430
Albert Kahn is the world's
greatest industrial architect,

00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:41.300
probably ever.

00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:46.990
He provided things which
the Russian society

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:52.110
were willing to accept, even
although he was a foreigner.

00:58:52.110 --> 00:59:00.420
And imagine Russia in
this post-Czarist state,

00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:06.660
with a loose ideology,
which we're all

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:11.370
sitting in rooms trying to
say, what does this all mean?

00:59:11.370 --> 00:59:14.670
And here's the United
States, churning away,

00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:17.370
building Ford
automobiles in Detroit,

00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:21.150
and reading about
Taylorism, and so on.

00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:24.420
And the society is
coming closer together

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:27.540
around the production of goods.

00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:30.120
As far as urbanization
is concerned,

00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:31.080
it meant very little.

00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:34.470
The linear plans for the
competition in Magnitogorsk

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:39.000
and Stalingrad,
and [? Ortestroy ?]

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:43.710
for the production of
cars, tractors, and steel.

00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:48.420
The linear settlements--
linearity--

00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:50.530
I wish I had five
minutes to talk

00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:53.040
about the problems of linearity.

00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:57.360
Linearity offers great
attraction to architects

00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:58.860
because it's elementary.

01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:07.060
Expansion is feasible because
you've got two open ends.

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:09.490
You can provide public
transportation system

01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:14.140
along the line, where
it's most efficient.

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:18.280
The crossings of the
line are unimportant.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:22.600
In the Stalingrad
plan, you have a park.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:28.660
You have housing, a park,
industry, and so on, and so on,

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:33.580
like a complicated McDonald's
sandwich stretching infinitely

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.830
in length.

01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:37.480
One of the most interesting--

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:41.200
I'm jumping-- one of the
most interesting competitions

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.090
in urbanism--

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:45.070
competitions in
urbanism are very

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:51.520
difficult. If you examine
the context of a city

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:55.060
as closely as we've been
examining them in this class,

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:59.260
you probably would have to do
a lot to provide a competition,

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:02.425
unless it's for a small
piece of a city, parts

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:03.640
of the inner city.

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:07.930
But a competition
for a whole city,

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:10.900
unless you're
interested in big ideas,

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:16.050
I don't know a successful
urban design competition yet.

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:23.280
One of the more
interesting cases

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:29.100
is the case of the la
Ville Vert competition.

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:33.210
Just after the
Revolution, the Russians

01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:38.400
decided that they needed to
create a new town near Moscow,

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.670
which would alleviate the
workers from the strain

01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:44.250
of working so hard--

01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:46.170
that they could
come to this town

01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:50.730
to spend a week
or two weeks just

01:01:50.730 --> 01:01:55.120
dealing with the world
of fantasy, and so on.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.070
The three winning
competitions were

01:01:57.070 --> 01:02:00.930
by Ladovsky, who
built a town which

01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:03.630
balanced trains and
automobiles, but did

01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:06.420
nothing particularly else.

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:13.710
The second prize competition
was won by Moisei Ginzburg

01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:15.900
and his colleague--

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:19.980
I forget the name
of his colleague--

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:26.850
who proposed the system of
ribbon roads and the train

01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:27.370
system.

01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:31.140
But the basic system was a
disurbanist proposition--

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:35.490
that people would have little
huts, live in the countryside,

01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:48.120
connected by electricity,
and basically

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:54.315
living in the rural areas as if
they were free, like animals.

01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:04.800
The housing was designed on the
basis of one person per unit.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.280
If you were married, you had
a sliding door between the two

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.450
of the units.

01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:14.160
You could transgress that
part as freely as you wished.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.180
But if you didn't want to do
it, you could be separate,

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:20.880
and in an anarchic
sense, perhaps

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:26.790
choose another partner for
the time that you were there.

01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:31.650
The most interesting example
came from a strange man called

01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:34.830
Melnikov, who was one of the
most brilliant architects

01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:38.790
of the modern period
anywhere, and one of the least

01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:40.710
understood.

01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:47.460
Melnikov did everything strange.

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:52.020
He said that everything
that the human being has

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:57.150
to experience in my
town is going to put him

01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:59.490
in a different state of mind.

01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:04.980
So he said, [? let us ?]
study sleep.

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.250
He said we sleep for
a third of our life.

01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:12.000
I'm going to try to influence
the way people sleep.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.520
So the interior is
units of sloping beds.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.910
And he plays sounds into the--

01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:26.730
Roxy Roth of New York
heard about this,

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:32.640
and came to Russia to meet
with Melnikov, to popularize

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:37.290
the idea of putting smells into
American radios and Radio City

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:38.130
Music Hall.

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:47.380
Melnikov wanted wild
animals to roam around,

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:51.840
so that you could really
be in contact with nature

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.790
in a serious manner.

01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:56.810
How serious, I don't know.

01:04:56.810 --> 01:05:00.420
The intimacy between a wild
animal and a human being

01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.205
is pretty serious.

01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:07.400
He had a whole bunch
of other things.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:10.560
He had an Institute for
the Reform of Character.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:14.100
He had the virtual--

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:17.550
the edge of his city was
almost like the walls

01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:23.370
of an ancient town, where
people could go on long walks

01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:26.670
and meet other people.

01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:29.280
You enter his town by train.

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.140
The train stopped
in the station.

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:34.260
I'll show you the slides.

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:37.290
You get out of the train
and you sit in bleachers,

01:05:37.290 --> 01:05:38.530
and you are socialized.

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:46.450
You're given large, dramatic
presentations, and so on.

01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:52.710
It's an extraordinary
place from its interest

01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:57.690
in the individual's experience
throughout these two weeks

01:05:57.690 --> 01:05:59.640
there.

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:02.910
In relation to nature,
he used solar energy,

01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:04.650
had a solar energy pavilion.

01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:07.080
This was long
before solar energy

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.925
was appropriate in our society.

01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:19.210
Let's look at some
of illustrations.

01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:22.570
I'm sorry for this
compressed version,

01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:26.040
but there's very good
writing now available.

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:28.630
And the [? Talkov's ?]
basic book

01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:32.870
is still a very good source.

01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:35.470
So let's look at some
of these images--

01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:41.510
Abercrombie's plan for
London, the clearing away

01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:43.480
of the space around
the center city

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:49.840
and the creation of
a green belt. Next--

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:52.270
I'm going to go through
these very quickly--

01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:57.160
the typical for Mark
One town, one center,

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.962
microcenters in
the neighborhoods.

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.470
This is Welwyn Garden City.

01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:15.840
Next, Stevenage, and the
center of a Mark One new town.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:19.510
Next, Mark Two--

01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:26.110
Hook, a linear city with
a linear center space,

01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:30.470
built above a tunnel.

01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:34.900
And as you can see, the arrows
pointing in the upper section

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:37.030
pointing to the fact
that you have to move

01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:41.380
through others' neighborhoods.

01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:45.190
This is social engineering
through the form

01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:50.350
of distribution of the housing.

01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:58.430
Next, Runcorn, one of the
more revolutionary towns,

01:07:58.430 --> 01:08:05.120
based on a public transportation
route in a figure eight,

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.640
meeting in the
center of the place.

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:13.240
Next, and the
great Cumbernauld--

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:15.280
these are the
diagrams of the center

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:19.450
which fascinated the
architecture world so greatly.

01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:27.770
Next, on the left, you can
see the architecture use

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:33.260
of airplanes and helicopters,
which Frank Lloyd Wright used.

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:36.830
I don't know why it's
important to animate the sky

01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:39.470
in the depiction of a town.

01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:43.069
Everybody does it,
but nobody suffers

01:08:43.069 --> 01:08:48.520
the disaster of Cumbernauld
as Cumbernauld did.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:54.990
Next, Irvine, the linear
town, linking through--

01:08:54.990 --> 01:09:00.180
no, don't change
that, thank you.

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:06.810
And an earlier version of
Milton Keynes on the right,

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:09.060
the distributed, gridded city.

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:14.590
Next, Milton Keynes,
the diagram on the right

01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:18.130
indicates the increase
in affluence--

01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:24.939
leisure, sport,
automobiles, highways.

01:09:24.939 --> 01:09:28.720
The plan of Milton Keynes
is a sectorial plan,

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:32.410
in which the grid
system is carefully

01:09:32.410 --> 01:09:37.420
designed at one kilometer
by one kilometer.

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:40.600
One mile by one mile
would have created

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:47.729
the need for separated
highway connections.

01:09:47.729 --> 01:09:51.510
The volume of automobiles
at one kilometer

01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:56.160
restricts the system of
connections to a traffic light.

01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:04.460
Next, another principle here
is an interesting principle

01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:08.390
for those of you who are
interested in these kind

01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.930
of things.

01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:23.750
In architectural
construction, if I

01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:26.690
create a truss
between two points,

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:32.750
I can load the system anywhere
because the system will take

01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:37.130
care of the load distribution.

01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:46.130
The same principle
is attempted here.

01:10:49.690 --> 01:10:52.810
It's going the wrong way.

01:10:52.810 --> 01:10:56.530
OK, there we are, thank you.

01:10:56.530 --> 01:11:00.130
The system is designed so that
the system, no matter where

01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:06.110
you locate, can be taken care
of by the transportation system.

01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:08.680
In other words, you're
creating the design

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:18.310
of the town, a robust enough
system of moving infrastructure

01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:20.720
so that any loading position--

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:23.440
say an industry which
is to locate here,

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.330
another industry here--

01:11:25.330 --> 01:11:29.215
all of it is taken care of
by the infrastructure design.

01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:41.240
Next, here are just two examples
from a Venezuelan project

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:45.470
called El Tablazo, which
is the same firm which did

01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:49.310
Milton Keynes, designed
at the same time.

01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:52.250
The whole idea is that
the center of the town

01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:58.220
would be a zone for
squatters, that the incubation

01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:02.540
requirement in the
middle of a city

01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:07.130
heightens the educational
input into these people,

01:12:07.130 --> 01:12:09.670
and they can then
migrate from here

01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:14.390
into an existing
surrounding neighborhood.

01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:17.370
It was never built.

01:12:17.370 --> 01:12:26.100
Next, Russia, hell
on Earth, the image

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:29.940
of contemporary
capitalist industry--

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:36.510
this is from Miliutin's
book, Sotsgorod in 1919,

01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:39.840
the use of visual material
in the celebration

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.110
of the new republic.

01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:51.820
Next, Ernst May of the German
architects and his institute,

01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:57.660
who did the distributed
plan for Moscow.

01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:01.920
Corbusier's plan
on the bottom left.

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:05.610
Next, [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:05.610 --> 01:13:08.310
This is one of the more
interesting plans of Moscow,

01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:11.460
[? Kirov's ?] plan.

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:15.870
Basically, if a city
expands, the tension

01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:21.300
is in the environment around the
area which it's expanding into.

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:23.040
What do you do with that?

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:27.090
You see all of these
projects are uncertain.

01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:30.240
You either have a green
belt. You restrict growth.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.110
If you do growth, this
one tries to capitalize

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:39.090
on the communal environment
at the edge of the city--

01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:47.470
a huge infrastructure of
sport, recreation, open space,

01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:51.090
and so on encircles Moscow.

01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:52.920
The only version
of this that I know

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:57.600
is in Havana in Lenin
Park surrounding Havana,

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:03.150
where you have, in a sense,
an encultured green belt

01:14:03.150 --> 01:14:05.940
of modest size.

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:08.640
One of the [INAUDIBLE]
[? Moscovit ?] plan,

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.340
which is similar to
Alan Smythe's plan--

01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:15.750
that is to distribute roads
and rail systems all around

01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:18.300
in fingered form,
in linear form,

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:24.450
and to have small interventions
in linear form along these.

01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:32.430
Next, this is [? Shushev's ?]
plan, and the 1935 plan,

01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:35.610
which became the orthodox
plan, which Moscow's

01:14:35.610 --> 01:14:37.770
followed roughly ever since.

01:14:37.770 --> 01:14:43.290
Next, this is the
Ladovsky's plan

01:14:43.290 --> 01:14:46.020
for the Ville Vert competition.

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:54.180
Next, this is Ginzburg's
plan on the left,

01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:57.930
mainly with [INAUDIBLE],,
linear road systems,

01:14:57.930 --> 01:15:04.230
and green filled in between,
in some version between a grid

01:15:04.230 --> 01:15:06.840
system and a dotted system.

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.990
And on the right is the
diagram of Melnikov's plan,

01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:15.150
with an elephant in the center
and a bull up at the top.

01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:20.280
Next, here is these
entries to the city.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:24.870
This is how you
enter into number 15.

01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:29.310
You are socialized
on your entry.

01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:32.100
What that means,
god alone knows.

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:36.150
Here's a bedroom, which
is articulated in relation

01:15:36.150 --> 01:15:38.250
to the sun, and into sleep.

01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:41.640
And here's a solar
pavilion on the left.

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:48.340
Imagine designing a
solar pavilion in 1919.

01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:51.130
Next is extraordinary.

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:54.250
That's one of his drawings on
the right for the new Ministry

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:55.570
of Industry.

01:15:55.570 --> 01:15:57.310
And this is in--

01:15:57.310 --> 01:16:02.660
sketch from 1924, Exhibition
Pavilion in Paris,

01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:07.300
which was built, but not quite
as dramatically as the diagram.

01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:14.946
Next, the OSA group, in all of
their scientific formulations--

01:16:14.946 --> 01:16:17.590
here are the two
based on linearity.

01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:22.000
Next, the plan on the right
is of a linear distribution

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.860
of a connection between
separated settlements

01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:31.660
and a linear system
in Stalingrad.

01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:35.320
The drawing on the
left is interesting.

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.690
One of the great
skills of urban design

01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:41.650
is the skill of diagramming.

01:16:41.650 --> 01:16:45.160
You need to be able to
diagram very well in order

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.770
to convey your intentions
to your colleagues,

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:49.630
to other people, and so on.

01:16:52.870 --> 01:17:04.300
The diagramming system here
uses simple forms of description

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:06.670
to animate the big idea.

01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:12.550
Next, here, you can
see Leonidov's idea

01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:16.090
for distributed
disurbanist environment,

01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:19.390
of huts connected and urban.

01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:26.110
Next, just a few
glances at housing.

01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:29.920
Here in the diagram of this
housing project on the right,

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:32.260
the ground floor
is, as you can see,

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:37.150
occupied with
people condensing--

01:17:37.150 --> 01:17:40.680
condensing, playing
sport, playing.

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:46.540
Here on the left is a
diagram for projecting

01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:50.650
the power of the
[INAUDIBLE] [? interior, ?]

01:17:50.650 --> 01:17:55.510
the central position, which
links to a number of floors

01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:56.620
through the building.

01:17:56.620 --> 01:18:04.850
Next, Moisei Ginzburg's
modern apartment block.

01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:09.710
The ground floor and the
roof are totally given over

01:18:09.710 --> 01:18:14.660
to communal space, and
the floors in between

01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:18.500
are small and compartmentalized.

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:23.120
Here's a project for a
residential environment

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.070
combining a number
of the features

01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:29.090
of these intellectual groups,
the advertising of the building

01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:32.300
giving the visual prominence
to the shape of the building.

01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:39.500
There's a wheel.

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:41.600
I don't know if the
wheel articulates

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:45.200
the idea of the elevator
going up and down.

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:55.090
Next, this is the
projection by one

01:18:55.090 --> 01:18:57.940
of these groups for the
housing in the Magnitogorsk

01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:59.230
competition.

01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:03.650
This is, in fact,
on the right, what

01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:06.310
was built as the result
of the competition.

01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:16.370
Next, this is Melnikov's
cinema in Moscow.

01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:20.850
Imagine making three separate
buildings out of a cinema.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.330
On the left is
one of Corbusier's

01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:32.560
lesser-known buildings, this
[? Enthroysius ?] building,

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:40.150
a 1929 building for the United
Workers Councils of Russia.

01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:43.900
It's now the Bureau of
Statistics building.

01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:53.380
Next, the Dom-Kommuna building
on the left, the social housing

01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:57.010
built under the
Dom-Kommuna system.

01:19:57.010 --> 01:20:00.920
On the right is a club.

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:07.120
Next, these are
just two diagrams.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:10.930
Here is Tatlin's famous
Monument to the International

01:20:10.930 --> 01:20:11.860
on the left.

01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:14.500
On the right is
Melnikov's the entry

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.540
into the Pravda competition.

01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:21.160
All of them involve the building
moving at different rates.

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:24.700
In the Pravda
competition building,

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:28.150
the separate cores
of the building

01:20:28.150 --> 01:20:31.480
rotate the building
at different speeds.

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:34.210
It's the invasion of
architecture by movement.

01:20:34.210 --> 01:20:37.000
This Monument to
the International

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:43.600
has also rotating
geometric forms

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.760
which move at different speeds.

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:48.890
It's much like when
the Queen is in London,

01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:51.880
there's a flag on
Buckingham Palace.

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:55.450
You will know when
Congress is in session

01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:58.120
by watching the speed of the--

01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:02.910
more like an urban
thermometer, somehow.
