00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.800
PROFESSOR: So in the
last part of the course,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.390
we'll discuss the fluid
mechanics of indoor spaces,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.180
in particular, going
beyond the approximation

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.360
of a well-mixed room when
considering airborne disease

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.450
transmission.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.890
So for example, we will
consider the occupants

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.180
of a room and their
respiratory activity.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.810
So when they breathe, especially
if they're not wearing a mask,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.770
or if they cough, they're
going to have turbulent plumes

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.570
emitting from their
mouth, which will then

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.420
be convected throughout
the room and will influence

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.100
other people.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.510
Also, the heat of the
body relative to the room

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.010
can lead to warmer air, which
is rising, so that essentially

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.140
sort of a chimney
of a thermal plume

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.940
rising from an individual.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.700
Those heterogeneities
in the flow

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.250
and in the concentration
of aerosol particles

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.000
may not always be well-mixed.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.660
We'll talk about different
types of ventilation,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.200
how, for example, cold air
will sink from the place

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.660
where it's inserted
and warm air will rise.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.750
And that may or may
not lead to sufficient

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.789
mixing to remain well-mixed.

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.050
And we'll talk about how
to modify our criterion

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.700
for airborne
disease transmission

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.240
in a well-mixed room to account
for some of these changes,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.060
in particular the heightened
risk of short-range

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.270
transmission from being
directly in the path

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.390
of respiratory puffs
and plumes emanating

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.990
from an infected person.
