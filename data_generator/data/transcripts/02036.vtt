00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.980
PROFESSOR: So as an
aside, for those of you

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.360
who have an understanding
of probability

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.850
theory and stochastic
processes, let

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.950
me just explain why it is valid
to bound the main transmission

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.520
rate in defining the indoor
reproductive number when

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.740
we might be more
concerned about bounding

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.360
the probability
of a transmission.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.970
So let's let a capital T
be a random variable which

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.530
describes the random
number of transmissions

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.490
that occur in the room.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.690
And this is specifically for
the case for one infector

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.830
or infected person and
n minus 1 susceptible.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.690
So again, the situation of
the reproductive number where

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.550
for every person that
comes in we want to know

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.960
is there going to
be transmission,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.560
and typically, only one
infected person would be seen.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.550
So this is a random variable,
and let's let ft of n

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.460
be the probability
density function that

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.810
gives the probability of
little n transmissions.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:37.590
And then we can define the risk
of a transmission, the risk

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:47.229
of at least one transmission,
as the probability

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.170
that this random variable
takes on a value, which

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.190
is greater than or equal to 1.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.690
OK.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.450
Well, in terms of the
probability density function

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:05.200
then, that would be a sum from
1 to infinity of the ft event,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.710
basically.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.720
So we're just adding
the probabilities

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.730
that we're not seeing a
transmission to those--

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.870
or possible transition to those
different numbers of people.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.660
Now I'd like to do
a little calculation

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.620
to get an upper bound
on this quantity.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.490
So we can say that
this is less than

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.280
or equal to the
sum from n equals 1

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.470
to infinity of n ft of n.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.910
Now, this is just a
mathematical trick here.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.560
So n refers to the natural
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, et cetera.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.310
Those are all positive
numbers and they're

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.600
all greater than or equal to 1.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.520
So if I take 1 in this
expression over here

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.140
and replace it
with little n, I'm

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.110
only increasing the value
of that sum, because also,

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.910
this ft is a probability
density that has to be positive.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.790
And then now I can also
say that this is actually

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.740
equal to throwing in n equals
0, because that is a term that

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.180
is actually identically 0.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.790
So I can change the summation.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.930
And then by definition
here, this thing

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.560
is the expected value of
the number of transmissions,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.079
because I'm summing the
number of transmissions

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.380
little n times the probability
of that event occurring.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.829
So that is the definition
of the average.

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:29.420
So what we're seeing here is
that the risk of a transmission

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.800
is rigorously bounded
above by the expected

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.900
number of transmissions.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.810
And so therefore, if we require
that this is less than epsilon,

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.780
our risk tolerance that
we've just introduced,

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:58.090
this is a conservative bound
on the true risk, which let's

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.690
say here is defined by rt.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.950
So if your goal is to control
the probability of having

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.720
at least one
transmission, so basically

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.150
to ensure that no
transmissions occur,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.030
then you would do well to
bound the expected number

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.160
of transmissions, because
that's an upper bound.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.029
It can also be shown
that as epsilon

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.209
goes to 0, so we're talking
about very low probabilities

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.360
of transmission, and
oftentimes that is the case,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.140
then rt is asymptotically
the same as the expected

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.140
number of transmissions.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.010
So this overall risk of a
transmission and the expected

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.420
number are the same.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.130
And in fact, that's
one way to understand

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.590
sort of even the
definition of a probability

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.590
in terms of an expected
number of events.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.450
And we are typically
thinking of cases where

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.880
epsilon is much less than 1.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.940
So for those of you that have
some background in probability,

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.310
you may recognize that
what I've just done here

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.000
is an example of a much
more general result, which

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.870
is called Markov's Inequality.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.860
So now we can safely
proceed by continuing

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.410
to work with average values of
all the quantities of interest.
