00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.810
PROFESSOR: So now we're
ready to synthesize

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.940
our knowledge of
airborne transmission

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.570
in a well-mixed room and
epidemiological models

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.060
to arrive at a safety
guideline to limit

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.240
the indoor airborne
spread of COVID-19,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.120
or, more generally, other
respiratory pathogens.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.409
Existing guidelines
limit one parameter

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:33.700
that might be important.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.300
For example, social
distancing limits the spacing

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.670
between people,
which can be defined

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.070
by the average area per occupant
for example, to a minimum

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.350
of, say, 6 feet or 1 meter.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.350
Other rules, for
example, adopted here

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.070
in the state of Massachusetts,
limit all gatherings

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.000
to be no larger than
25 persons indoors.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.960
There also are recommendations
from heating and ventilation

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.440
societies that may recommend
we increase the fresh air

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.730
change rate to six or higher.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.260
In the UK, for example,
the fresh air flow rate

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.480
might be prescribed to 10
liters per second per person

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.770
or other such numbers.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.560
Also the time that
an infected person

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.480
is in the presence
of susceptible people

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.150
might be limited
to say, 15 minutes.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.270
That's involved in the
definition of a contact

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.070
here in the United States.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.770
So what we will see is
that it's really not

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.259
possible to write down a
realistic guideline that

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.770
bounds any one quantity, because
there will always be situations

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.530
where you either
are too conservative

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.729
or are not careful enough
in bounding that quantity,

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.690
because these qualities
are all related.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.080
So, for example,
25 persons might

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.360
be perfectly safe in
a very large space

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.270
for a very short amount of time
with very high ventilation.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.170
But take those 25 persons and
seal them into a small tent,

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.590
breathing each other's
air for 24 hours with very

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.500
little ventilation, it's a
completely different situation.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.240
And the same holds
for the distance,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.100
or the time, or the flow
rates, everything is mixed.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.560
And then what about
other variables

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.210
that we don't
explicitly control?

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.960
Like relative humidity
or filtration efficiency,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.570
if you're using filters
to filter the air.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.100
Or if you're wearing masks.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.910
The quality of the masks,
how well does that come in?

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.820
How about the
volume of the space?

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.570
It's not just the flow
rate, but it's also

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.270
the geometry, even the area,
or the length of the space.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.020
So somehow all these
variables must be related,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.360
and the goal of this chapter
is to derive that relationship

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.240
for the case of a
well-mixed room, where it's

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.700
a unique universal guideline.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.700
And to parameterize this
specifically for COVID-19,

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.700
by looking at a variety of
superspreading events for which

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.980
enough data is available
that we can make

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.660
a reasonable and consistent
inference of the infectiousness

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.020
of exhaled breath.
