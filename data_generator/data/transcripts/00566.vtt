00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.960
JULIAN BEINART: Let me tell you
what I've handed out to you.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.090
My argument is that race
is the significant factor

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.410
in urban history
of South Africa.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.630
I will justify that at
the beginning of my talk.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:55.640
Secondly, the form of
Johannesburg from 1876 onwards

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.110
can be judged in terms of
the location of Black people

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.710
and attitudes
towards Black people.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.200
Essentially, apartheid
as a philosophy

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.260
regarded cities as
violently against the norm,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.500
which would keep Black people in
rural or semi-rural situations

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.930
by tribe.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.140
There's an old colonial method
of dealing with the population.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.010
And that's by keeping them
in a tribal situation.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.660
The city, at its
most magnificent,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.890
is an educative instrument,
an enabler of change.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.280
Change is what South
Africa was trying to avoid.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.690
That is the hegemony of white
people over Black people.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.050
And the city becomes a
phenomenally important

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.490
instrument.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.610
I will try to take
you through the five

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:10.340
stages of South African urbanism
in the case of Johannesburg--

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.470
the mining camp from 1876--

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.770
well, 1885 to 1917, the informal
city, the rationalized city,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.880
the regional city, and
the current open city,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.780
post-apartheid city.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.590
I will look at the detail in the
second city, the informal city.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.340
That is of a township called
Western Native Township,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.550
which consisted of
15,000 people living

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.230
in 2,000 houses, the
first public housing

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:56.480
buildings in Johannesburg
during the influenza epidemic.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.330
Every time public
action takes place,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.780
spatially it's in
a site which is

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:10.430
considered to be either a
dump site of some low value.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:21.320
And often the decision occurs
because of some disease.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.460
The first movement out of
the mining camp in 1904

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.030
occurs because of
the plague epidemic.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.420
And who happens to be, in South
Africa, the most important man

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.850
ever to live in South Africa
even for a short time?

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.436
Who is that?

00:03:37.436 --> 00:03:38.660
AUDIENCE: Mahatma Gandhi.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.618
JULIAN BEINART: Gandhi.

00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:41.780
Yes, of course.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.980
Gandhi learnt his politics in
South Africa before returning

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.490
to India.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.020
And he was in Johannesburg.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:58.340
And the Indian township,
which was burnt down

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.450
because of the
plague, he interceded

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.570
with the Transvaal government
to allow the people to return

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.000
at night to dig in their
basements to retrieve gold

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.400
which they had stored away.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.940
Anyway, Western Native Township
is the first publicly built

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.820
housing for Black people.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:31.550
I want to examine it
from 1917 to 1965.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.310
If those of you've read what
I've written about this,

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.780
the story of Western
Native Township

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.720
appeared on the cover of
three architectural magazines

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:49.280
in three parts of the
world in September 1966.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.890
So it's a fairly
well-known story.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.300
I'm repeating it
for the 999th time.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.270
And I hope it's not
too boring for you.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:09.440
The second page is a
summary of the location

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.030
of Black people over time.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.210
You will see that
Black people are

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.650
moved from the center of the
city further outwards in one

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.500
vector towards the southwest.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.670
The bar graphs below indicates--

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.050
when we look at this
slide, I'll indicate

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.440
some of these subtleties.

00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:48.390
The solid black is
housing by the public.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.410
The horizontal line is
housing by the private sector.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.530
You will see at the
beginning of Soweto, the--

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.420
yeah, no.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.250
I'll go to this in some detail.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.020
I have to worry
about time because we

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.110
cover a lot of stuff.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.490
The graph showing
cumulative housing built

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:18.810
indicates that the attempt to
marshall the Black population

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.690
in the city took an
enormous leap in number

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.980
from about 1950 onward.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.455
This was the building
of the major part

00:06:31.455 --> 00:06:36.652
of Soweto, population of
about 1.5 million people.

00:06:36.652 --> 00:06:38.610
AUDIENCE: Is this is a
public housing building?

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.443
JULIAN BEINART: Yes.

00:06:39.443 --> 00:06:40.218
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:06:40.218 --> 00:06:41.385
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah, sorry.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.005
The next few pages deal with
Western Native Township.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:06.120
These two pages which follow
are a little difficult

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.770
to follow, but deal
with the four stages

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.390
in the life and death of
this township in regard

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.990
to a number of things,
the social organization.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:29.340
This research was done
from the Black newspapers,

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.560
which have a long tradition
in South African journalism.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:44.760
Much of this data is transcribed
by one of my Black assistants

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.810
doing this work.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:55.360
It's an extraordinarily
difficult piece of work to do.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.370
We had to justify
some of the comments

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.130
about gangs, about
the origins of jazz

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:09.040
and so on, through
interview with older people

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.570
to justify some of it.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.990
Although this is social
science research,

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:20.230
which approximates things
more than anything else.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:28.550
The next page is a quote
from a book on fascism,

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.160
architectural fascism.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.549
The paragraph which
I marked, I think,

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:40.220
explains the formal
declaration of this township

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:46.760
on the walls, which I will go
to into some detail with you,

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.690
as a piece of
reconstruction of nature.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:55.670
And I think this paragraph,
which deals largely

00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:00.020
with our classical
architecture works,

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.350
deal very well with the
issue of the facade.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:06.380
And the last page
is just one example

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.700
of the facades of these houses.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:31.810
So to return to the
beginning, racial segregation

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:35.980
underlies all urban
history in South Africa.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:42.970
It's the most extreme version
of segregation based legally

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.395
on the basis of race.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:52.650
Had South Africa not
legislated race legally,

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.980
the rest of the world
would have left it alone.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.870
There's discrimination on the
basis of race in the American

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:05.220
South still today, although
the central government

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:12.510
has acted in civil rights
issues after many years of not

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:16.740
doing anything about it.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.490
But in South Africa, from
the earliest times onwards,

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:25.230
there was a move reinforced
by the Dutch Reformed Church

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.520
to regard Blacks as
temporary inhabitants

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.060
although they were the
majority of the society.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:37.530
In 1904, a government
white paper says,

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.560
"let them understand that
the towns of the colony

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.670
are the special birthplace and
abode for the white man who

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.920
are the governing race."

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.600
This is 1904.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.720
My god, South Africa only
became a country in 1910.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.200
This is under British rule,
British colonial rule.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:03.010
1921, "it should be
understood that the town is

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.660
the European area in which
there is no place for the London

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:12.300
native, who neither works
nor serves his or her people.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.450
The town is a white phenomenon.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:20.670
Blacks only visit for
labor temporarily."

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:25.500
Between 1960 and 1985,
one person per minute

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.340
was prosecuted under the
Pass Laws in South Africa.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:35.850
The Pass Laws required for
you to have work continuously

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:40.110
for 10 years for one
employer, for example.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:44.310
If you were in the city and
couldn't fulfill that demand,

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.400
you're prosecuted
under Pass Laws.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:53.310
So you have a white city
and a phenomenally migrant

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:54.570
population--

00:11:54.570 --> 00:12:01.140
migrant not in their
own belief or judgment,

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:07.530
but in the judgment of a
hegemonous white population.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:11.880
Black people are only
there to serve to serve

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:17.655
the whites in cities, 1921

00:12:17.655 --> 00:12:22.280
In 1976, Mr. MC
Botha the minister

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.510
of Bantu Administration--

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.810
again, the use of
terminology is interesting.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:32.940
Blacks, Bantu is a linguistic
group of languages.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.550
The minister of
Bantu administration

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.880
could either be the minister
of Black administration,

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.630
the minister of
native education,

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.240
the minister of
African education,

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.940
or the minister of
Azanian education.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.750
It's one of these
independence group

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.310
named South African Blacks.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:05.240
The use of the racial
denomination is interesting.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.050
Because South Africa
traded with Japan,

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.170
Japanese were considered
white in South Africa.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:13.655
Chinese were considered Black.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:21.000
Colored people or
the miscegenous group

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.900
are considered Black, but
in this special category.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.690
The whole idea is, if you
denominate the population

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:35.820
by tribal group, whites are
the superior race by number.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.210
They beat the number of
Zulu people in South Africa.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:44.040
So if you keep on categorizing
people as Zulu, Xhosa, Tswana,

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:50.070
Khoisan, whatever,
Ndebele, and so on,

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:54.000
you will break down the
society into tribal groups,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.510
which the whites are
the superior group.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:05.370
It's an incredibly interesting
and awful phenomenon,

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:09.090
which comes out of
this doctrine, whereby

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:14.370
the doctrine is that the city
is a polluting environment.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.770
It causes people to change.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:18.090
It educates people.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:22.020
And that's frightening because
it educates people to move out

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.220
of hegemony of
tribalism where you

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.920
live according to
code of behavior

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.860
and moving to the cities where
they become industrial workers,

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:39.960
join trade unions, and are
open to political democracy.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:44.160
So the South African
experience is fundamentally

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.440
important for those
of you who are

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.450
interested in the
details of policy

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.810
in order to maintain white--

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:58.410
migrant labor is a phenomenon
all over the world.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.110
Abu Dhabi depends
on migrant labor.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.900
So does Dubai.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.740
The relationship between
Turkey and Germany

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.840
has, for a long time, been a
relationship of migrant labor.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:17.440
India has a phenomenal use
of migrant labor still today,

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.676
an interesting aspect
of Indian urbanism.

00:15:21.676 --> 00:15:23.140
AUDIENCE: Mexico to US.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.680
JULIAN BEINART: Mexico
to US, absolutely.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:32.460
I don't want to get into
a discussion of the values

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.725
or disvalues of migrant labor.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.990
But in the South
African situation,

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:46.620
migrant labor was not only
labor from within South Africa,

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:50.250
but Black labor from
the adjoining countries,

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:57.960
from Zimbabwe, as far away as
Malawi on the basis of service

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:03.840
to the gold mining and
uranium mining industries,

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:09.900
keeping people outside of
the normal family situation,

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:14.220
living in hostels, being
paid money in order

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:19.150
for them to export the money
to the local poor origins.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:33.620
The first city
occurred because gold--

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.665
as I said in a previous class,
Chicago and Johannesburg

00:16:36.665 --> 00:16:42.030
were the two most important
cities of the 19th century.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.815
People can argue.

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:48.260
You can postulate
some other candidates,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:52.970
but which other city is
founded in the 19th century?

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.505
Athens was rebuilt
in the 19th century.

00:16:55.505 --> 00:16:59.220
It was virtually nothing.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.220
But new cities of
the 19th century, I

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:06.030
argue that Johannesburg
and Chicago are the two

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.579
significant examples.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:11.160
Gold was discovered on the reef.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.390
That's the ridge which
Johannesburg is built.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:24.390
And the mining camp
which resulted in a plan

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.869
which I'll show you,
which has very small lots.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:31.410
One of the reasons for making
small lots in a mining camp

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:34.950
is that there are
many corner blocks.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:38.220
The corners go to bars.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.170
So you make small lots.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:44.520
Whenever you have to choose a
lot size, the bigger the lot,

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.880
the fewer corners there are.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.800
So you can look at
the plan of Manhattan

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.720
in terms of the
number of corners

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.620
there are in the
geometry and calculate

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.250
how valuable it would have been
had the blocks being shorter

00:17:59.250 --> 00:17:59.840
in length.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:09.090
Léon Krier, whose work we'll
discuss in a few weeks' time,

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:14.250
argues in his plan for Barcelona
the subdivision of the Cerdá

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:25.680
block of 1,000 into 3,000 or
3 times 300 or 4 times 250.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.030
Tel Aviv has very small blocks.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.380
It has enormous
traffic problems caused

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.580
by the blocks are too small.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.440
Traffic conditions
are bad enough

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.860
in Manhattan given the long
length of the blocks east-west,

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:47.295
but we're not talking about
Manhattan at the moment.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.080
Gold attracts
people very quickly.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.370
And 10 years after
Johannesburg's birth,

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.710
there were 100,000
people in the city.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:03.840
50% were Black, Africans,
Malays, coloreds, Indians,

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.510
and Chinese.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:11.655
Each of these groups was located
in what is called a location.

00:19:11.655 --> 00:19:15.420
A location is a
British colonial term

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:20.100
for locating people whom
you consider to be workers.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:25.400
And generally, they are Black or
colored in some form or other.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.590
We find locations in
Zimbabwe and Kenya

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.220
and other parts
of Africa as well.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:40.810
This was a city of primitive
feudal social relationship.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.780
There was a Bantu--

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.520
there was a Kaffir location.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.970
Again, remember, look at
the word, the terminology.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:53.140
Kaffir an Arab word which
refers to bad people.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:20:01.030
Coolie, what does the word
coolie in Indian mean?

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.263
AUDIENCE: It's a worker.

00:20:02.263 --> 00:20:03.680
JULIAN BEINART:
What does it mean?

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.890
AUDIENCE: It's a worker.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:08.520
JULIAN BEINART: A worker,
but it's a pejorative word.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.140
I grew up in South Africa.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:14.445
And I remember buying fruit
from the coolie store.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:23.110
Language indicates intention
fairly well in urbanism.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:28.420
One should be careful what
we word, how we name, things.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:32.560
Numbering street by number
has some implication.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:37.480
Calling a street Merrymount
Street has other implications.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.460
We shouldn't take
this too seriously.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.660
This city ends with the disease.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:53.040
The plague, in 1904, forces the
Emancipation of Black people

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:57.840
immediately out of the
Black, the Kaffir location

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.050
to the site of the
Anglo-Boer war camp

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:04.380
15 kilometers to the southwest.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.400
And that's the origin of Soweto.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:13.510
It's a town called Pimville
where Miriam Makeba comes from,

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.440
a famous Black South
African singer.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.470
And she's known as
Pimm's Number 1.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:24.150
Pimm's Number 1 refers
to a British drink.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:27.870
I'm getting too
sophisticated here,

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:29.625
playing games with language.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:39.810
1917 to 1948, the informal city,
it begins with the influenza

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.240
epidemic of 1917.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:48.450
The cities now face to house
Blacks for the first time.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.900
Next to the municipal
dump, it chooses

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:56.340
to develop Western
Native Township.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.950
The annual expenditure
on Black housing

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.245
is the same as the annual
budget for the zoo.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:08.340
Sophiatown, which is a private
enterprise environment.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:13.160
The cornation formed
the western areas.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.380
This is the
equivalent of Harlem.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.890
It was where African
music, journalism,

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:24.620
African political parties, the
cooperative movement, gangs,

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.350
the nexus of Black
culture develops

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:33.140
in an extraordinary period
of time of about 30 years.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.750
Sophiatown is free held.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:41.060
At that time, about 50% of
Black housing is private.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.280
50% is public.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.880
It's the city of
informal relationships.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.110
There's shared shopping on the
seams, generally Indian shops.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:55.100
There's a strong self-help
identity and many journey

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:59.150
to work options,
including walking to work.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:02.930
The informal cities have
become enormously overcrowded

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.630
with South Africa's
industrialization

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:11.420
in the '39, '45 war
and the South African

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.780
so-called liberal
political parties defeated

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:18.840
in the '48 elections, replaced
by the Afrikaner National

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:19.340
Party.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.450
The Afrikaner National Party--

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:33.480
driven by a number of
fundamentalist initiatives.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.820
The word [AFRIKAANS],, which
is Afrikaans for Black danger,

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.570
is a term which is employed
to threaten white South

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.090
Africans that the
Blacks, who are

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.720
the majority of the
population, will

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.590
destroy the white population
and white civilization.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.980
White civilization
is promoted to the--

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:06.720
South African whites produced
bad German opera whilst Blacks

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.830
were playing jazz based on
American music and music which

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.720
they understood politically.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:23.080
I was part of the South African
jazz movement for a while

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.750
because I had a lot
of jazz material

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.390
from America when I
was in graduate school.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:37.420
And it contrasts, again,
the informal popular notion

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:43.060
of music which, in the
South African case,

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:46.900
in the South African
Black case, migrates

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.850
from playing the
penny whistle, which

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.540
is a very primitive
instrument, to the saxophone.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:57.700
South African jazz musicians
played the alto saxophone

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.190
more than they played
the trumpet, again,

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:02.680
for reasons of
choice, which based

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:06.880
on the kind of
musical vibrations

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.580
that those instruments
gave to them.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:17.310
The whites emulated badly
classical Western German music.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.740
So you have, in the
Western areas, the growth

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.140
of informal movement.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.920
I regard the declaration system
in Western Native Township,

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.230
which we'll discuss
in a few minutes,

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:40.510
as a popular phenomenon,
which people use to make--

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:43.240
well, let's wait
until we get there.

00:25:51.564 --> 00:25:56.790
The notion that Blacks
are a rural people

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:01.140
is manifest in
apartheid religion.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:04.920
It allows one to believe that
Blacks should be returned

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.950
to rural tribal existence.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:14.390
Public housing is built at
low densities, no elevators.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:18.080
Blacks are racially
subdivided into tribes

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.660
in the new apartheid regime.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:25.520
Soweto, Western Native
Township, as you will see,

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.490
did not separate
people by tribe.

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:35.630
This was in the setting
of the informal city.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:43.220
And apartheid Soweto was
allocated into separate ghettos

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.820
of tribal entity.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:50.180
Houses were built,
so that people

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.990
could be seen as rural people.

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.000
The house in Western
Native Township

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.580
was about 250 square feet.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:02.570
It had seven people in it.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:07.340
It had a porch of
100 square feet.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:11.030
The porch was where
people at sundown

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:14.870
should sit and watch
the sun go down

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.100
or the sunrise in the morning.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:22.340
It is absolute nonsense
to build housing

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:26.310
at that density
with an open porch.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:30.350
No wonder that was
70% of the porches

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:34.670
were enclosed, as we will see
in the process of the changes

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:38.000
to the house, adding 100
square foot to the house.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:47.080
There are a couple of other
pieces to the apartheid story.

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:56.100
Between 1955 and
1960, 33,000 houses

00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:00.970
were built, twice as many
as in the previous 37 years.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:04.860
The effort houses a quarter
million people in five years.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.170
In the Johannesburg
brochure, it talks

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:10.460
about it being the biggest
housing project in the world.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:18.390
Why were the houses
not mass-produced?

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.579
Why are they houses built
of bricks and tin roofs?

00:28:26.579 --> 00:28:27.662
AUDIENCE: The were hotels?

00:28:27.662 --> 00:28:28.495
JULIAN BEINART: Hum?

00:28:28.495 --> 00:28:30.970
AUDIENCE: So they
were built as hotels?

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.640
JULIAN BEINART: Not quite,
but it has to do with labor.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:41.770
The Bantu Building Act
eliminated Black labor

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:43.500
from the white
building industry.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.680
Therefore, Black labor could
only build for Black houses.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.540
In 1947, in Jabavu
building costs

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.930
were 1 rand per square foot.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:29:02.980
It dropped to $0.60 per square
foot during the apartheid era.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:06.880
No industrialized building,
only laying bricks--

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.620
the third city is a city of
total insulation, isolation.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:16.540
In Soweto, population of
1.5 million with few shops,

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.210
hardly any entertainment,
the journey

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:23.290
to work cost 300% more
than in the second city,

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:26.095
total reliance on the white
central business district.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.930
In the study of the
white central business

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:33.210
district of Johannesburg,
I was always

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:37.440
puzzled by why some of the most
expensive men's clothing stores

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:41.010
were next to the railway
station for Blacks.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:46.920
And jazz records, the best
record stores, were close by.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:53.720
If you have 1.5 million
people whom you isolate,

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:58.170
there's no apartheid in
the selling of goods.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:01.290
There is only apartheid
in where you live

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:04.230
and where you go to school
and what your relationship

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:05.970
with between race.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:15.110
Shopping is kept open
to multiracial endeavor.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:17.700
The market works that way.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:21.050
So where do the
expensive stores, which

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:26.810
can use the 19th century
train system from Soweto

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:29.730
to Johannesburg,
where do they locate?

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:35.255
They locate very close to
the Black railway station.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:46.520
Very briefly, because we have
to look at a lot of material--

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:54.710
by 1970, the effort
which produced Soweto

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:56.960
could not be sustained.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:01.250
There was no more public
housing built after 1970.

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:07.340
A new urban regional
pattern was conceived of.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:12.410
That is to create a set
of tribal enclaves called

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:20.900
Bantustans, mainly for the
largest for the Zulu and Xhosa,

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.090
the Xhosa in the
Eastern Cape province,

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:25.580
the Zulu in the
Natal, the Tswana,

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:31.710
the only free state in
the Transvaal provinces.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:37.760
The idea would be to induce
within centers factories

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.990
to locate on the borders
of these Bantustans,

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:47.250
again, in an attempt to
frustrate urbanization.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.930
So the pattern of
the new regional city

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:56.030
would have industries
moving out of Johannesburg

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:59.030
locating on the
edges of a Bantustan

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.650
a couple of hundred miles away.

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:05.420
This is the same nonsense
as the empowerment zones

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:08.780
under the Clinton
Administration in this country,

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.150
that you could induce with
the incentives industry.

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:17.370
Industry nourishes
itself on urbanization.

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:22.160
There are reasons industry
are in dense cities, not in--

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:28.700
by and large, in dense cities.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:33.170
Decentralized industry occurs
under special conditions

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:34.740
as well.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:42.260
But the notion that you pay
industry special margins

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:47.990
in order to locate, in order to
maintain Blacks in rural areas

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:56.000
as tribes, is a fantasy only
to be concocted by a regionally

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
illiterate mind.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.030
At one point, South
Africa was contemplating

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:05.060
getting the Japanese
to build a monorail,

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:09.200
to build a train line, from
the Zulu areas in Natal

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:14.195
500 miles to Johannesburg, so
that the industry could locate.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.690
The famous story of David
Goldblatt's photographs

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:25.000
of 3 times 8, a
Black laborer who

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.330
lives in the Ndebele Bantustan
and works in Johannesburg,

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:35.440
spend 8 hours a day commuting,
8 hour day sleeping,

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.010
and 8 hour a day working.

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:42.925
One third of his day is
spent in commutation by bus.

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:57.580
Of course, the system blew up.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:02.880
It blew up for a
number of reasons.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:08.125
It blew up because there
were some important figures

00:34:08.125 --> 00:34:08.625
involved.

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:15.840
It would not have occurred,
the new fifth city

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:20.760
would not have occurred,
had the ANC not--

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.820
there's a long story
behind all of this, which

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.320
I haven't got time to tell you.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:28.170
But one day, if
you're interested,

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:33.330
I'll tell you about Margaret
Thatcher's involvement

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:35.429
with South Africa liberalism.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:38.250
She just died this week.

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.409
She shouldn't be
venerated so much.

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:45.929
She was one of the few agents
who supported the South

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:48.210
African white government.

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:50.520
South Africa--
the United States,

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.400
of course, it
boycotted South Africa.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.690
And SANOC, the South African
National Olympic Committee

00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:01.020
had got South Africa kicked
out of the Olympic games.

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:05.350
In a sport-obsessed society,
such as South Africa,

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:10.590
it was as much rocked by
international punitive actions

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.860
against it taking part
in international sport.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:17.892
But Maggie Thatcher, in
the end, couldn't convince

00:35:17.892 --> 00:35:18.850
the rest of the world--

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:22.290
South Africa depends
on foreign investment.

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:26.190
And Maggie Thatcher
finally told Mr.--

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:30.390
whoever the white South African
prime minister was the time

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:34.770
that she couldn't any longer
support the ANC, the African

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:36.540
National--

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.110
forgive me.

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:39.120
It's a long story.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.260
Let's say South Africa changed.

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.730
And let's look at
Western Native Township

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:52.590
because we can learn something
from the environment of housing

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:56.750
by looking in detail at housing.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:59.530
There are 5,000--

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:04.140
2,000 houses of different
types with 80% of them

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.600
about 250 square feet.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:16.470
The house is about 20 feet by
20 feet in dimensions with an 8

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.675
by 12 porch.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:31.510
Over time, people changed
their houses, firstly,

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:33.310
enclosing the porch.

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:40.900
Well, firstly, in a very
tribal fashioned manner,

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:45.880
the first residents
who appeared in 1917

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:51.440
still had cows roaming
around the premises.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:57.010
The first act was to decorate
the front of their houses.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:59.020
The fronts of their
houses were always

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:03.070
decorated, never the
sides or the back.

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:06.140
The house didn't have
an internal toilet.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:11.340
The toilet was on the
back of the house.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.380
The first attempt to--

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:23.640
the houses were two rooms plus
a porch with a outfit for a coal

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.750
stove in the first room.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:33.600
The first inhabitants
reacted to their houses

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.990
the way they acted to
tribal circumstances.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:43.290
They used mud and [NON-ENGLISH]
decoration systems which you

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:48.190
scrape a pattern in the
mud and use cow dung to--

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:53.490
the house had no ceilings,
had no floors, had no gates.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:57.570
It was about the most
primitive, cheap item

00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:00.270
that the society could produce.

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:09.260
Over time, the enclosure
of the porch started.

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:13.640
It started by people
buying rubbish material

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:22.100
from Indian shops, old
ceiling tiles, thrown away

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:28.790
wood, some glass, and enclosed
the porches in this way.

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:33.320
You'll see them in
the photographs.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.700
This was dangerous.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.410
Fires broke out.

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:43.490
And the magistrate,
in his intelligence,

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:46.610
proclaimed that the
people who had enclosed

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:50.960
the porches innocent, saying
that under such density

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:54.260
you couldn't blame people
for making more space.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.770
He argued, however, that
the future decoration

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:02.420
and enclosures should be
more permanent and more safe.

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:06.470
From that time onwards,
the permanent decorations

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.180
took place.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:15.020
These decorations form
interesting for a number of--

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.460
you will see them.

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:20.480
I don't know if you've
seen them before.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.290
First of all, the
decorations are only

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:25.525
on the fronts of the houses.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:33.170
We only decorate the front
of our houses as well.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:38.780
There's no house in Newton
which has a decorated backyard.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.770
It has an antebellum facade.

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:50.640
Number two, the houses are
not free drawn decorations.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:54.980
There's a communal language
which is created in order to--

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:59.780
so everybody decorates according
to a communal language.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.740
The language consists
of rectangular systems,

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:11.750
circular systems, sun-dried
systems, and half-moon systems.

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:17.840
Most often refer ambiguously
to the past and the present.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:21.560
When I talked to a woman
about why she used a circle

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.500
on her house, she says to me--

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.750
and it's mainly the
women who decide

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:29.120
what the decorations are.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.060
She says to me,
look, you're smoking.

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:35.540
The ashtray you're
using is circular.

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:37.040
It's modern.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:41.330
Another woman says, when
you grow up in the country,

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:43.190
you live on a flat plane.

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:45.050
You see the sun rising.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:51.650
Therefore, a half-circle
decoration is the sun rising

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:54.650
or is the sun setting.

00:40:54.650 --> 00:41:02.270
So there's a syncretism
between rural and urban.

00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:06.170
It's almost as if the
decorative system manages

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:11.090
to nourish people both
in terms of the origins

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:17.330
and their past and the future
that they see in the city.

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:22.010
The city is allowing
them to migrate

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:26.900
as individuals and as a
society from a rural society

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.030
to an urban society.

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:31.400
Some of their houses,
as I will show you,

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:35.510
try to emulate white
middle-class houses.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:40.910
There's an expensive suburb of
Johannesburg called Houghton,

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:46.400
H-O-U-G-H-T-O-N. There's a
house called Hoyton in Western

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.890
H-O-Y-T-O-N.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:55.010
There's something miraculous
about a system of this kind,

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:58.890
a communally agreed upon system.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:02.420
This is where the first
self-help community

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:06.605
organizations occurred in
Black South African cities.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:15.320
Another interesting thing is
that you use abstract forms

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:18.570
to depict real situations.

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:24.830
So if the fafi game, which
is a Chinese gambling game,

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:30.290
is played intensively
in this environment--

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:33.290
there are 32 symbols.

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:36.122
I think 32 or 24.

00:42:36.122 --> 00:42:40.240
A woman who runs a
fafi saloon does--

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.000
I'll show you the image.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.740
There's a half-arch form on
the outside of her house.

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:53.750
If you look at it
carefully, she says to me,

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.670
you will see it's a horse.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:58.910
A horse was my lucky symbol.

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:03.200
It doesn't look
like a horse at all.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:09.230
The communist chairman of
the first ANC Transvaal group

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:17.060
puts a circle on this house with
a serrated edge to the circle.

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:19.460
When you ask him why
he first uses this,

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:22.070
he says, that's a
Stalinist image.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:23.615
It promotes industry.

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:27.640
There's a whole set--

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.320
I will show you two of them--

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:34.010
of decorations which are based
on the rectangular family which

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.920
become blades.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.090
Why blades?

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:41.410
Because razor blades
was, you know--

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:44.830
people were killed
regularly in this township.

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:48.280
There was a lot of violence,
a lot of gang warfare.

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.290
So blades become another form.

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:55.010
But a blade, what is
a razor blade made of?

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:56.680
It's made of three circles--

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.260
a primitive razor blade--

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.900
and a rectangular outline.

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:05.920
The genius of being able to
conform to a communal language

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:12.070
and yet express your
particular message

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:16.120
is what a city should be like.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:19.780
You should be able to promote
your individual experience,

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:23.650
but live within a
communal language.

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:27.010
At least that's the way I would
describe the formal attributes

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:28.900
of a good city.

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:30.130
Don't quote me on that.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.980
There are a lot of byproducts.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:44.720
Let me just mention one or
two for you to think about.

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:48.560
The notion of the popular--

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:52.340
the poetics of the
popular occur when

00:44:52.340 --> 00:45:00.060
you see African popular
art is extensive

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:05.130
and ranges all the way
from tombstones in Nigeria

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:11.880
to wall paintings to barbershop
advertisements and so on.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:18.210
The popular large margin
of freedom in people

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:22.590
to express themselves without
the classical requirements

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:26.650
of orthodoxy, it bends things.

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:28.230
It changes things.

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:33.270
Again, I refer you back to
the definition of classicism

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:37.090
in this paragraph I isolated.

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.840
Just before we look
at the slide images,

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:50.590
Let me see if I want to focus
your attention on anything

00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:51.090
else.

00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:01.350
The role of the popular
decoration is externalization--

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:05.010
the idea of the gaze, the
idea of the house looking out

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:05.700
on the street.

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.550
OK, I think this is--

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:22.740
when I first showed this
material in London many years

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:29.640
ago at the Institute of
Contemporary Art in London,

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:35.640
somebody in the audience
stood up and said,

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:43.230
was I sharing this work as if
these were drawings on ghetto

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:48.660
walls, would I make an
exhibition of Jewish markings

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:52.225
on Nazi war camps?

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:59.450
I had always seen this
and experienced this work

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:03.450
as optimistic, as
showing that people

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:09.050
under extreme deprivation still
have an image of responding

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:11.960
to the city through
educating themselves,

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:15.290
through externalizing
themselves,

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:19.370
through communalizing and so on.

00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:24.320
And it's curious
that the relationship

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:27.530
between deprivation
and resistance

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:35.900
should be seen as negative, but
I can understand the argument

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:36.650
as well.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:46.780
Does the popularization of
items done by poor people

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:52.600
and sold as tourist
goods enable or--

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.030
it helps them economically?

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:56.580
Does it improve their culture?

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.750
Who knows?

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:04.420
We can debate these issues.

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:10.000
I think the issue of
deprivation and resistance

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.600
has the fundamental
aspect of an iconography

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.115
of fascinating topics.

00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:20.800
I was surprised--
I didn't know how

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.080
to answer the
gentleman who asked--

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:26.020
who assaulted me in London.

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:28.330
I've never been assaulted since.

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:34.120
This material has been shared
widely as part of the BBC film.

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:41.190
And let's look at this stuff.

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:46.770
I think the marginal quality of
things in an urban environment

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:51.360
is the grease which
allows people often

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:55.290
to engage marginally
in an activity.

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:57.760
They cannot build
their own houses.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:02.640
They cannot select a house
under the Group Areas Act.

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:06.100
These people decorated
their houses every year,

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:09.210
despite the fact that
they were renters.

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:12.780
They assumed permanent
ownership despite being

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:17.620
renters because they
were there for 25 years.

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.100
They never assumed that
they would be moved out.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:27.950
So the notion of the popular,
the notion of a fluid system

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:32.750
which is generated in a city,
is an interesting idea to me.

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:38.180
Because the prismatic quality
of identifying separate items

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:43.250
in a city, the situationist's
view of the city,

00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:45.500
is interesting in that regard.

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.920
G. Debord's notion of
Paris as being made up

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:54.920
of fluid communities
and Towards Cosmopolis

00:49:54.920 --> 00:50:00.890
book of the other, the new
migrant environment in cities

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:04.400
of permanent migrations
is interesting,

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.695
but we'll touch on these
subjects a bit later.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.270
And let's look at
pictures instead.

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:12.830
It's much more refreshing.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.780
OK.

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:18.660
Turn off the lights.

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:36.510
The analysis on
the right indicates

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:38.730
the move towards the southwest.

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:45.050
The horizontal lines
are the public sector.

00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:49.800
In the early stages of the
city, the mining companies

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:54.060
provide housing in this
Sophiatown housing.

00:50:54.060 --> 00:51:03.630
As soon as the supply of Black
is too small for the market,

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:08.220
you have these white
dots, squatter settlements

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:12.390
take place at the beginning
of the apartheid city.

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:18.150
Because the demand, the supply
of white housing is, too.

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:22.740
And soon, the white housing
is completely-- at least

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:25.890
the market housing is
completely eliminated.

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:35.930
And Soweto, which is
these two black volumes,

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:38.420
creates a second city.

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:43.360
Next, this is the mining camp.

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:49.250
Here's the Kaffir location--

00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:53.060
there's no embarrassment
about using the word Kaffir--

00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:55.250
next to the Coolie occasion.

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:58.460
The Coolie location is
where the plague broke out

00:51:58.460 --> 00:51:59.930
and Gandhi intervened.

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:10.790
Here are the small blocks
of the white mining camp.

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:11.290
Next.

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:22.690
The third city, Soweto--

00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:24.115
an engineer's madness.

00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:33.520
All houses are built like huts.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:38.710
The notion that Blacks in
Harlem in the United States

00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:43.960
are crime ridden
and dense housing

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:47.680
produces criminal
behavior is sold

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:51.550
as part of the nationalist
government's orthodoxy.

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:58.010
You can see the
only public space

00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:02.460
are large tracts of green
space with a few isolated.

00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:04.970
There is no central
business area.

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:05.975
There are few schools.

00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:15.080
Whatever it looks like, it is.

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:15.580
Next.

00:53:22.584 --> 00:53:30.760
The building of Soweto
starts with Pimville in 1904.

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:35.260
The public supply
of Black housing

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:39.880
increases slowly, but
has incredible spike

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:43.970
with the advent of the
nationalist government in 1948.

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:49.540
So from this point onwards, the
whole governmental apparatus

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:51.730
both at the national
and at the city

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:58.330
level is oriented toward the
application of the Group Areas

00:53:58.330 --> 00:54:01.630
Act, the Pass Laws.

00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:06.430
The Johannesburg City
Council passed 96 acts

00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:10.990
dealing with the Black people
in each city in the few years

00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:17.085
of this second, third city.

00:54:17.085 --> 00:54:17.585
Next.

00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:26.350
The tallest building
in Africa, 52 floors,

00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:29.740
one of the tallest concrete
buildings in the world,

00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:33.280
was designed by Skidmore,
Owings, and Merrill

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.425
with separate toilets
for whites and Blacks.

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:43.000
So when I was visiting--

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.890
were invited by the students
to come and give a lecture,

00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:52.480
when they were asked by students
how they could design toilets

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.120
for whites and
Blacks separately,

00:54:55.120 --> 00:55:00.320
they were embarrassed
and said, well, you know,

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.650
you have to work where you--

00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:07.835
the gold mining dumps are
part of the landscape.

00:55:07.835 --> 00:55:08.335
Next.

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:13.540
The depiction of
the center of city,

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:17.830
this is the drawing
for Charles Center,

00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:23.060
all depicting white
people as the--

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:31.910
more and more, at the same
time, the everyday environment

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:34.005
was that of Black people.

00:55:34.005 --> 00:55:34.505
Next.

00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:42.040
Soweto produced,
amongst its horrors,

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:47.920
the use of a 19th
century fixed-line rail

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:51.540
system and a bus system
to take people to work.

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:53.185
Here's a line
waiting for a train.

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:58.780
Springs is a suburb
of Johannesburg.

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:01.360
"Whites only to springs."

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:04.930
It's a bit strange
to look at this.

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:08.950
If you grew up in South Africa,
this is what you grew up with.

00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:15.860
And it's amazing how
striking it seems now.

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:16.360
Next.

00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:29.980
1976, the famous shooting
of this young Black boy

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:37.660
by the police in this riot
against Bantu education,

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:43.040
one of the beginnings of the
collapse of the rational city.

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:43.540
Next.

00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:52.350
I just put in this diagram
of somebody's approximation

00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:54.240
of apartheid city.

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:57.130
And sector theory
of Homer Hoyt--

00:56:57.130 --> 00:57:03.060
which we referred to a couple
of months ago in this class.

00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:09.630
The theory of Hoyt referred to
the American city segregating

00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:17.050
itself out in terms of
sectors, sectors moving,

00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:20.940
in the case of Johannesburg,
in the opposite direction

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:22.320
as Blacks.

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.600
Blacks in the
industry always are

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.910
in the south or the southwest.

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:31.440
Whites always are in the
north, moving northwards.

00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:33.000
Next.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.750
These areas here, this is
this Ciskei and the Transkei.

00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:41.280
And this is the Ciskei
and the Transkei

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:44.720
and Zululand and Botswana.

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:50.030
And these are the Bantustans.

00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:59.180
Here is the notion of treating
a rural population as rural,

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:04.460
maintaining the
rurality, but arguing

00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:09.020
that industry should located
on the perimeter using

00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:10.580
this local population.

00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:18.500
This uses strange terms.

00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:25.010
Deconcentration points, what's
a deconcentration point?

00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:28.250
Industrial development
to deconcentration points

00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:34.730
in national states, I mean,
this is like Nazi language.

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:41.420
I mean, you know,
planning language.

00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:49.450
Excuse me for getting a little
sentimental about all of this.

00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:49.950
Next.

00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:54.100
Western Native Township--

00:58:56.970 --> 00:59:03.900
2,000 houses, different
types of houses, but largely

00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:06.780
250 square feet.

00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:10.210
I'll just point out to you
a couple of other things.

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:15.450
These black lines
running horizontally,

00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:18.780
what this community
spontaneously does,

00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:27.020
if the block size is too large,
the house becomes a passageway.

00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:27.960
There are rituals.

00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:29.580
You knock on the door.

00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:30.720
You pass through.

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.770
And you say hello to
the woman of the house,

00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:34.520
and you walk out to
the back of the house.

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.140
There are a number of
community institutions.

00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:44.700
There are shebeens, which
are illegal drinking--

00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:48.360
alcohol is barred
to Black people

00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:50.250
entirely under apartheid.

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:52.890
You could only
drink kaffir beer,

00:59:52.890 --> 00:59:55.555
which was sold by the
government to get great profit.

00:59:58.650 --> 01:00:01.410
A stokvels is an ongoing party.

01:00:04.806 --> 01:00:08.360
There are all of these
self-help institutions,

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:13.070
which are part of the popular
culture place of this kind.

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:17.250
Next.

01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:26.000
Here is the house as
provided to the people.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:26.500
Next.

01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:38.660
A number of types of
house, it's a bit wrong.

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:42.650
Almost 80% of the
houses were type B

01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:47.720
without the additional
dotted area at the top.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:55.490
Type B is this plus that
if your porch is enclosed.

01:00:55.490 --> 01:01:03.440
It's 250 plus 100.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:10.330
This is analysis of
the walls of the house.

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:16.880
These solid black
indicates that the porch

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:21.280
is enclosed and decorated.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.672
The hollow circles
are where the porch

01:01:23.672 --> 01:01:26.380
is enclosed, but not decorated.

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:31.400
The empty lots are
nothing has happened.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.150
You can see the
intensity of decoration

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:37.480
is larger in this
area of the township,

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:43.970
large close to the outside
and entrance to the area

01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:46.780
and, also, because some of
the prominent families lived

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.720
in this area.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.220
Next.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.320
That's just what I've
tried to explain.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.290
This is the density
of decoration.

01:01:57.290 --> 01:02:02.090
And this is the breakdown
of facing street

01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:04.250
in terms of tribe.

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:06.980
I think yellow is Tswana.

01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:08.030
Blue is Zulu.

01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:11.390
And three is Tsonga.

01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:15.680
And four, I think, is Xhosa.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.930
Five is Ndebele and so on.

01:02:23.415 --> 01:02:23.915
Next.

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:32.410
The result is that
the street is made up

01:02:32.410 --> 01:02:38.740
of a consistent
iconography, circles,

01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:42.415
sun systems, and
other sun systems,

01:02:42.415 --> 01:02:44.290
a half-arch plus circles.

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:49.610
This is an undecorated house.

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:59.030
In addition to changing
the face of the house,

01:02:59.030 --> 01:03:12.730
the external environment of
the fences, the mail delivery

01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:21.670
options, gates, trees
are added to the city.

01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:22.170
Next.

01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:31.330
Here is the original
response on the left,

01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:36.040
mud and using a
fork or your fingers

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.010
to make traditional decoration.

01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:41.650
On the second is
the second attempt

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:45.390
to enclose the porch
using throwaway material.

01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:47.380
Next.

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:55.140
You can see everything
is taken into account

01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:59.760
from the mail delivery
point through to floor

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:07.530
polish zone, a garden,
two half-gardens.

01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:09.810
The porch is not
enclosed in this case,

01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:12.900
but is made into
an outdoor room.

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:18.840
The major wall is
decorated by a rising sun.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:23.130
You can see the
architectural ideas,

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:26.445
which would make an architect
like Louis Kahn proud.

01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:34.830
Here is an example of
a sun system embracing

01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:35.910
the whole of the thing.

01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:37.950
The porch is enclosed.

01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:41.220
There's a little--
one of the problems

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:47.236
was that this porch was always
asymmetrical in a facade.

01:04:47.236 --> 01:04:51.345
Here is a permanently parked
automobile as an external room.

01:04:54.230 --> 01:05:01.280
An interesting idea, you could
actually use an automobile

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:04.250
as a living room.

01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:06.230
I think a Lexus
automobile attempts

01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:09.170
to be a living room,
but a mobile one.

01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:12.470
I think it would be interesting
in if we ever got to the state

01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:16.980
where we are to regard
Lexus as permanent.

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:17.480
Next.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:27.190
Two other examples-- here's
a razor blade phenomenon.

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:28.790
AUDIENCE: Which one's
the razor blade?

01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:29.940
JULIAN BEINART: The green.

01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:30.300
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:30.800
I see.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:31.300
Yeah.

01:05:33.913 --> 01:05:35.580
JULIAN BEINART: There's
a version of it,

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:39.530
a more abstracted version, and
the more literal version of it

01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:46.630
there on top of which is a gable
and a classical attempt to--

01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:51.090
the sunrise of the gate.

01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:54.080
There's sunrise gates
all over the world.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:56.550
I know with the sunrise--

01:05:56.550 --> 01:06:01.010
I suppose, if you're
interested in heliocentricity.

01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:03.540
When I once showed
this material,

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:06.830
a man who was an
Egyptian heliocentrist

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:13.890
said that this was all a
subliminal sun devotion system.

01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:15.135
I don't understand that.

01:06:15.135 --> 01:06:15.635
Next.

01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:20.605
Here are rectangular forms.

01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:35.150
You find this in Florence in
decorative wooden wall systems.

01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:37.880
The old idea in
heliocentricity is

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:41.900
that this is a skin
which is pinned down

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:48.320
in the four corners, allowing
these quarter circle set backs.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.490
The architectural
problem was often

01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:59.545
dealing with the asymmetry
between the two sides.

01:06:59.545 --> 01:07:00.045
Next.

01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:09.920
Here the large
form of the facade

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.810
is reproduced in the mailboxes.

01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:19.190
On the other side
is a combination

01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:23.070
of the rectangular system
with a circular system.

01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:23.570
Next.

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:33.925
Difference in material--
this is all cheap concrete.

01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:41.100
The two circles-- next.

01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:52.720
The use of the color of the back
wall of the main facade wall

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:57.040
and the floating of a
rectangular texture on it

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:01.480
leaving the four circles in
the background is predominant.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:01.980
Next.

01:08:04.810 --> 01:08:07.480
Here's the razor blade.

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:13.900
Three circles, four empty
circles and a rectangle

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:17.500
constitutes a razor blade.

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.828
On the right-hand side
is another version

01:08:19.828 --> 01:08:20.620
of the razor blade.

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:22.790
We saw in the drawing.

01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:23.290
Next.

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:32.399
The fafi saloon lady elephant
on the-- or horse I think it

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:40.040
is on the right And the
communist industrial rotor

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:44.580
for the ANC leader on the right.

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:47.863
AUDIENCE: There are some colors
that keep repeating themselves,

01:08:47.863 --> 01:08:50.210
like this light blue--

01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:51.168
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

01:08:51.168 --> 01:08:53.210
AUDIENCE: --kind of
pistachio even and this light

01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:53.835
terracotta--

01:08:53.835 --> 01:08:54.710
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

01:08:54.710 --> 01:08:56.627
AUDIENCE: --is there a
preference in the color

01:08:56.627 --> 01:08:58.910
that they use?

01:08:58.910 --> 01:09:00.740
JULIAN BEINART: No,
not that I can answer.

01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:04.430
The trouble was that,
during the period

01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:08.960
that we studied
this community, I

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:12.170
got to know this community
through the Jazz movement,

01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:17.779
by taking Black
musicians home at night.

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:22.220
And one night, the lights
shone on these walls.

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:25.250
And I said, my god, something
strange is happening here.

01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:26.509
I never been here.

01:09:26.509 --> 01:09:28.550
Whites don't go to
Black townships,

01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:32.715
not at that time in
South Africa's history.

01:09:32.715 --> 01:09:36.590
It was too dangerous.

01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:40.189
So by the time I
got involved in this

01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:44.960
was in protests which was
starting against the removal

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.660
of Blacks from Sophiatown.

01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:52.439
So the demolition of Sophiatown
caused enormous Black anger.

01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:56.260
And I was one of the
people who was there

01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:59.645
as a supposedly urbanist.

01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:08.720
And I came back to
Western Native Township

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:12.050
when the people were
starting to be moved out.

01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:15.470
And colored people
were being moved in

01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:20.940
to replace the Black
people as temporary houses.

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:26.330
Some of the color system is
over painted by colored people

01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:30.290
on top of the Black people.

01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:33.230
I have no record of
what this thing looked

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:35.150
like 10 years before.

01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:36.920
Nobody has.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:42.290
This is the only
record that exists.

01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:44.420
So I would have to guess.

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:47.180
I think the colors would
be more restrained.

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:50.690
I think the color
over painting--

01:10:50.690 --> 01:10:53.900
you'd see pink and
bright colors--

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:57.600
is probably not the
colors that we used.

01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:58.100
Next.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:04.900
This is an example of
the problem of symmetry.

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:09.010
This is the halfway
line in the facade

01:11:09.010 --> 01:11:13.180
and this incredible
architectural move

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:20.590
of marking the center of
the facade by a color shift

01:11:20.590 --> 01:11:28.450
and still then using these
identical forms on either side.

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:31.180
Next.

01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:34.540
The half-circle-- again
explained consistently

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:37.280
as the sunrise or sunset.

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:37.780
Next.

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:43.170
The sun itself takes many forms.

01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:46.390
Next.

01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:55.410
That pink is a colored
painting, over-painting.

01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:01.680
One could do a study of the
colored temporary migration

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:02.520
before.

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:05.110
This township doesn't
exist anymore.

01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:06.440
It's gone.

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:15.440
The coloreds who moved in
is a temporary phenomenon.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:19.860
AUDIENCE: So each inhabitant
of the house usually

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:21.900
would design
completely their own?

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:24.610
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah, yeah.

01:12:24.610 --> 01:12:28.460
Yeah, generally, the
woman in the house.

01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:29.335
AUDIENCE: I see that.

01:12:29.335 --> 01:12:31.270
JULIAN BEINART: The
husband was either

01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:35.470
too busy drinking
or earning a living

01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:39.220
or being a member of
a gang or whatever.

01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:41.852
The women in this--

01:12:41.852 --> 01:12:44.275
this is a very
matrilineal society.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.290
The people I spoke
to who seemed to know

01:12:53.290 --> 01:12:56.350
most about the decoration
of the houses were women.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:14.290
And often, if I asked why did
you choose the sun system,

01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:18.290
the answer would be the
sun represents hope.

01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:22.580
Or where I grew
up in the country,

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:26.270
I saw the sunrise every morning.

01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:29.630
You know, what do you
expect people to say?

01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:38.230
If I were to ask you why you
have a painting in your house,

01:13:38.230 --> 01:13:42.775
you say, I like Piero della
Francesca, or I prefer Uccello.

01:13:42.775 --> 01:13:46.930
Or I happen to have a Picasso
because my mother gave it

01:13:46.930 --> 01:13:49.810
to me when I was a child.

01:13:49.810 --> 01:13:54.625
Does somebody, say, give you
analysis of Picasso's painting?

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:02.775
Why do you expect these people
to know more about the way?

01:14:02.775 --> 01:14:03.275
Next.

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:11.810
Two houses nearby-- these are
white middle class houses,

01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:14.730
low white income, middle houses.

01:14:14.730 --> 01:14:19.760
They are often referred to
as models for these people

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:24.590
to look at as a symbol
of improvement--

01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:28.130
next-- whereas they
come from an environment

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:29.470
in their own countryside.

01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:37.040
This is a Ndebele decoration
on the left and Zulu decoration

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.405
on the right.

01:14:38.405 --> 01:14:40.280
Could you just turn on
the light at the back?

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:43.790
AUDIENCE: The last one is a
book of all this research?

01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:45.190
JULIAN BEINART: Sorry.

01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:48.510
AUDIENCE: The last slide
was a book of this research?

01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:50.300
JULIAN BEINART: No,
it was published.

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.850
It's been published extensively.

01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:55.250
I never wrote a book
because I'm too lazy--

01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:56.330
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:56.330 --> 01:14:58.310
--to write books.

01:14:58.310 --> 01:15:01.580
I write long articles
instead of books.

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:02.982
Books are--

01:15:02.982 --> 01:15:05.780
AUDIENCE: Was that normal?

01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:09.296
JULIAN BEINART: It was
in Edilizia Moderna,

01:15:09.296 --> 01:15:12.065
a special issue on
Africa, which I edited.

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.930
This appears in a number
of different forms.

01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:22.130
The piece, which I gave you
in the required reading,

01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:25.490
is good enough.

01:15:25.490 --> 01:15:29.570
And it's got enough of
what I've said today in it.

01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:32.120
It's an endless story.

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:35.030
I mean, what interests
me more is your reaction

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:38.145
to this material than
the material itself.

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:47.000
I mean can you enlarge
on this phenomenon

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.700
where does it make you
think of In Soweto, people

01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:57.560
don't decorate the external
public facades anymore.

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.090
They become like all of you.

01:15:59.090 --> 01:16:03.950
They buy expensive overstuffed
furniture and the television

01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:05.480
set.

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:10.820
They've interiorized the
environment as we have.

01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:15.230
Nobody in Manhattan cares
about the public facade

01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:19.490
of the apartment block except
for the way you enter it.

01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:25.370
You've got to have a canopy
and a man dressed up in uniform

01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:28.460
for it to be expensive.

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:31.990
So we all have notions of
explicating our status.

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:41.300
If we were in a tribe,
in an urban tribe,

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:45.950
in a ghetto and had some
way of wanting to improve

01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:47.540
our conditions, there's--

01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:50.120
remember, there were seven
people in these two rooms.

01:16:55.230 --> 01:17:02.140
And sometimes there were
additional items as well of

01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:02.770
space.

01:17:02.770 --> 01:17:09.340
But 80% of the houses
had about two rooms.

01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:13.120
I think it's a very positive
enlarging phenomenon

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:16.090
that people have the capacity--

01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:19.840
we regard children as having
the capacity to demonstrate

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:23.350
something unique when
they do drawings.

01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:28.360
That capacity is lost
as we become adults.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:32.500
You could say these
people are naive.

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.750
They are primitive.

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:39.580
They still have the
courage or whatever

01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:44.050
it is to do something naive
in front of their house.

01:17:44.050 --> 01:17:45.295
To them, it wasn't naive.

01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:51.000
But it raises the
issue of the popular

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.160
in the urban phenomenon.

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:56.010
And it's, I think,
an extraordinarily

01:17:56.010 --> 01:18:00.150
interesting and
important concept.

01:18:00.150 --> 01:18:04.960
Why this received such
publicity when it was published

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:10.560
and I was giving lectures
all over the place

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:15.630
was because people like
John Turner here at MIT,

01:18:15.630 --> 01:18:19.770
[? Jonah Brockin ?] in
Hartland before he came to MIT,

01:18:19.770 --> 01:18:24.970
were talking about
changeable structures.

01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:34.220
[? Jonah Brockin ?] book
says that indwelling

01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:37.370
is a creative
phenomenon, that we only

01:18:37.370 --> 01:18:39.230
need to build supports
for people who

01:18:39.230 --> 01:18:42.170
can finish products themselves.

01:18:42.170 --> 01:18:46.280
Individuation, expression
of individual identity,

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:52.450
all of these meaningful
items in urbanism

01:18:52.450 --> 01:18:57.170
are what this raises for me.

01:18:57.170 --> 01:19:00.480
South Africa is an extreme case.

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:03.530
If this were class
in pathology, it

01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:09.485
would be like showing a case
of a dying cancer patient.

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.220
Look at the extreme.

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:21.790
There is no more extreme
public doctrine of racialism

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:24.010
as in South Africa.

01:19:24.010 --> 01:19:27.070
And this is the response.

01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:30.310
This is one of the responses.

01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:37.400
Hundreds of thousands of people
died in that regime as well.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:49.990
But I don't know.

01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:54.340
What I can suggest is that you
think about this phenomenon

01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:58.540
and transported into your own
understanding of the cities

01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:01.840
that you live in and deal
with and make plans for.

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:07.610
If only everybody in the
world had the capacity

01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:11.150
to react in this
positive way to--

01:20:11.150 --> 01:20:14.110
our cities would look different.
