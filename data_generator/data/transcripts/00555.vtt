00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.390
JULIAN BEINART: I've
handed out a guide

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.130
to what we're going
to cover today.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.080
Now, I don't know how familiar
you are with the material.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.230
Does anybody, for instance,
have any familiarity

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.430
with what is called
space syntax?

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.190
How much familiarity?

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.280
STUDENT: I saw a
presentation that someone

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.570
who is working in
England on space syntax

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.400
gave to the National Capital
Park and Planning Commission

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.547
in DC.

00:01:00.547 --> 00:01:01.380
JULIAN BEINART: And?

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.003
STUDENT: It was
pretty interesting.

00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:05.670
JULIAN BEINART: When
was this, recently?

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.170
Or--

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.160
STUDENT: Yeah, 2011 I think.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.200
JULIAN BEINART: Do the
book Space is a Machine?

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.700
STUDENT: No.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.070
Is that what the
reading was from?

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.750
JULIAN BEINART: No, this
is a voluminous document.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.712
It costs a lot of money to buy.

00:01:23.712 --> 00:01:24.838
STUDENT: [LAUGHS]

00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:25.630
JULIAN BEINART: Ah.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.220
It really is more of an
expansion of the space syntax

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.340
methodology and the idea than
we have time for in this class.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.360
That's why I ask if anybody
is familiar with it.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.670
OK.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.025
This is the last class
in the first section.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.990
And we're concentrated
again, very, very briefly,

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.610
as we did on Tuesday,
with theories

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.200
which seem to be determined by
the logic from social science.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.570
There are microtheories
within each

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.970
of these, lots of rules of
thumb, lots of understanding

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.440
which is not externalized
theoretically.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.050
For instance, one
of my favorites

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:52.430
is Fifth Avenue and Park Avenue.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:16.120
A section through a building
on Fifth Avenue, a section

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.530
of a building on Park Avenue.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.920
On Fifth Avenue, the
ground is significant.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.610
Everything that is
built is connected

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.070
to the ground by
mechanical systems,

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.385
generally an escalator
for five or six floors.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.410
The basement is
important because it's

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.425
linked to a surface only
one floor from the ground.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.050
Two buildings on Park
Avenue which you know,

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.670
Lever Brothers and
Seagram's building.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:26.256
Lever Brothers gives up
the ground for nothing.

00:04:26.256 --> 00:04:27.970
The ground is worthless.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.440
Seagram's building
extends a plaza,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.895
in return for which it gets
more bulk to build taller.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.620
The role of the ground
in these two cases

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.970
are the subject of an
economic theory, which

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.520
is just the rule of thumb.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.470
It's observed.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.470
I don't know of a rule of--

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:10.110
it's much like, well, other
rules of thumb in our business.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.520
In fact, it's curious.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.680
In a discipline such
as architecture,

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.620
there are very few
theoretical texts.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.495
There used to be
theoretical texts.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.710
How do you learn architecture?

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.710
Have you got a textbook?

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.700
You can't learn science
without a textbook.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.270
A textbook is the agreed-upon
synthesized material

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.520
which you need to know.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.710
I make this preface because some
of the theoretical propositions

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.410
we will look at today suffer
from the same difficulty.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:12.020
But they, unlike the series
which we looked at on Tuesday,

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.640
where space was either
neutral, or costly,

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.570
or friction-producing, or
a measure for recording

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.350
a distribution of some process--

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.450
most of what we feel to be true
and experience with the city

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.185
is lost.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.840
None of the social
science theories--

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.560
with the exception,
perhaps, of the first one,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.510
which we discussed--

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.530
has any connection to
valuing the built environment

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.580
as something in itself.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.830
Kevin Lynch is the first of the
protagonists of a theory which

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:00.380
deals with equality of
the built environment

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.960
en masse, not a single building,
but a system of buildings.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.525
Lynch starts his work--

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:21.050
there's an of Lynch's work at
MIT just down the corridor.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.890
If you have time one day and
you have nothing else to do,

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:30.950
look at his notebook on
his first visit to Italy

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:35.630
when he was a young
professor here at MIT.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:39.770
He does a detailed drawing
of the path system linking

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:45.890
the major squares and piazza,
the piazza and churches,

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.620
beautifully drawn.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.860
At the end of his four
or five days in Florence,

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.390
he writes a note.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.610
Why did I not ask
the people what

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.740
they do on Saturday nights?

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.390
What about the
activity in this town?

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.280
Why don't I take
that into account?

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.120
Then he leaves Florence.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:20.360
His preoccupation with trying to
understand the spatial pattern

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:26.030
of cities through
asking people is

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:31.340
evident in his first book,
The Image of the City.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.039
What is the image of the city?

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.010
The image of the city is
made up of three items.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.169
What are the three?

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:42.160
You've read the book, I presume.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.698
What are the three?

00:08:44.698 --> 00:08:46.240
STUDENT: There's
the experiment where

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.070
they ask people on the street.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.778
JULIAN BEINART: Yes,
and I didn't ask you

00:08:49.778 --> 00:08:53.240
for ho the study was done.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:59.090
I asked you, what are the
three abstract components?

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:04.430
I'll tell you-- identity,
structure, and meaning.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.520
That equals image.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.430
And you find this out
by cognitive mapping,

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.420
by asking people how they
find their way around cities--

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.590
Los Angeles, New York,
Boston, and so on.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.765
What Lynch could not do in that
study was deal with meaning.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:35.540
It's significant that the power
that The Image of the City book

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:41.750
had escapes the one
component which bedevils us

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:45.293
in our valuation of much
of the built environment,

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:46.085
and that's meaning.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.460
Kevin apologized twice
in different publications

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.430
for his inability to
deal with meaning.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:06.930
I say that as a beginning
to a discussion of his work.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:15.880
When, in this class,
we asked people,

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:21.010
when he was teaching here
with me, what they remembered

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:27.450
of the book, they would
say landmarks, Z, Z, Z,

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.430
a set of alphabetical items.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.570
And then says, that's not
what I wrote the book for.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.520
I wrote the book
to make it clear

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.080
that if you want to know
something about a city,

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.360
you have to ask the
people who live in it,

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:49.240
not take formulaic
generalizations.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.570
Of course, he was being
a bit harsh on himself.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:59.470
But his last book--

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.065
I must say, one of the
things about all the theories

00:11:02.065 --> 00:11:05.170
that I'll be discussing
today is that they've

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.590
published the ideas.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.010
They're not hermeneutic.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:12.740
They're not hermetic.

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.940
They're not sealed
off from examination.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:28.020
In architecture, so much of
knowledge is internalized.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.910
Your sensibility to
patterns is built up

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:39.530
through much of the
practice of priesthood.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.230
Lynch and the others today--

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.500
by the way, the others
today will be in order--

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:59.280
Kevin Lynch, Christopher
Alexander, John Habraken,

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.170
space syntax.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:07.170
And then last, we'll look at
the work of the British Land Use

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.910
and Built Form group in
Cambridge, England, Lionel

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:12.450
March.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.430
Sir Lionel March.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.830
Oh, no, and he wasn't knighted.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.525
Sorry just Lionel March.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.950
For Lynch, the
problem remains that--

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.350
let me see if I
can find a phrase.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.160
No, there isn't one
phrase that I can

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.380
find which sums up his search.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:56.750
What I'll do with him is
go through the performance

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:07.310
of dimension theory, which is
the last one, which he built up

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:11.750
in this class and which is
published in a book which

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.700
was called A Theory
of Good City Form

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:21.300
and then appeared late as Good
City Form, and use that as--

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:26.660
and then I will compare
that with his writings

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:32.210
on a utopian speculation
that he made, just to give

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.790
some embodiment to his ideas.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:48.830
Some generalizations--
unlike Christopher Alexander

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:52.580
and John Habraken, Lynch's
work is not a critique

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.945
of contemporary urbanism.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:10.985
His philosophy is in relation
to present-day city and time.

00:14:10.985 --> 00:14:17.610
He is completely interested in
the complexity and difficulty

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:24.130
we have understanding
of the form of a city.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:32.292
He believes there are ranges of
understanding, not standards.

00:14:32.292 --> 00:14:34.690
His theory,
performance dimension,

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:38.980
set up ranges within which
different cultures could

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:46.060
construct their own standards
and which the dimensions could

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:50.890
be compared one to
another and then balanced

00:14:50.890 --> 00:15:00.910
again two meta-criteria,
justice and application.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:30.960
Lynch's humanism comes
from his appreciation

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.820
of one of the major dimensions
of the human system,

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.620
and that's its
capacity to learn.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:56.600
And therefore, his
ideal utopia is

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:02.420
a manifestation of
human beings' ability

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.180
to change culture
and aspirations

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.620
rather than the manifestation
of some iron law.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:13.880
There's no drawing
in his utopia.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.730
It's partly because
of his decision

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:24.440
that architecture
doesn't help much

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.980
in understanding urban form.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:34.520
I recall a disagreement I
had in this class with him

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.540
when I introduced Aldo
Rossi's book, which

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.880
was new at the time.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.710
And Lynch was very angry.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:52.220
And he writes about the
denouncement of Aldo Rossi.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.850
I tried to argue that there
was some merit in Rossi's

00:16:55.850 --> 00:17:02.600
speculation as an
architect and so on.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:08.440
I don't understand why Lynch
disparaged architecture

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.099
as such.

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:13.579
He didn't disparage
architecture as a discipline.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:16.940
He disparaged the method
in which architects

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:21.740
took upon themselves
the right to invent

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.490
spatial ideas on their own--

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.630
again, without consultation.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:37.840
Lynch was so aghast at the
idea of an imperial rulership

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:43.230
of knowledge and
hesitated every time

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:49.680
to embrace something unless
it had been acknowledged

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.000
by human experience.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.520
Many of these people whose
theories I talking about today

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:05.700
are very much rooted in
observing existing patterns

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.900
and building on them.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:12.110
They differ in
respect to the way

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:15.650
in which they observe
these patterns, what

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.570
they make of them.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:21.380
I will show you that in
Christopher Alexander's pattern

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:28.160
language, he makes
absolutely derivations

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.330
from his observation
of human behavior.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:37.760
John Habraken never makes
a categorical, good or bad.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.340
John Habraken believes
that all agreements

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:45.410
are good because they are
saturated with information

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.610
from culture and so on.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:58.690
Lynch wishes to build
a model for the world

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:07.390
as if urbanism was at the
beginning of its trajectory.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:12.310
He believes that, in
the model of science,

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:17.005
that science started
from nowhere.

00:19:17.005 --> 00:19:21.100
It kept on repeating
experiments, developing

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.940
new and new identity,
and new and new ideology,

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:32.170
and reaching a point where it
was much more sophisticated

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:35.440
than where it began.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:40.030
So he starts off by
setting out the dimensions

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.380
that you had to take.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:45.850
This is Kepler looking
at this, trying

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:51.740
to derive a theory of
the Earth's movement.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.630
Lynch is trying to set forth,
what are the things that you

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:59.290
have to take into
account and measure

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:03.820
in order to have a
comprehensive view of a city

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:07.030
independent of which
place in the world it is,

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.420
independent of which culture?

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:25.800
He experiments
with these and has

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:39.190
a set of ideas which he
writes about which set up

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:46.930
the prologue to these ideas.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:52.240
I gave you, in the handout
today, one of these subideas.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.300
It was the notion
of adaptability.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.450
Again, adaptability
would interest Lynch

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:02.440
because it is the capacity
of the human being

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.460
to change patterns
after learning.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:13.570
Adaptability in our class
discussion was a separate item.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:19.060
It became, in the book,
a subset of the item fit.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:24.610
I gave you this
piece on adaptability

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:30.760
as an example of how he
would ask you to develop it.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:37.000
He said-- let me find an example
of what I gave to you today.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.520
He tries to break
down adaptability

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.900
into subcategories.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:59.490
Manipulability, which is
different from reversibility.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:00.750
What is resilience?

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.510
What is the innovativeness?

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:09.630
I then added-- in
your thing, I've

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:15.120
given you some handwritten
response from Lynch,

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:22.140
not because that you should
read it, but here is an idea.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:26.066
He writes this piece
on adaptability.

00:22:26.066 --> 00:22:28.800
See, it's circulated.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:37.140
Somebody, an economist, sends
back a review of his ideas.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:41.290
And then he replies
to the economist.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:45.990
This is a handwritten
reply to a colleague.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:51.870
His imagination is that if
we each, all the students

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:56.910
of urbanism, took on
the task of identifying

00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:02.430
in specific terms what these
categories of inevitability,

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:09.960
we would have a basis for
a specific culture settling

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:15.105
an item of reversibility
in specific terms.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.670
Standards would imply
that all of them

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.260
are equal for all cultures.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.090
Of course, that's not true.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:27.240
You could have
varying standards.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:33.900
But for Lynch, the idea was that
we were in such a rough state,

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:41.370
theoretically, that you had
to set out these items more

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:42.510
systematically.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:48.640
He didn't get very far.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.850
He died too young.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:55.660
And if he were here
today, he'd add

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.375
more than I'm able to
explain on his behalf.

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:06.250
In his collected works,
there's a chapter

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.070
called "A Place, Utopia".

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:12.490
Now, it's interesting
that this place, utopia,

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:16.510
which is his speculation about
what an ideal urban world would

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:17.353
look like--

00:24:17.353 --> 00:24:18.145
there's no drawing.

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:26.450
In The Image of the City,
he uses little drawings

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:33.720
on the side of the text to
add information visually.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.030
Here, there's no drawing.

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:42.990
I'll just pick out a couple of
items from "The Place, Utopia".

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:46.260
Has anybody read
"A Place, Utopia"?

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:49.380
We're not wasting my
time, then, or your time.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:10.150
I propose, he says, to leave--

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:13.110
I attempt something more
modest here without losing

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:15.180
track of society.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:19.990
I propose to leave it
unaccounted for except where

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:24.750
it springs from some
feature of place.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:31.500
Everything about what I'm
going to say, he says,

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.280
is about how people relate
to their surroundings,

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:40.350
rather than out of a
self-absorbed technical fantasy

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:43.650
or mechanical consequence
of social prescription

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:44.850
on the other.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:48.270
In other words, what he's saying
is that there are items which

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:51.250
we can learn from
simply from the way

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:56.490
space is used and manipulated.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:00.250
Imagine an urban countryside,
a highly varied but humanized

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:00.750
landscape.

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:04.980
It is neither urban nor rural
in the old sense since houses,

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:09.660
workplaces are set among
trees, farms, and streams.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.960
Within this extensive
countryside,

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.500
there's a network of small,
intensive urban centers.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.450
The countryside
is as functionally

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:22.320
intricate and interdependent
as any contemporary city.

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:36.090
The land, the space is
not allocated to owners.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:43.980
The use of land is brief
in the history of cities,

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:50.370
so much like we've picked
up from other sources.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:54.255
It is better for the land to
be in the hands of a trust.

00:26:54.255 --> 00:26:58.740
He calls them a
regional land trust.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.895
These tasks grant leases for
the present enjoyment of space.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:15.120
Everyone is trained to read
a place just as everyone

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.360
is trained to read a good book.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.735
There are slow places
and fast places.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.190
I can go through
this in some detail.

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.880
But you can read it yourself.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:37.930
What is significant about it is
that he doesn't start off with

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:43.660
a definition that a city
is anything that cannot be

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:50.680
replicated through a mixture
of landscape and building.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.280
He doesn't depict the building.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.180
He sees, in a trained
society, people

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.240
will pick good buildings.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.780
They will make them
from good materials.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:08.440
His emphasis is on depicting
those spaces in buildings

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.950
or infrastructure of
a city which derive

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:15.370
from the goodness of people.

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:22.040
Now, people are not good.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.950
They're good and bad.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:26.020
Sometimes they are both.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:29.320
We are all good and
bad in our life.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:33.220
There's an element in many of
these theorists in depicting

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:37.720
a society without
political friction,

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.240
without individual competition.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:45.670
John Habraken's agreements--
he says good agreements

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.800
will be made independent
of whether you're

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.990
a Marxist or Capitalist.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:53.695
You will have to come to some
agreement about where you enter

00:28:53.695 --> 00:28:57.730
a building, whether there
is parking underground,

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:02.125
or how many floors of building
there are above ground.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:12.060
Christopher Alexander also
bypasses the political impact

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.360
on his work.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.370
He makes decisions
about patterns

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:21.150
which are not subject
to intercourse

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:23.850
for producing agreements.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:29.520
These patterns are decided
upon through his examination

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.530
of the nature of order.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.340
Alexander has an interesting
trajectory in his work.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:47.720
His first book, Notes
on the Synthesis of--

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.260
I don't know if any of you
have paid particular attention

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.570
to Alexander's work.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:58.460
Has anybody been an
Alexander student?

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.710
No.

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:06.410
Christopher Alexander,
when I first ran into him

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:08.510
was at Harvard.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:15.140
And he had written Notes on
the Synthesis of Form, which

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:18.665
was an admiration and an
attempt to understand how

00:30:18.665 --> 00:30:22.400
a culture, such as that
in the Middle East,

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:27.410
could make carpets without
any explicit instruction

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:33.980
as to how to do them, only an
oral tradition, handed down,

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:38.390
but allowing within that
tradition enormous variation

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:39.950
in the maintenance of quality.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:51.750
He looked to computation
to enable us to,

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.820
perhaps, do the
same kind of thing.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:31:01.170
Let's maintain quality,
although explicitly unclear

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:02.760
about how we were doing it.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:13.630
He's moved through a number
of phases in his work.

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:14.665
No sooner did he--

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:26.560
been interested in
optimization, then he

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:32.510
wrote a piece about how
to maximize communication,

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:36.970
a silly piece in which he
argues that in the zoning

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:43.480
of suburban housing, the
living room should be exposed

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:50.800
to the street and curtains would
be unnecessary, that people

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:55.330
would enjoy partaking in
the experience of being

00:31:55.330 --> 00:32:01.810
a community, a remark which
might well apply to New York

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:05.260
City but not to an
American suburb.

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:08.030
He then published a
significant paper called--

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:15.200
"The Structure of a
City is Not a Tree."

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.340
It was more complicated
than a tree,

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:22.980
didn't have a central
trunk with all its branches

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.960
regularly sprouting
from the trunk.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.550
But geometrically, he
couldn't explain what it was.

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:33.570
But he knew it wasn't a tree.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:39.870
And then-- partly, I think,
because of his living

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:46.380
on the west coast
[CHUCKLES] where, perhaps,

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:52.700
the counterculture has spread
more ideas in American thought

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.800
than anywhere else
in the world--

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:04.530
he started arguing that
there was a microunit which

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:07.800
had spatial and social
characteristics, what

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.690
he calls patterns.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:15.720
Each microunit has a pattern.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.150
There are good patterns,
and there are bad patterns.

00:33:24.581 --> 00:33:29.990
He studies a field of
spatial and social relations.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:32.695
There are good, living
patterns; bad, dead ones.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:42.230
We do not need grand planning
or design for the whole town

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:45.350
if each thing is made
in a context which

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:47.270
the other understands.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:51.425
The town emerges by itself
and is continually repaired.

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:05.010
He believes that society has--

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.340
it's a romantic notion--

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.940
has a history of patterns
which are good patterns.

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:14.030
They're good patterns
because they're lived in,

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:15.920
they're understood.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:19.520
Like Patrick Geddes, he tries--

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:26.580
remember, Patrick Geddes
is the plane diagram

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:34.199
which emotional, objective,
experienced items all

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:36.980
can fold into each other.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:45.480
Here, Alexander is very much
again trying to link feeling

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.650
and thought.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:57.030
A good pattern is one which
is objectively correct

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:00.670
but is also felt by
you to be correct.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:07.990
A good example is
in a piece in which

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:11.650
he tries to explain to
a young architecture

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:17.200
student at Berkeley
what he's all about.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.070
He says, look at this table.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:22.930
They're sitting in a cafe.

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:24.700
He says, look at this table.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.010
It's made of wood.

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:30.200
There's the difference
between making the edge

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.910
and finishing the edge of
the wood with sandpaper,

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:38.390
making the minimal transition
from one service to another,

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:42.300
versus the machine-like
one, which our table is,

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:49.690
which has just rounded it off
in a very blunt, crude way.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:53.440
He asked the student,
which of these two

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.930
is a representation
of your good self?

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:00.610
The student doesn't understand
what he's talking about.

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:06.040
Why should the edge
of a table represent

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:10.570
your psychological whole?

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:14.440
I quote, "but what if
I ask you to tell me

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.530
which of these two tables
you're more willing to take

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:20.830
as a picture of your own self?

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:23.680
Which of the two would you
consider a better candidate

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.600
to picture of your own soul?"

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.230
And so on-- everything.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.410
The trouble is that
it's difficult to write

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:38.470
such patterns.

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:44.500
We don't have the tools yet.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:49.780
We may one day have
them to do that.

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:53.500
These patterns which are
printed in the book, A Pattern

00:36:53.500 --> 00:37:02.410
Language, on biblical paper is
almost a giveaway of a kind.

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:11.140
For instance,
Pattern on page 115--

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:14.230
there's abundant evidence to
show that high buildings make

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.980
people crazy.

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:20.300
Now, objectively,
this is not true.

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:31.550
There may be reasons why
tall buildings are harmful.

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:38.000
But it is an abstract pattern
or is a theoretical pattern

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.320
derived from observation.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.880
It's not true.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:46.730
I can quote you
from Herbert Gans,

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:51.890
a well-known urban sociologist
who once taught here at MIT.

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:56.000
I quote, "thus, whether housing
is high- or low-rise does not,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.650
by itself, make
much difference."

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:02.660
The luxury apartment
house has been

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:10.690
built in New York City for
well over a century now,

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:13.460
and no one has yet discovered
that the buildings jammed

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:18.830
on Park and Fifth Avenues and
so forth generate pathology.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.930
Conversely, when
poor people live

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:24.500
in even the best-designed
low-rise projects,

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.240
they still do not escape
the problems of poverty.

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:33.260
Gans is correct.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:36.950
Why does Alexander
make such a statement?

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:41.030
He's too intelligent to
know that his statement is

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:42.620
incorrect.

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.020
I don't know.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:48.140
I don't know.

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:58.310
There's a kind of insistence
that either you, in--

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:03.260
when I learned debating, I
was taught that sometimes it's

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:07.910
a good idea to throw out a
statement, an assumption,

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:14.570
a hypothesis just to make the
argument more interesting.

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:16.640
And if your opponent
didn't catch up

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.830
on the weakness of your
argument, you would win.

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:24.200
I don't think Alexander's
into debating games.

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.250
But it's often puzzled me
why he took the trouble

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:32.180
to assemble often
very good ideas, very

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:34.085
down-to-earth ideas.

00:39:34.085 --> 00:39:41.030
He, for instance, says
single designers don't really

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:44.960
produce comprehensive results.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.500
He says, I work in the College
of Environmental Design

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:54.380
at Berkeley, which was designed
by a team of the best highly

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.735
trained architects
in our college.

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:02.270
I can't put plants on
the sill in my window

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:05.090
because nobody ever
thought about what

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:07.700
the best position
of the window would

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:11.540
be in the section of the wall.

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:15.560
They pushed the
window to the inside

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:19.220
to allow a maximum of
use on the outside where

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:22.760
there's no need for any use.

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:27.650
Why do intelligent people
make such stupid assumptions?

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:30.920
They never consulted us.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:35.030
Well, if an architect
were redesigning

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:39.290
MIT's School of Architecture
and asked me about my office,

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:42.680
I don't know if I would
remember to specify

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:46.220
that the window needs to be
on the outside of the wall

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:51.500
to allow me the space on
the inside for my plants

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.685
or for whatever.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:59.950
So his observation is
that somehow, the system

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:01.330
isn't working.

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:05.690
Modern urbanism is a mess.

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:08.720
So he proposes a
number of rules.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.000
I won't go through the rules.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:18.570
You can see them
in his later book,

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:21.640
A New Theory of Urban Design.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:27.470
There are rules about growing
a whole, about piecemeal,

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:32.740
unpredictable coherence, full
of feeling, no single artist.

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:39.770
There are many people involved,
the whole idea of a thing

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:40.870
having to have feeling.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:52.570
The seven rules-- let
me find the one about--

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.170
rule number three, visions.

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:06.300
Every project must first be
experienced and then expressed

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:10.482
as a vision which can be
seen in the inner eye.

00:42:10.482 --> 00:42:14.870
I don't know where my inner
eye is and how to use it.

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:15.840
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:17.550
JULIAN BEINART: It
must have this quality

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:24.540
so strongly that it can also
be communicated to others

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:27.855
and felt by others as a vision.

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:46.810
At least Alexander is attempting
to be explicit about his ideas.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:51.490
Explicitness is an
advantage in debate.

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:55.690
And explicitness, even
if you make mistakes,

00:42:55.690 --> 00:43:01.090
is better than dull hermiticism.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:08.080
And all of these people
are generating explicitness

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:11.905
as one of the aspects
of their work.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:40.110
In the handout I
gave to you, there's

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:45.000
a piece from A New Theory
of Urban Design, this.

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:56.940
On the left is a piece
of Rome, a plan of Rome

00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:01.110
around the Pantheon,
medieval Rome, as opposed

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:05.190
to an American suburb.

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:08.190
What are the
characteristics of the world

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:12.330
depicted on the left-- a good
world, according to Alexander?

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:23.750
The whole is made up of parts
which are unique but belong

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:27.440
to families of shape.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:31.820
There are churches, which
all have open space in front

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:39.980
of them-- the Pantheon, and so
on, Sant'Ignazio, Sant'GesÃº.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:45.350
There are patterns of
housing which repeat.

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:52.850
There are decisions which are
made through piecemeal addition

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:55.820
rather than through a ramp
in the industrial production.

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:02.770
There's a family of
belongingness of all the parts.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:17.970
In a sense-- although I don't
know who had the vision which

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:21.090
produced this plan, I don't
think there was one person,

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:25.810
one pope who said Rome
would be this way--

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:30.420
but there were
patterns, presumably,

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:38.580
which people learned
from other patterns

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:43.590
and decided to reproduce
them in a piecemeal way.

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:46.830
So building up from
experience, building up

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:53.340
from categories of knowledge
which had already been tested,

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:57.728
as opposed to this
machine-like production.

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.241
Alexander is tough medicine.

00:46:09.241 --> 00:46:15.775
He can come across
as an arrogant fool.

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:22.710
He recently produced
four volumes

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:26.280
called The Nature of Order.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.570
He's even more explicit.

00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:32.770
In The Nature of
Order, I have tried

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:35.260
to construct a coherent
picture of life

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:39.940
on Earth which makes sense of
these matters, that gives us

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:43.840
something to live for
and worth living for.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:48.100
Yes, like Geddes, I am
trying, at the same time,

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:52.900
to deal with the emotional world
and the objective, ordinary

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.010
world around us.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:01.040
What is extraordinary
is he writes

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:05.030
about A Pattern Language.

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:08.810
By about 1975, these
investigations,

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:12.500
which I undertook with five
colleagues, gave us gold.

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:17.630
We discovered about 250
invariant spatial patterns.

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:20.180
Each one was associated
with the stability

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:23.090
of human environmental studies.

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:25.430
They were published
in A Pattern Language.

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:28.790
They have become a standard
part of what is known and used

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:29.720
by architects.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:38.520
Well, what's this all about?

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.890
It's not true.

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:43.760
So why does a man say
something which is not true?

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:51.430
It can only be provocative.

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:56.020
And perhaps like
John McEnroe shouting

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:59.380
at an umpire in
a tennis game, he

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:06.680
had a reason for provoking
response, dealing

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:12.200
with satisfaction of his
inner grief publicly.

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:17.040
I can only, without doing
a psychoanalysis of this,

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.700
be surprised by it.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:28.220
The fact is that architects
seldom read a book

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:30.170
like Pattern Language.

00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:35.430
And they're not in the
habit of taking a statement

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:40.980
like "tall buildings are
a danger to human health"

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:43.680
seriously.

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.810
One last thing
before we move on--

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:56.260
in his latest work,
he claims that there

00:48:56.260 --> 00:49:01.380
are a body of patterns.

00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:05.470
I'll use his words.

00:49:09.637 --> 00:49:12.340
The idea of how much
life is in things

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:16.000
is subjective in the
sense of observation.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.640
This quality of life
seems to be correlated

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:22.840
with the repeated appearance
of 15 geometric properties.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.430
The appearance of living
structure in things

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:32.110
is also correlated--

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:35.260
so on, and so on.

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:40.120
He's now reduced the
complexity to the repetition

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:43.330
of 15 patterns.

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:45.490
I haven't seen these patterns.

00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:48.100
I don't know what they are.

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:52.640
But the observation that
complexity can be reduced to 15

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.250
repeated patterns--

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:58.420
they are probably
centrally focused.

00:49:58.420 --> 00:49:59.640
I don't know what they are.

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:04.180
He says they are true
in art, in urbanism,

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:08.200
in everything that
speaks of life.

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.770
What is it that speaks of life?

00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:17.260
I understand that walking
down the street in Italy,

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:21.250
in almost any
small Italian town,

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:28.600
will resonate a certain quality
which evokes being alive.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:29.620
There's energy.

00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:32.410
There's organization.

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:34.720
There's all of the
elements that you

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:39.490
might encounter,
actually or subliminally,

00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:41.920
which would say this is lively.

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:48.740
Versus a shopping center
parking lot on Sunday afternoon,

00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:54.220
at any time of the week,
would not evoke that.

00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:59.770
We can spend a couple of
hours starting to write down,

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:04.630
what would cause you to
experience something as being

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:07.100
alive and something
which wasn't?

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:16.390
I don't know what to say about
the body of work of Alexander.

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:21.220
It's going to be a pity that
he has spent so much energy

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:34.300
and will have such a little
observable impact on the way we

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.025
make buildings and make cities.

00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:43.690
You are a good test group.

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:46.750
Have you been influenced by
Christopher Alexander's work?

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:52.970
A little bit?

00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:54.680
A little bit, yeah.

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:56.950
I would say the same thing.

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:03.910
John Habraken was head of the
Department of Architecture

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:08.750
here at MIT for a
number of years.

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:33.690
When he was in Holland, he wrote
a little book called Supports

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:37.710
in which he argued that there
was a distinction between two

00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:41.595
aspects of building.

00:52:41.595 --> 00:52:47.760
The one which he called supports
was the infrastructure which

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:50.340
allowed habitation
to take place--

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:55.680
all the pipes, all the
structure, all the material.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:53:00.370
And he separated that
from a human capacity--

00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:02.010
which, for want
of a better word,

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:04.500
I think his word
was indwelling--

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:07.320
that was the creative
capacity that all people

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:11.220
had to determine their
own microenvironment.

00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:25.610
Supports were basic items which
enabled individual creativity.

00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:49.160
When he decided to engage
these ideas in a larger world,

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:52.700
he came upon the
idea that the best

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:56.630
way to understand
the actions of a city

00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:59.930
were to understand it
is a set of agreements.

00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:10.220
Agreements are required
for the production

00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:12.550
of any pieces of city.

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:20.220
It's, of course,
not actually true.

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:33.370
But in his view, the agreements
between differing parties,

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:39.190
surprisingly, could
produce environments

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:42.625
in which certain
aspects were agreed upon

00:54:42.625 --> 00:54:47.035
and certain aspects
were not agreed upon.

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:54.340
It's difficult to understand
some of his material.

00:54:54.340 --> 00:55:00.550
He's written quite widely.

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:04.960
His writings include pieces
like The Control of Complexity,

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:08.725
which is in your reading,
a number of others.

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:21.630
Essentially, his work is best
explicated in a piece of work

00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:27.030
he did here at MIT called
The Grunsfeld Variations.

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:32.720
There's a publication of
it available in the MIT

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:33.815
publication list--

00:55:33.815 --> 00:55:35.150
I don't know where that is--

00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:41.370
a piece of work which
he did with students.

00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:47.580
I will use it to
explain, perhaps better,

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:50.460
what his larger ideas are.

00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:01.470
The two diagrams you
have in your handout--

00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:10.650
the one is a plan of
the Grunsfeld variation,

00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:11.579
which is this.

00:56:15.491 --> 00:56:18.020
This is a set of
redesigned blocks

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:21.260
in the Back Bay of Boston.

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:24.590
Agreements are
reached that there

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:29.390
will be high-density
but low-rise buildings.

00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:33.740
Agreement is reached that there
will be parking underground.

00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:37.250
But halfway, there are streets.

00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:43.820
And the parking will
be set in such a way

00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:47.240
that you can have two
kinds of conditions--

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:52.760
a half-parking level,
a full-parking level,

00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:55.100
and variations of
the street height.

00:56:57.690 --> 00:56:59.520
I'm not sure that
I remember what

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:03.060
all the other agreements were.

00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:15.030
He then says we can learn
from the tissue of this area.

00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:18.420
Exactly what he's
learned, I don't know.

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:22.140
It's not-- you have to look
at each of these projects

00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:25.170
to understand what.

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:28.230
But you can see in
the diagrams, there

00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:37.650
are tendencies to reproduce the
length of facades and so on.

00:57:37.650 --> 00:57:42.000
What he argues is
that here are a set

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:48.180
of different interpretations of
a similar set of instructions.

00:57:51.430 --> 00:58:05.470
They all describe a
variety of outcomes

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:09.940
based on the same
agreements, meta-agreements.

00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:20.470
In the little diagram, which I
handed out to you by student,

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:26.200
extending the physical
structure of a small town

00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:33.340
in Ladakh, in northern India,
he does these exercises

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:38.425
with students, in which you
start off with a basic theme.

00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:46.650
The theme is what the culture
is already reproducing.

00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:52.640
You understand the
variations that

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:57.320
are possible on that
theme, what agreements have

00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:02.930
to be made to extend the items
in different ways, what becomes

00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:08.510
private, what becomes public,
what is negotiated, and so on.

00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:14.330
And it sets up a pattern
which can grow over time

00:59:14.330 --> 00:59:17.330
with new agreements made
for the use of roofs

00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:19.550
as the density grows and so on.

00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:29.500
There are two problems
with Habraken's work.

00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:33.670
One, again, it is
essentially apolitical.

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:40.090
I don't mean politics
in the Democratic Party

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:42.640
versus Republican Party sense.

00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:49.600
I meant in the notion that
all agreements turn out

00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:56.110
to be responsible outcomes.

00:59:56.110 --> 00:59:57.310
I don't know what--

00:59:57.310 --> 01:00:01.510
Habraken is using
a methodology which

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:06.190
distinguishes the
existing form of Amsterdam

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:12.050
from the new extension of
Amsterdam by modern architects.

01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:16.525
Habraken claims that it's
the modern architects who

01:00:16.525 --> 01:00:20.290
have lost all of the
understanding of what

01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:22.870
agreements are.

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:28.330
He doesn't specify what
bad agreements are.

01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:32.230
Habraken doesn't do this
on Long Island, where

01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:35.650
there may be waste
space, buildings

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:40.790
in the middle of sites with
open space around them.

01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:46.330
These are all dense,
built-together systems,

01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:54.280
much like the original plans
and the early expansions

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.900
of the city of Amsterdam.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:02.360
So I don't know what--

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:08.870
I can't explain the strategy.

01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:13.670
The strategy is that,
again, like Alexander, you

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:17.000
learn from what exists.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.430
You use your discerning capacity
to build on what exists.

01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:32.610
You don't-- in Alexander's case,
when he did Oregon experiment,

01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:37.080
he said, we will not build
individual large buildings all

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.370
by themselves.

01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:46.420
In the program, for every
large building of classrooms,

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:48.820
you need 10% of shops.

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:51.580
You need 5% of open space.

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:57.430
You need 20% of housing.

01:01:57.430 --> 01:02:03.400
All of these patterns
are breaking down

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:07.120
programs, which are
large and mononuclear,

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:15.040
into complex patterns and
repeated in small parts,

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.470
in small spatial entities.

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:22.620
These people have--

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:28.730
John Habraken has gone quite
far in developing technologies

01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:37.580
for user situations
in support systems.

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:46.730
But both Alexander
and Habraken's notions

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:51.560
are intellectually
very responsible.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.970
They are conservative.

01:02:55.530 --> 01:02:59.510
I don't know what you do
when you build a new town.

01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:01.320
You don't have
any infrastructure

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:09.210
to build a contrapuntal
system around.

01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:11.850
And I'm sure that
that can be resolved

01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:15.420
by assuming a set of
agreements early on,

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:20.490
based on some ingredients
from the broader

01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:23.310
culture of the place and so on.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:34.515
We've got a few minutes to touch
on a different set of stories.

01:03:40.090 --> 01:03:42.400
Billy Hillier and
Julienne Hanson

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:51.900
wrote a book called The Social
Logic of Space in which they

01:03:51.900 --> 01:04:04.990
argued, essentially, that
the spatial pattern which

01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:11.930
surrounds us affects us.

01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:14.330
They argued a lot
against the notion

01:04:14.330 --> 01:04:19.670
of architectural determinism,
which argues that architecture

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:22.340
determines our lives.

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:28.430
They showed that only
under certain conditions

01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:32.780
does the spatial pattern
really have effects.

01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:37.610
The space syntax-- syntax
is a word from linguistics.

01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:44.480
It refers to the proper order
of words in a sentence in order

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:46.910
for it to make sense.

01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:51.140
In some languages, the
verb precedes the noun--

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:54.500
I eat a fish.

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.090
In other languages--

01:04:56.090 --> 01:04:57.560
I, the fish, eat.

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:06.420
Each has a syntax
which makes sense.

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:09.050
And linguists can probably
explain the reasons

01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:14.440
why one system works and
the other doesn't work.

01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:22.930
The work that has been
known as space syntax

01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:26.410
really is more recent.

01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:29.380
It's the work which is
published in this book,

01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:35.740
Space is the Machine, which
is an extensive document.

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:40.870
And if any of you are
interested in this idea,

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:43.510
you should probably try
to read parts of it.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:51.040
Essentially, the argument
is that behavior--

01:05:57.990 --> 01:06:00.710
that you need to understand
the space of the city

01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:04.370
before you can understand
any of its elements.

01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:08.570
The space of the city,
in the application

01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:15.590
of this space syntax
model, is a theory

01:06:15.590 --> 01:06:19.310
based upon movement patterns.

01:06:19.310 --> 01:06:25.460
Crudely speaking, they say that
the movement pattern in a city

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:31.160
is a function of the pattern
that is shaped in order

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:35.330
to cause the movement or
that allows the movement

01:06:35.330 --> 01:06:38.100
to take place.

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:52.460
So in a town which has
space for movement,

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:56.030
they can distinguish
in what they

01:06:56.030 --> 01:07:03.200
call high correlation, which
is the number of connections

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:08.360
that are possible with a minimum
number of separate moves.

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:17.540
And low correlation
represents a change of pattern

01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:20.375
which involves the
maximum number of moves.

01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:25.330
I'm putting it rather crudely.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:33.650
By this, you can
characterize the layout

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:41.465
of a town in terms of this
capacity of movement to flow.

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:52.680
They were correlating encounter
rates with a space syntax

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:53.760
methodology.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:58.510
In other words, if you wish to
create a system in which there

01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:02.250
are random encounter
acts, it was not only

01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:04.330
a function of density.

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:05.905
It's a function,
also, of pattern.

01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:12.810
And it's also-- although they're
a little unclear about this,

01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:20.010
it's not so clearly a result of
a particular land use pattern.

01:08:20.010 --> 01:08:24.930
If Marlene Dietrich was
singing tonight in east Boston,

01:08:24.930 --> 01:08:27.960
I might go to east Boston.

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:30.359
I wouldn't normally
go to east Boston.

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:32.748
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

01:08:32.748 --> 01:08:34.290
JULIAN BEINART: But
then the argument

01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:39.000
would be that Marlene Dietrich
would sing in a space which

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.569
is easily available to me.

01:08:42.569 --> 01:08:47.010
Andres Sevtsuk, who did
his PhD here two years ago,

01:08:47.010 --> 01:08:51.300
has taken some elements
of the space syntax model

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:56.910
and correlated it with
patterns of movement

01:08:56.910 --> 01:09:01.390
and commercial
location in Cambridge.

01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:07.359
It's a branching
off of space syntax.

01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:10.140
It's not really space
syntax because it doesn't

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:12.105
develop theoretical models.

01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:21.060
He just bases it on
observation, a very fine,

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:22.560
detailed observation.

01:09:28.819 --> 01:09:34.729
The value of space
syntax, presumably,

01:09:34.729 --> 01:09:40.770
is in its correlation with
social good dimensions.

01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:46.130
So for instance, the
analysis of spatial patterns

01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:51.590
would suggest that crime rates
are much lower where there

01:09:51.590 --> 01:10:01.100
is a high encounter rate, so
that housing estates which

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:05.960
turn their backs on to
conventional streets

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:10.580
and have their access from
private, unguarded domains

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:15.380
in the center, are
much more likely to be

01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:20.810
available for
burglary and others.

01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:23.060
And this correlates.

01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:25.410
Their work is
expanded enormously.

01:10:25.410 --> 01:10:28.280
They have now have
computer programs which

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:31.985
you can buy and play yourself.

01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:38.940
They consult all over the world.

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:45.770
I have shown you one of the
little projects in one drawing.

01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:50.455
That's the Trafalgar
Square problem.

01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:59.570
Now, you can say that
everything that they've

01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:05.300
built as a theoretical model
and what they've actually

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:08.245
found on the ground
is something that you,

01:11:08.245 --> 01:11:11.930
as an intelligent
observer, could have told.

01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:17.120
There's something obvious about
what this enormous investment

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:21.710
of energy and mind produces.

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:24.860
I was always told
when I studied--

01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:29.540
there's an class in
urban sociology at Yale--

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:32.390
that I should understand
that sociology

01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:37.040
is about everyday things and
that you shouldn't be surprised

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:45.408
if sociological conclusions
accompany everyday observation.

01:11:45.408 --> 01:11:45.950
I don't know.

01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:52.730
It's a question which
critics of space syntax

01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:56.480
have been very
frequent to say, why

01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:01.490
waste the money on something
which produces nothing new

01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:05.720
and just confirms what
you can intuitively know?

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.630
If there are obstacles
to where people can walk,

01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:09.950
people won't walk there--

01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:15.890
to reduce it to a rather,
sort of base level.

01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:26.970
It had a-- what do you think
of the presentation you heard?

01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:29.640
STUDENT: The one thing that I
thought was interesting was,

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:34.500
towards the end, he was
proposing they were going to--

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:37.590
if you were to redevelop over
the train yards in London.

01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:42.080
And he showed if you
just put a grid down

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.610
where the potential
commercial streets would be,

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:46.068
because they
color-map the streets.

01:12:46.068 --> 01:12:47.193
JULIAN BEINART: Sure, sure.

01:12:47.193 --> 01:12:49.560
STUDENT: And he said, but
if you did this pattern,

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.750
then you can see, oh,
this, according to him,

01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:57.240
would probably make a really
good commercial street.

01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.370
And these would be residential.

01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:04.500
It's sort of a way to
quantitatively understand

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:10.860
non-grid patterns in a way that
you could present to a planning

01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:11.820
board or a government.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:12.695
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah.

01:13:12.695 --> 01:13:15.330
STUDENT: It was interesting.

01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:22.740
JULIAN BEINART: Yeah, the
adjustments to the King's Cross

01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:25.800
site plan were interesting.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:30.100
I think a couple of things.

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:37.140
Number one, it satisfies me when
somebody methodologically shows

01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:41.955
that the form of things
has meaning, has value.

01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:49.970
If you think that high encounter
rates are a good thing,

01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:52.480
at least they will tell
you how to accomplish it.

01:13:55.250 --> 01:14:00.010
And that's not a bad
set of propositions.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:09.380
We understand, actually, very
little about high encounter

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:10.670
rates.

01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:12.605
We assume them to be good.

01:14:12.605 --> 01:14:17.960
And Manhattan has had a history
of, since its early days,

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:21.470
making sure that sidewalks
on its major avenues

01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:25.040
are wide enough to
take a lot of people.

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:25.965
Tokyo hasn't.

01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:34.190
The sidewalks are too narrow
for the pedestrian volume.

01:14:34.190 --> 01:14:38.120
And one could imagine
that the encounter rates--

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:43.770
the difficulty about
encounter rates

01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:49.140
is that, often, people use them
to believe that that is good.

01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:51.900
Richard Sennett, I
think, naively believes

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:57.600
that it's good for
public relations.

01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:01.800
When I walk down Fifth Avenue,
I don't stop and talk to a woman

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:07.200
with a fur and a dog.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:11.540
I'd probably be shot
or be accused of--

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:14.550
you know.

01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:20.340
Crowds are not naturally
places which enable--

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:23.610
often, they don't enable
human communication.

01:15:23.610 --> 01:15:26.940
So encounter rates
are, in themselves,

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:30.120
not absolute good
or absolute bad.

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:34.980
But certainly, the
notion that you feel--

01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:36.540
when do you feel safer?

01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:39.540
In all cultures, when
you are on streets

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:41.430
with a lot of other people--

01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:42.450
I can imagine.

01:15:42.450 --> 01:15:44.160
I've been in places
where I've been

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:47.640
shit-scared of
being on the street

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:49.710
with a lot of other
people because they all

01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:54.450
look like criminals to
me, because I couldn't

01:15:54.450 --> 01:15:58.170
read the situation well enough.

01:15:58.170 --> 01:16:03.300
The last set of stuff
has a body of literature.

01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:08.220
And I've only chosen one page
from one of the documents.

01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:11.790
There's a good book called Urban
Space and Structures, which

01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:15.870
those of you serious about
becoming urban designers

01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:18.240
need to read.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:26.370
It's edited by Leslie Martin
and Lionel March, Cambridge

01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:33.190
University Press, 1972.

01:16:33.190 --> 01:16:35.890
The British have been
interested in understanding

01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:38.485
spatial patterns largely
through geometry.

01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:46.910
In the piece that I've
given to you today,

01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:50.230
on the right-hand
side is a section

01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:56.560
of the grid of New York from
42nd to 52nd and from Eighth

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:57.855
Avenue to Park Avenue.

01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:05.650
The argument is
relatively simple.

01:17:05.650 --> 01:17:10.810
If you took the amount
of gross square footage

01:17:10.810 --> 01:17:18.760
built on this parcel in
the black areas today,

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:21.880
and you took away a
number of the streets--

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:26.770
he took away every second
street, more or less--

01:17:26.770 --> 01:17:31.480
you could rebuild the same
amount of square footage

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:35.470
in the pattern on the right
with only a maximum height

01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:39.715
of seven floors and large
amounts of open space inside.

01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:46.630
Now, no architecture
student I know of

01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:51.190
would come to that
conclusion automatically.

01:17:51.190 --> 01:17:57.580
It's much like the use
of the Fresnel lens

01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:02.485
in arguing population in a city.

01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:28.450
As you go outwards, if you
want the same area of land,

01:18:28.450 --> 01:18:31.000
as you get further
out, these bands

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.040
need to become thinner because
the area they cover is larger.

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:38.950
So the total population
in the center of the city

01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:44.710
can be housed in a thin
band on the outside.

01:18:44.710 --> 01:18:53.480
This is not-- there's a
diminishing amount of width

01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:58.070
required in each band as you
go further out because the band

01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:59.570
becomes larger.

01:18:59.570 --> 01:19:01.910
It's a simple
geometric observation

01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:05.890
which they apply
to some estimates

01:19:05.890 --> 01:19:07.490
about urban population.

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:16.190
The number of books published--

01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:18.500
I will come back to
the work of this group

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:25.250
when we talk about prediction
of growth and flexibility

01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:27.526
of building apparatus.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:37.030
A lot of this work came from
a set of investigations that

01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:44.540
the British did at the
end of the '39-'46 war

01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:48.810
in the rebuilding of British
infrastructure-- hospitals,

01:19:48.810 --> 01:19:50.840
universities, and so on.

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.670
I will do a series
of case studies

01:19:52.670 --> 01:20:00.530
of a number of university
plans showing two factors--

01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:10.490
one, the idea that new groups of
knowledge disciplines cohered--

01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:16.680
microbiology as opposed
to microphysics, biology

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:22.020
and chemistry mixing
together, and so on--

01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:26.780
how these patterns
could be accommodated

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:34.190
in physical form which required
the least adjustment over time.

01:20:34.190 --> 01:20:37.760
We will look at the Technical
University in Berlin.

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:45.050
We will look at MIT as examples
of these patterns which

01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:49.070
maintain-- which promote
high degrees of flexibility.

01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:51.660
Also, in the British
writing about hospitals,

01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:53.930
the research done in hospitals.

01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:58.160
Knowing that hospitals
change hospital science

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:01.460
and the administration
changes rapidly,

01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:04.910
how would you choose
patterns which

01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:13.470
enabled the minimum disruption
in the trajectory of change?

01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:18.180
So if any of you are interested
in this kind of work,

01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:20.060
this is not the class to take.

01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:22.010
I can just tell you.

01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:24.990
We'll touch on some
of this later on.

01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:29.280
But I can just read you
some of the list of books

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.780
this comes from.

01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:32.660
There's Philip
Steadman's book called

01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:35.390
Architectural Morphology.

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:40.280
There's Philip Steadman's
book The Evolution of Design.

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:46.370
There's Lionel March and Philip
Steadman's book The Geometry

01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:52.250
of Environment, MIT Press, 1974.

01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:56.540
There's a couple of the
more generally applied

01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:58.610
outcomes of much of this work.

01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:05.700
We've finished the
first part of the three

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.170
sections of this class.

01:22:08.170 --> 01:22:10.860
This first part
was just an attempt

01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:15.300
to bring you up to speed on
some things which you might not

01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:17.100
have known about.

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:19.530
We start the serious work on--

01:22:19.530 --> 01:22:20.340
what is today?

01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:21.990
Tuesday.

01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:24.990
We start the serious
work on Thursday.

01:22:24.990 --> 01:22:32.190
We will start excavating the
spatial pattern of existing

01:22:32.190 --> 01:22:36.750
cities after the
Industrial Revolution.

01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:42.480
We'll, on Thursday,
try to make sense

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:47.790
of what industrialism
meant, what

01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:51.510
it meant to spatial patterns
in cities, what it meant

01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:55.770
to the invention of
new instruments--

01:22:55.770 --> 01:23:00.390
the mortgage system,
deficit spending, and so

01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:08.700
on, the advent of poverty
in accumulated situations

01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:12.370
in the West, and so on.

01:23:12.370 --> 01:23:14.910
And from that, we
will make case studies

01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:17.040
of the major reactions--

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:22.200
London, Paris, Vienna,
Barcelona, and Chicago.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:27.630
This is a comprehensive look
at some very detailed aspects

01:23:27.630 --> 01:23:31.500
of existing transformations.

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:34.260
Hopefully, by the time we
get to the end of the class,

01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:38.970
we'll be able to make
theoretical generalizations

01:23:38.970 --> 01:23:46.690
better than the ones I've
explained to you so far.

01:23:46.690 --> 01:23:49.570
Don't be too depressed.

01:23:49.570 --> 01:23:53.200
The remarkable thing is
that we are building cities.

01:23:53.200 --> 01:24:01.180
We build them, perhaps, not
as well spatially as we did

01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:04.380
150 years ago or 300 years ago.

01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:15.200
But there's no more cholera
because of the great invention

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:23.300
in 1854 in London, causing
the biggest transformation

01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:29.810
of London by siphoning
off wastewater

01:24:29.810 --> 01:24:37.630
on the east and west sides,
north and south of London.

01:24:37.630 --> 01:24:41.160
All of this will
build up a story

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:49.110
about the complexity of
actual urban situations, which

01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:52.740
I believe is better
than too much time

01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:56.790
spending on abstract models.

01:24:56.790 --> 01:25:00.480
I don't know if we'll ever
have a theory of city form

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:08.700
which is universally agreed
upon, able to be systematized.

01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:12.570
Some aspects of the performance
of this field, which

01:25:12.570 --> 01:25:15.590
are moving more and
more in this direction--

01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:19.020
we certainly know more
about public transportation

01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:24.120
and its engineering and
science than ever before.

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:29.400
We know very little
about meaning.

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:34.950
We build pickle-shaped
tall buildings in London

01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:39.630
without even being able
to measure the effect.

01:25:39.630 --> 01:25:41.250
And there are parts
of the world which

01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:48.210
are looking to manifest urban
identity without building

01:25:48.210 --> 01:25:51.480
the tallest building
in the world,

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:54.330
and a number of issues of
that kind which are currently

01:25:54.330 --> 01:25:57.060
on the plate of urban designers.

01:25:57.060 --> 01:25:57.570
OK.

01:25:57.570 --> 01:25:59.410
I'll see you on Thursday.

01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:01.970
Have a good holiday.
