WEBVTT

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.080
PROFESSOR: So let's
talk about the transfer

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.500
of respiratory pathogens, and
in particular, contagious

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.930
pathogens such as
viruses and bacteria,

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.750
that infect the
respiratory system.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.690
The way that such pathogens
are normally transferred

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.860
is through droplets which are
emitted by respiration, which

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.910
could be by just normal
breathing, coughing, sneezing,

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.580
et cetera.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.730
And so here is a sketch
of an infected person who

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.730
is undergoing respiration and is
emitting droplets into the air.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.150
And so let's think about what
is the fate of those droplets,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.350
what it could be.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.930
So one possibility is if
the droplets are very heavy,

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.240
they're just going to
settle to the ground.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.330
And then they may
collect on the ground

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.370
or on some other surface.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.040
And then somebody else
could touch that surface

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.960
and transmit it,
perhaps by touching

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.700
their eyes or some other--

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.320
or their nose or some
bodily entrance point.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.970
And that sort of transmission
is called fomite transmission.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.750
So these dried up
bits of droplets

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.030
on the surface are
called fomites.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.430
And this mode of
transfer would involve

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.930
settling of those droplets to
the surface, to a surface, OK?

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.250
Now, another possibility is
that the droplets kind of float

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.650
around, and if
they're small enough,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.390
they might actually evaporate
and they might disappear.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.070
So they might evaporate.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.729
And at that point, if
there's a pathogen in them,

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.680
that pathogen may
still be around,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.810
but perhaps if it
loses enough fluid

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.240
it's going to lose
its viability.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.050
And so perhaps those
droplets would be eliminated.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.670
And then finally,
there are droplets

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.000
which undergo neither
of these and remain

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.130
floating indefinitely, or at
least for long periods of time,

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.639
let's say for
hours, in the space.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.240
And these are called
aerosol droplets.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.310
So these are droplets
that are very small.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.220
They don't really settle in
a reasonable amount of time.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.260
But they're not necessarily
evaporating either.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.260
And so they are present.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.670
And if another person is
here, they can very easily

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.310
breathe in those droplets, OK?

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.520
Now, how do we know
which of these outcomes

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.260
is possible for droplets that
are emitted from respiration?

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.600
So what it really depends
on at the simplest level

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.040
is the size of the droplet.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.870
So the droplet fate
depends on its size.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.079
So why don't we do
some simple estimates

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.660
of these different processes?

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.720
So the first would be
looking at settling.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:14.600
So the settling time
from a height L,

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.480
which might be the height of a
person, a typical number that's

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.300
taken is 2 meters for a
settling problem like this.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.010
It's given by the
following formula,

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.590
assuming we have
so-called Stokes'

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.590
law of settling is
valid, which it usually

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.510
is for small droplets.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.210
And that would be that--

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.890
I'll just write
the formula first.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.150
2 rho g R^2.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.120
So basically, there's a 9/2.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.050
L is the height which
they're going to fall.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:53.520
So basically this is L. And mu_a
is the viscosity of the air,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.790
rho is the density of the
air-- or density the droplet,

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.329
excuse me, of the liquid.

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.180
And g is the gravitational
acceleration,

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.140
and R is the size
of the droplet.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.330
So the size of the droplet
is R -- or that's the radius.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.990
So what you see here is that
when the radius gets bigger,

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.390
the drops fall faster, and
hence the time goes down.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.500
So very large droplets will
very quickly settle out.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.350
Others -- as R goes to
be smaller and smaller --

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.770
they might be suspended
and become aerosols.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.260
We also might worry about
evaporation, for the smaller

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.490
droplets especially.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.780
And the evaporation time,
again with a fairly simple

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.260
approximation of pure
liquid which is evaporating.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.730
Basically, just as it's
getting more highly curved,

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.290
the molecules will have a bigger
driving force to be removed.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.330
And if it's a
diffusion-limited process,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.900
which is basically water
vapor has to diffuse away

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.620
into the environment, then you
can show the evaporation time

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.500
is the initial size
of the droplet, R_0 --

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.420
so let's just say R_0
is the initial size.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.050
And maybe here,
when it's settling,

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.300
it could still be evaporating.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.320
So R could be varying.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.780
But why don't we
just neglect that

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.070
for droplets settling quickly.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.800
Maybe that's roughly
the initial size.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.060
And here for evaporation,
there is a constant,

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.980
which I'll call D_bar,
which is just something

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.660
that has units of diffusivity.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.580
So length squared per time.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.300
And then (1-RH), where
RH is the relative humidity.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.620
So basically, the tendency
for the water droplets

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.080
to be removed from a liquid
droplet end up in the air

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.090
has to do with the relative
humidity of the air.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.400
So that's another factor
that comes in here.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.800
So if we plot these
two results, we

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.750
arrive at the
so-called Wells curve,

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:53.800
which was first formulated by
epidemiologist Wells in 1934.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.500
And I'll draw that over here.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.720
And the Wells curve
is sketched like this.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:10.250
It says that if we have the
drop size R_0 on one axis,

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.970
and on the other axis we have
the time of settling-- the time

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.260
that the droplet
has left the mouth,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.910
then you have basically
two expressions here.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.120
So the settling is
something like this,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.810
where it's a function that
goes to 0, like 1/R squared.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.680
On the other hand,
evaporation is the fastest

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.770
for the smallest droplets.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.310
You see that it goes
like (R_0)^2.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.720
So it has a dependence
more like this.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.610
And so basically, these curves
intersect at a certain point

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.370
here.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.550
And if you ask yourself,
if I am a droplet of,

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.290
let's say, this size here,
then as time goes on,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.340
I hit this point, and
this is where I evaporate.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.610
So for just a pure liquid
droplet, at that time,

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.850
that droplet would disappear.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:14.440
On the other hand, if I
have a larger droplet that's

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.410
going to hit this
other curve first,

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.540
then these droplets will
settle, because before they

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.340
have time to evaporate,
which would require

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.600
all the way going
to here, they've

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.800
already fallen to the ground.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.290
They may continue
evaporating on the ground,

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.420
and you're eventually left
with a dried up residue

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.480
of some of the
material that may have

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.760
been contained in the droplet.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.520
And then there's a crossover.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.400
And so generically, you
expect this kind of behavior

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.230
for droplets that are
evaporating and settling.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.740
So the Wells curve was
first formulated in 1934.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.120
And if we just want to put
some numbers on here, if we're

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.680
talking about pure water,
then this crossover

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.590
happens around 70 microns.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:06.900
And the time is
around 3 seconds.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.440
So that gives you
a sense, basically,

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.020
of how quickly the larger
droplets are settling faster

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.790
than 3 seconds, and then the
small droplets are evaporating

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:19.680
a lot faster.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.850
And by the way, to get a
sense of how fast they are,

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.010
if we look at the dependents,
each of these is squared.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.860
So if we want to go by a
factor of 100, if you go to,

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:33.909
let's say, 0.7 microns,
which is 700 nanometers,

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.500
it's a factor of 100.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.640
But the time comes in squared.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.640
So it's 3e-4 seconds.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.400
So we're talking
0.3 milliseconds.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.450
So basically, droplets that are
in the 1 micron or below range,

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.900
if they're pure liquid, they'll
evaporate extremely quickly.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.390
And conversely, if we
consider much larger droplets,

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.450
let's say that are bigger
by a factor of 10 or 100,

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.700
that also comes in squared
in terms of the settling

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.360
time being reduced.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.730
And so we would then end up with
100, or up to even 10,000 times

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:07.780
smaller settling time.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.280
Although it won't
be quite as small,

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.610
because also, the particles need
to accelerate to that speed.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:18.910
This settling speed here is the
terminal velocity of a drop.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.760
And there is a short
acceleration time

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.860
for very small particles.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.720
And for very long
particles, you may still

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.310
be actually in that acceleration
time when you hit the ground.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.970
So basically, it might
not be that long.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.650
But basically, the
time, at large times,

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.830
is also quite a bit reduced
for large particles.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:40.130
Now, there's also the humidity
effect, which can be seen here.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.840
So for example, if we're
at 90% relative humidity,

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.100
this factor here
is a factor of 10.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.350
So what was on the
order of a few seconds,

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.260
if we're at higher
humidity, then

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.750
this curve ends up
looking more like this.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.760
And we may follow this
curve a little bit

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.880
further and end up with
something like this.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:04.510
This would be high humidity.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.640
I'll say higher, because
I haven't gone that far.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.150
There's another curve that
I could draw where this even

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.030
goes further this
way, and where this

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.600
could start turning
into, say, 30 seconds

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.890
where that crossover occurs.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.150
But in any case, there is
a crossover at some point.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.540
And at high relative humidity,
the evaporation is slower,

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.140
and so we are more following
the settling droplets.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.560
And so this is an
important set of concepts

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.930
in the field of aerosol
science involving

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:34.740
droplets, and especially
for respiratory diseases.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.720
But it's still oversimplified.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.520
So recent research has showed
that, in fact, many droplets

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.260
that are present
from respiration

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.620
do not evaporate on these
kind of fast timescales.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.630
And in fact, they
can linger and can

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.470
be way into this small
size range of aerosols

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.730
and not disappear.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.610
And it's possible, then, to
breathe them in and transmit

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.870
disease with them.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.690
So what's missing here
is that the droplet fate

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:05.070
depends not only on the
size of the droplet,

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.870
but also on solutes.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.660
So what I mean by that is that,
of course, a droplet coming out

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.900
of your lungs and passing
through your pharynx,

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.780
your vocal chords, is
not just pure water.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.460
It's even not pure saliva.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.510
In fact, it contains
many other molecules.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.950
So of course, it contains
the pathogens themselves,

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:35.750
which are solids, and
they don't evaporate.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:40.220
So whether it's bacteria or
virus, some of that material

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.630
has to stay behind.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:47.280
There's all kinds of
organic molecules,

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.770
because in fact, the
mucus that comes out

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.750
of your lungs as a
non-Newtonian fluid that's

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.570
full of macromolecules
of different types.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.580
Those molecules are
usually charged,

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:02.680
as are, in fact, the viruses
and other pathogens as well.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.120
And so there could
also be hydration,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.310
water, so that those
water molecules,

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.060
which are not freely in solution
but were strongly interacting

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.580
with charge services,
or charged molecules,

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.210
and form so-called hydration
shells around those molecules.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.880
And finally, there
could also be salts,

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.150
because we all know that
our body is, in many cases,

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.570
similar to seawater, and
has fluids which contain

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:28.920
a large number of salts.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.190
For example, sodium
chloride or calcium.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.080
And salts love water.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.700
So in fact, it's been shown that
some respiratory aerosols are

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.100
actually observed to be
growing after they're

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.420
emitted from the body.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.190
In a humid environment,
water may actually

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.780
be condensing onto
those particles

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.400
and causing them
to grow, because it

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.950
has molecules that love water.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:54.300
And in fact, these kinds
of molecules or particles

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:59.080
that attract and hold water
are so-called hygroscopic

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.520
materials.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.540
And many respiratory--
a significant number

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.040
of respiratory droplets
are, in fact, hygroscopic.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.910
So this whole picture of
evaporation settling really

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:10.790
needs to be modified.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.760
The settling part is
going to always be there.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.520
Even a solid particle
which is settling in air

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.210
is going to obey this
Stokes settling velocity.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.760
But the evaporation
part of it is certainly

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.330
true for pure water, but is
not necessarily the right way

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.000
to think about
respiratory aerosols.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.690
So finally then,
I'll just sketch

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.900
what happens when
people have measured

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.290
respiratory distributions
of particles,

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.150
and focusing on
the aerosol range

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:47.180
of the really small particles
that might remain suspended.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.360
So these are particles like
this guy right here, which

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.780
are around 1 micron, and
will have settling times

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.770
that are on the order of hours.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.320
So those particles
that can linger

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.450
in the air for long
periods of time.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.690
And so if we look at
the number of droplets

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:06.920
that we have at
different sizes, and this

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.960
is for different
kinds of respiration--

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.000
and I'll draw this to
sketch what it would look

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.600
like on a log scale.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:18.080
So here I'll put 0.01 microns,
which is 100 nanometers.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:25.080
And then I'll put 1 micron,
and then 10 microns, and then

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.910
100 microns.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:32.810
So when you breathe,
speak, cough,

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.900
sneeze, you're letting
out a distribution

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.750
of particles of all these
different types of droplets.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.460
And those droplets
will typically

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.970
contain pathogens, such
as bacteria or virus.

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:45.760
And the way these
things look is because

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.880
of these hygroscopic
solutes, in fact,

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.840
we don't see that all the little
ones are evaporating it away

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.390
in a tiny timescale
like milliseconds,

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:56.560
but in fact, they do linger.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.770
And you do have respiratory
aerosols that can be observed.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.900
And so what these distributions
actually look like,

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:06.490
they tend to have a peak around
half a micron in diameter,

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:09.960
or a radius even smaller than
that would be a quarter micron.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.730
And so they look
something like this.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.790
And if you're
breathing at rest, it

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.850
might look something like that.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.890
And actually, the
volume fraction,

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.890
if we were to convert
this to a volume fraction,

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:26.130
ends up being around 1e-16 parts

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.930
of liquid per volume of air.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.920
So these are very
small droplets.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.740
And you can't see them,
but they're there.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.410
If you're resting breathing, you
might have something like that.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.600
There's also an important effect
of the type of respiration.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.020
So if I start talking,
then it turns out

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.750
I'm still releasing quite
a few these aerosols,

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:49.170
but now I'm also releasing
some much larger droplets.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.780
I might even be having--

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.840
depending how I'm speaking, and
in fact, my personal physiology

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.800
may vary from
person to person, I

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.010
might be emitting even more
of these larger droplets.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.560
Or also, the aerosol
droplets as well.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.060
And then there are
other activities,

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:09.810
such as singing
or exercise, where

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.180
you're breathing
very heavily, where

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.190
you emit even more droplets.

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.140
And you can see
vocalizations, singing,

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.350
and this can be, for
example, talking,

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.480
that those lead
to more emissions.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.820
But the important
thing is that there is

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:29.520
a big population of particles.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.310
In fact, the majority
of particles,

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:39.040
by number or even by volume, is
over here in the aerosol range.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.430
So these are particles
that do hang around.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:42.840
And they float around the room.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.030
And they can do so for
minutes or even hours,

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:48.900
depending on their size and
the conditions of the room.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:56.020
These here are the large
drops which will sediment out

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.510
according to this formula here.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.560
So the Stokes formula is
still going to be valid

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.790
regardless of evaporation.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.380
If we know the size,
we have a sense

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.720
of how quickly the
droplets are falling.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.849
But the ones we're really
going to want to focus on

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:10.329
are these aerosols for viruses,
because viruses are small.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.730
Whereas bacteria
are big and they

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.520
might have to be transmitting
more of the enlarged drops.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.000
So now let's talk a bit
about the biology of viruses

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.680
and bacteria and
see how that might

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:25.530
connect to the physics
of droplet transmission.
